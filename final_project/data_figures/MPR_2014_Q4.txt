Monetary Policy Report  
 
 
The Monetary Policy Report  is prepared quarterly by staff of the 
Bank of Thailand with the approval of the Monetary Policy Committee 
(MPC).  It serves two purposes: ( 1) to communicate to the public the  
MPC’s  consideration and rationales for the conduct of monetary policy, 
and (2)  to present the latest set of  economic and inflation forecast s, based 
on which  the monetary policy decisions  were made .

Monetary Policy in Thailand  
The Monetary Policy Committee  
Under the Bank of Thailand Act, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) comprise of the 
Governor and two deputy Governors, as well as four distinguished external members  
representing various sectors of the country, with the aim to provide monetary policy decisions 
that are effective and transparent.  
 
The Monetary Policy Objective  
The MPC sets monetary policy with the objective to suppor t sustainable a nd full potential 
economic growth, without causing inflationary problems or economic and financial imbalances 
or bubbles.  
 
The Monetary Policy Target  
The National Council for Peace and Order approved the use of quarterly  average core 
inflation with the range of 0.5 -3.0 percent  per annum , which was jointly proposed by the MPC 
and the Minister of Finance, as monetary policy target for 2015. In an event that core inflation 
deviates from the target, the MPC shall explain the reasons behind target breach  to the 
public, together with action plans to bring inflation back to the target.  
 
The Monetary Policy Instrument  
The MPC utilizes the 1 -day bilateral repurchase transaction rate as the policy rate to signal 
the monetary policy  stance.  
 
Evaluating economic conditions and forecasts  
The Bank of Thailand considers information from all sources, the macroeconomic model, data 
in each economic sector, as well as direct opinions from large enterprises and small and 
medium -sized  enterpr ises from all over the country,  and various financial institutions to ensure 
that economic evaluations and forecasts are accurate and covers all aspects, both in the 
macro and micro levels.   
 
Monetary Policy Communication  
Recognizing the importance of Monetary Policy communication to the public, the MPC 
arrange many forms of communication, both in Thai and English, such as (1) organizing a 
press statement at 14.00 hrs. on the day of the meeting, (2) publishing edited Minute s of the 
MPC meeting two weeks after the meeting, and (3) publishing the Monetary Policy Report  
every quarter.  Monetary Policy Report  December  2014

1.1 Growth and inflation prospects  
In 2014  and 2015, the Thai economy is 
likely to expand  by notably less than our previous 
projections . Inflationary pressure s eased  owing 
primarily to falling energy prices.  
The pace of economy recover y was 
slower than expected, particularly in 2014  Q3. 
The momentum of exports of goods and services 
was fading and the pick -up in private spending 
remained gradual due to weak  farm income s and 
high household debt. Consumption of durables 
remained well below historical averages  due to 
accelerated spending ass ociated with the first -car-
rebate scheme and delayed public spending , 
owing to restrictions on budget disbursement, 
which is likely to continue into the projection 
period . The uncertainty over timing of  public 
spending led some businesses to postpone their 
investment to reassess the outlook and  progress 
on public investment. Thus, Thailand’s economic  
growth forecast is revised down significantly The Thai economy expanded by notably less than previous project ion 
from sluggish recovery in domestic spending and less -than-expected public 
spending against the backdrop of slowing  export momentum. Meanwhile, 
inflationary pressure s eased, owing primarily to declining energy prices and weak 
demand -pull pressure s resulting from slow  economic recovery.  
For the past two meetings, the MPC voted to hold the policy rate at 2.00 
percent, th e level deemed support ive to economic  recovery and in line with our 
mandate  to maintain long-term financial stability.

Risks that the Thai economy would 
deviate from the baseline  assessment stemmed 
from lower trading partners’ GDP growth, particularly  
in the euro area, Japan and Asia where economic 
recovery remained fragile.  These downside risks 
to exports, along  with low farm prices and weak 
farm income s, would hamper  economic recovery.   
Nonetheless, the MPC also considered  
that upside risks to economic growth forecasts 
could stem from more  effective budget disbursements  
and stronger recovery in private investment 
compared to our last projection.  In addition, the 
decline in dom estic energy prices could improve 
households’ real purchasing power and lower 
costs  of production, boosting household spending 
and private investme nt by more than the baseline 
assessment.  
On the whole, the MPC agreed  on an 
assessment  that the probabilities  of the economy  
expanding lower and higher than the baseline 
projections were  largely similar . The fan chart 
for growth  forecasts  is, therefore, balanced 
throughout the projection period.  (Chart 1.2)   Table 1.1 Forecast summary

slightly downward in  2015 , as a result of waning  
demand pressure s, from subdued economic 
recover y. This is also reflected by the output gap, 
which  is expected to remain negative throughout 
the projection period. Slow recovery,  coupled with 
plunging  global oil prices from end -2014  onwards , 
caused a downward revision to  headline inflation  
projections . In this regard, the MPC concluded 
that downside and upside risks to both headline 
and core inflation s are balanced throughout the 
projection period , as reflected by  with the balance d 
assessments  of risks for economic growth and 
cost pressures from Dubai crude oil prices. 
(Charts 1.3 and 1.4)  
1.2 Economic outlook  
The economy is likely  to expand at the rate  
lower than the previous projection . The significant 
downward revision s to economic growth  forecasts  
stemmed from weak private spending and lower  
than expected public spending,  while  growth in  
merchandise exports is expected to be sluggish, 
together with slow recovery in the tourism sector . 
Additionally, some businesses  postpone d their 
investments.  
 In 2014, the Thai economy expand ed by 
notably less than the previous projection , 
owing to the much weaker economic activity 
recorded in the third quarter. The weakness in 
growth performance resulted from  lower -than-
expected domestic demand and sluggish recovery 
in exports of goods and services. Moreover, public 
spending was delayed due to restrictions on  
budget disbursement and ongoing projects being 
subjected to further cost and benefit review s. -2-101234

Note: The fan chart covers 90 percent of the probability distribution.4    Monetary Policy Report  December 2014   Moreover , recovery in private demand remained  
subdued in the last quarter of 2014,  despite  the 
short -term government stimulus. However, the 
acceleration of exports to the euro area  before  
the expiration of  the Generalized System of 
Preferences (GSP) in early 2015  along with the 
recovery in the  number of Chinese and Malaysian 
tourist s provide d a short term lift to economic 
activity.  
 Going forward, the economy in 2015 is 
expected to grow  steadily  (Chart 1.5),  driven by 
a gradual recovery in private consumption and 
planned private investment s being reali zed, for 
example, telecommunications projects. The tourism  
sector is also expected  to improve as concern s 
over domestic political uncertaint y subside d. 
 Nonetheless,  the pace of  recovery is 
slower than previously assessed due to (1) lower -
than-expected economic momentum at the end  
of 2014; (2) slower global economic recovery 
compared  to the previous assessment , resulting in 
weak merchandise exports; and 3) delayed budget 
disbursement s for public investment which are 
expected to  persist in the near term . Hence, the 
economic growth forecast in 2015 is lowered  from 
earlier estimates  (Table 1.2)

The global economy recovered slowly with 
the euro area, Japan ese and Chinese economies  
growing slower  than the previous projections . Only 
the U.S. economy was expected to expand steadily.   
Thailand’s trading partner  economies 
were  assessed to recover slower than th e 
previous projections.  (Chart 1.6)  In particular, 
core eurozone economies began to show signs of 
a slowdown while the Japanese economy was 
more negatively impacted by the consumption tax 
hike than expected. In contrast , the U.S. economy  
should  continu e to grow solidly . 
The U.S. economy is expected to continue  
expanding at a higher rate than our previous 
projections . (Chart 1.7)   Factors supportive  to 
grow th going forward  include a steady 
improvement in the labor  market ,  better business 
and consumer sentiment, a decline in oil prices, 
strengthened households’ balance sheet in line 
with rising asset prices, and the continuing 
accommodative monetary policy. Our assess ment 
is that the Fed  will maintain the fed funds rate 
before raising it in 2015 Q3, unchanged from our  
previous assumption .  
The Euro area econom ies is likely to 
expand at a slower pace than previously 
projected  (Chart 1.8) , following the slowdown  in 
the core countries due to worsening sentiment and 
the prolonged  structural reforms in some countries.  
Nonetheless, looking ahead, recovery  of the euro 
area economies should be underpinned by  
improving  geopolitical situation s between Russia 
and Ukraine, lower oil prices, and a gradual 
increase in fiscal stimulus that would lend some 
support to domestic consumption . Moreover,

the Covered Bonds Purchase Program and the 
Asset -Backed Securities Purchase Program ; along  
with additional monetary easing measures and  
a weaker euro, should further ease monetary 
conditions and lend further su pport to economic 
and financial activity .  
The Japanese economy was likely to 
expand at a slower pace than previously 
projected  (Chart 1.9)  due to subdued recovery  in 
private consumption and investment. Nonetheless, 
postponement of the next round of consumption 
tax hike from October 2015 to April 2017 should 
shore up private confidence and encourage greater  
private consumption. More clarity on fiscal stimulus  
after the general election and recovery in exports 
likely  lends support to growth  going forward. 
However, the benefits to Japan as a result of the 
weakening yen should be limited due to a change 
in Japan’s trade structure, partly from its increasing  
reliance on imports of oils and fuel  to replace the 
loss of electricity production from the closure  of 
nuclear power plants.  
The Chinese econom ic growth  is also 
revised down from our previous forecast . 
(Chart 1.10)  Investment slowed down, partly as a 
result of China’s policy to reduc e its reliance on 
investment and encourage more domestic  
consumption , in tandem with tighter supervision 
over the banking sector and stricter lending 
standards on local government debt. The efforts 
were aimed at reduc ing risky private investments 
and wasteful  infrastructure projects . Exports 
should continue to improve in line with global 
economic recovery led by the U.S.  Consumption is 
expected to healthy due to low unemployment. 
Looking ahead, the MPC agreed that the Chinese 
administration should be able to achieve the -1.50.01.53.0

implement ing the necessary structural reform s and 
launching economic stimulus .   
Asian economies (excluding Japan and 
China) are likely to expand by slightly less than 
earlier projection  (Chart 1.11) due to  the slowdown  
in trading partners’ economies, particularly in the 
euro area and Japan. Going forward, however, 
Asian economies should continue to expand, 
driven mainly by a gradual pick -up in exports 
following recovery  of the major economies, especially  
the U.S . Private consumption is assessed to grow 
briskly , on the back of  solid employment  picture  
and greater household spending power s following 
the plunge in oil prices. Investment, especially in 
machinery and equipment, is likely to expand  
albeit at a slightly slower pace.  
The MPC decided  that the  rising  U.S. 
dollar following the strength of the U.S. recovery  
will weigh on the value of Asian currencies 
compared to the previous projection . As a result,  
the outlook could cause the Thai baht to weaken 
slightly against the U.S. dollar, compared to the 
previous assessment.  
A number of downside risks to the global  
economy remain  as follows: (1)  weaker economic  
activity in the euro area and  Japan would hamper 
global growth ; (2) a possible increase in capital 
flow volatility  due to diverging  monetary polic ies of 
major economies; (3) China’s structural problems, 
especially in the shadow banking sector and local 
government debt  overhang ; and (4) a resurgence 
of geopolitical risk s in various regions causing  
greater  volatility in exchange rates and commodity 
prices.

Annual percentage change Percentage point8    Monetary Policy Report  December 2014  Thai exports  to recover slowly   
The downward revision in global economic 
growth cause s a delay in the recovery of Thai 
exports .  
Merchandise exports should recover 
slowly  in line with the global econom ic growth . 
Exports of electronics are likely to pick up due to 
strong demand from major economies. Automobile 
exports should register  a gradual  increase as 
manufacturers expanded to new markets, for 
example, the U.S. and Europe. Meanwhile, the 
outlook for exports of machinery and equipment 
and petrochemical products  is more positive  with 
strong demand from neighbor  countries. However, 
total exports will only expand at a slower pace 
than forecast throughout the projection period  
(Table 1.3) , owing to weaker recovery of foreign 
demand, lingering production  restrictions and the 
expiration of the European Union’s GSP.  
Exports of services look set  to decline 
from the previous projections,  even  though the 
tourism sector is recovering  steadily from  better  
tourist sentiment coupled with additional year-end 
stimulus  measures  such as visa fee waiver for 
Chinese and Taiwanese tourists and temporary 
allowance for Malaysian tour buses to operate 
beyond the Songkhla province. While  the number 
of East Asian tourists rebounded swiftly due to  
the shorter trip preparation , than the European  
counterparts, the number of European tourists has 
turned out  well below the forecasts  from lingering 
safety concerns, accompanied  by the weakening 
economies of the euro area and Russia . Despite a 
feeble rebound in the tourism sector, the pace of 
recovery still exceeded other sectors ’. Therefore, 
the tourism sector is projected  to be the main  
thrust behind economic growth in 2015.   Monetary Policy Report  December  2014                                     9 The current account balance1/ should 
register  a surplus in 2014  and 2015.  (Table 1.3)  
The surplus in 2014 is likely be  a result of low 
imports during the first half of the year , owing to 
weak domestic demand whereas in 2015 the 
improvement is  projected to stem from a decline  
in import s on the back of  a collapse in oil prices . 
Fiscal spending  set to  be lower than forecast   
The delay  in public spending should weaken  
economic momentum while continuity and clarity 
of government policies is necessary  for the recovery  
to gain traction . 
Public spending continued to be a driver  
of growth but will provide a smaller boost to 
growth than our earlier projection . (Chart 1.12 
and Table 1.4) Disbursement s for public investment  
was lower than expected due to (1) delay  in 
procurement since the  political crisis ; (2) 
postponement of some state enterprise investments  
due to plan revision s, for instance, the Suvarnabhumi  
airport extension project phase 2; and (3) contraints  
on public spending especially on investment such 
as the shortage of construction labo ur which 
caused budget disbursement s during the start of 
fiscal year 2015 to be well below expectations  and 
likely to be prolonged.  
The delay in budget disbursements should 
persist in the near future.  Thus, the MPC agreed  
to revise down the assumptions on disbursement 
rates for fiscal year 2015 to 92.6 percent  from 93.7 
percent . The significant downward revision was 
mainly based  on slower disbursement s for state 
enterprise projects .

revised database10    Monetary Policy Report  December 2014  Although the amount of public spending is 
likely to be  lower than earlier projections , 
continuity of public investment on infrastructure 
projects remains  key to reduce  our transportation 
bottlenecks, lower logistic al costs, enhance 
production  capacity and enable income distribution  
to rural areas . These should shore up  business 
confidenc e and encourage more business 
investment . 
Private spending to recover  only gradually  
Household consumption and private 
investment  are projected to grow at a lower rate 
than previously assessed . 
Household consumption should expand  
more slowly  than the previous projections . 
Consumption of durable  goods , particularly 
automobiles,  is likely to be postponed  because of  
uncertain ty in  economic prospects. In contrast , 
consumption of non -durables and services should 
see a steady pick-up. Looking ahead, a rebound of 
household consumption will be  supported by rising 
confidence, a gradual improvement  in the labor  
market and firming farm income s resulting from the 
economic recovery, and an increase in households’ 
purchasing power following  declining energy prices.  
However, under the MPC assess ment  that 
household spending growth  will remain sub -
par for some time  due to the higher household 
debt level compared to historical averages . The 
delay  in government support measures which 
would have softened  the negative impact of 
declining farm income s stemming from  falling rice 
and rubber prices  will further weigh on spending .

foreign demand  and plungin g crude oil price s Monetary Policy Report  December  2014                 11 continued to exert downward pressure s on rubber 
price.  
Private investment is likely  to grow by 
less than the last projection . Pick-ups in 
investment will only occur  in certain industries, for 
instance in the telecommunications industry where 
there had been  existing  plans to upgrade the 
networks to  3G and 4G to meet  higher demand s, 
and in the retail and wholesale industries with 
branch expansion to major  provinces to respond 
to new demand s from neighbor  countries once the 
AEC begins . Most businesses will continue to 
postpone investment as there is no need to 
expand production capacity while the economic  
recovery is ongoing. Additionally, some businesses  
had already invested over the past 2-3 years. 
Other businesses prefer to wait for greater clarity 
on pub lic investment policies  and the bidding of 
government infrastructure projects . Adjustment s in 
investment plans  are being made  to BOI’s new 
strategy to encourage investment in R&D. 
Nonetheless, there are positive factors  suppo rting 
investment, for example, improving  investor and 
manufacturing business sentiment, lower costs of 
production from declining oil prices, and continuing  
low interest rate s providing tailwinds to  business es. 
(Additional details in 3.2)  
The MPC  projection is that should the 
government fail to offer clarity and continuity of 
fiscal policies, including commitment to expedite 
investments in infrastructure projects, private 
investment will remain sub -par for some time , 
hurting the country’s long-term competitiveness.  12    Monetary Policy Report  December 2014  Inflationary pressure s lower than  the 
previous projections  
 Inflationary pressure s continue to edge 
lower from falling global crude oil prices and 
weakened demand -pull pressure s 
Headline and core inflation are likely  to 
soften  from last projections , in line with the 
falling global inflation trend, resulting from declining  
crude oil and commodity prices. Additionally, weak 
demand -pull pressures on the back of slow 
economic recovery further weigh on inflation.  
Projections for core inflatio n for 2015 is revised 
down marginally while those figures for headline 
inflation are significantly  reduced  especially from 
the end of 2014 to 2015 Q2 before gradually rising 
follow ing the projected economic recovery.  
Inflationary pressure s from demand 
side are likely to be subdued and weaker than 
earlier estimates  throughout the forecast 
period . The delay  in economic recovery caused 
the output gap, in part reflecting  weakening  
demand, to close later on the timeline than 
previously assessed.  The output gap will continue 
to narrow gradually with a large negative gap in 
the first half of 2014 then becoming  less negative 
following  the projected economic recovery. However,  
the output gap is not estimated to close  in the  
entire  forecast period. (Cha rt 1.13)  
Cost pressure s are likely to be down 
from the previous proje ction s in line with  
declining  crude  oil and commodity prices.  The 
Dubai crude oil price (Chart 1.14)  which fell 
sharp ly towards the end of 2014 led the MPC to 
revise down the baseline projection for Dubai 
crude oil price  in 2014  from 103.5 U.S. dollars per 
barrel to 97.1 dollars per barrel.  The downward 
revision stemmed  from a change in  investor -12-10-8-6-4-2024

maintain  production  in order to preserve its market 
share and push down oil prices, thereby reducing 
the attractiveness for the US shale oil production . 
Moreover , the demand for oil has not fully re turned  
to normal . Going forward, the MPC came to the 
conclusion that th ese factors are not transitory  
and, therefore , revised down the baseline assumption  
for Dubai crude oil price in 2015 to 73.0 U.S. 
dollars per barrel from 101.1 .0 U.S. dolla rs per 
barrel. Nonetheless, the MPC expect that oil 
prices would rise steadily in the second  half of the 
year. On the one hand, low prices currently should 
underpin  global economic recover y, lifting the 
global oil demand . On the other hand, low prices 
will deter  future investment to expand oil production  
capacity, pressuring oil supply . On balance , the 
forecast is  that Dubai crude oil price will stabilize 
at around 80 U.S. dollars per barrel towards the 
end of the projection period.  
Meanwhile, estimates fo r other  commodity  
prices are reduced from earlier and are expected  
to remain low  (Chart 1.15)  in line with low  food 
and raw material prices given global excess 
supplies . Metal price forecasts  are also adjusted  
lower than previously projected as costs of 
productions fell along  with oil prices.  
Nonetheless, the government’s policy 
to restructure domestic energy prices and the 
bath’s weakness,  in line with other regional 
currencies, limit the fall in domestic produ ction  
costs, much smaller than the actual declines in 
Dubai oil and other commodity prices.  In this 
regard, the MPC projected that retail domestic oil 
prices will be slightly lower than previous 
assumptions since the government is unlikely to 
allow  diesel price to fall by the same extent  in 
order to gradually reduce diesel subsidy. Additionally,  -100102030

Domestic fresh food prices  (Chart 1.16)  
should remain low until the end of 2015  and the 
forecast suggests lower  prices  than our previous 
projections . The changes centre on  the decline in 
rice price , stemming from the government’s rice 
destocking plans . Estimates for p rices of other 
food products are similar to the last forecast with 
shrimp and pork prices softening  after the shrimp 
and pig disease s gradually subsided.  
Alternat ive Scenarios  
The MPC are aware of the  various 
scenarios  where Thai economic growth could 
deviate from the baseline case. The MPC thus 
identified  key risk scenario  to the Thai economy 
and inflationary pressure s, going forward.  
Scenario  1: The global economy grew at 
a lower rate, particularly the Chinese and Asian 
economies which are Thailand’s major trading 
partners. The scenario would affect production  
in export -oriented industries, thereby lowering 
employment,  income and consumer confidence . 
As a result, households will be more cautious in 
their spending, delaying economic recovery and  
easing demand -pull inflationary pressure s. 
Scenario  2: Greater effective ness  in budget  
disbursements , leading to improv ing private 
sentiment and accelerated  investment  spending . 
This scenario will bolster  employment and household  
income, leading to higher private spending and 
economic growth than the  baseline assessment.

Scenario 3: low global oil prices could 
lead to stronger  global economic expansion 
and rapid recovery in domestic household and 
business spending.  This scenario will see  the 
export sector, the tourism sector, the transportation  
sector and domestic spending to grow  faster than 
anticipated . Growth performance will register  an 
improve ment  with greater  demand -pull inflationary 
pressure s from the baseline assessment.  
1.3 Monetary policy decision   
 Monetary  policy continues to be 
accommodative  
 For the past two meetings, the MPC voted 
to maintain  the policy rate at 2.00 percent . 
The MPC deemed the current monetary policy 
stance appropriately accommodative and the 
economic recovery  without leading to imbalances 
in the long -term.  
At its meeting on November 5 , 2014, the 
MPC were of the view that the global economy is 
likely to expand by slightly lower than forecast  with 
varying rates of growth  among regions. The U.S. 
economy will expand solidly  while the recovery  of 
the euro area and Japanese remain fragile  with a 
probable risk of a slowdown . The outlook for the 
Chinese and Asian economies appears  softe r. 
Meanwhile, the  forecast for the Thai econom ic 
growth  is down compared to the last projection 
due to  fading  momentum in 2014 Q3 resulting  
from the feeble recovery in  domestic demand, 
lower -than-expected government spending and 16    Monetary Policy Report  December 2014  weak  export performance. In the MPC ’s judgment  
the Thai economic activity will pick up steadily in 
2015  from improving  export  performance against  
the backdrop of  stronger global growth than in 
2014 . Moreover, public investment should  provide 
a boost to the economy,  encouraging the private 
sector to slowly follow suit . Risks to financial 
stability remain low. Inflation declined in line with 
falling energy and agricultural prices , coupled  with 
subdued demand -pull pressure s. The MPC thus 
deemed  the current monetary policy stance  to be 
sufficiently accommodative  to foster economic  
recovery and ensure long -term financial stability.  
The Committee  thus voted 6 to 1 to maintain  the 
policy rate at 2.00 percent (one dissenter  wishing 
to lower the policy rate by 0.25 percent ). Moreover,  
the MPC expressed concern s over increasing risks 
to economic recovery stemming from  the uncertain  
global economy and the pace of public investment.  
With o ne member holding the view  that looser 
monetary policy would provide an additional thrust 
to the Thai economic recovery . The MPC continue,  
therefore , to closely monitor developments in the 
economy and to conduct monetary policy in such 
a way  to sustain economic momentum and to  
promote financial stability.  
At the meeting on December  17, 2014, the 
assessment from the MPC is  in 2014 the Thai 
economy expand ed close to forecasts . Recovery 
had been  gradual with domestic private spending 
as the main engine of growth. In 2015, the 
economy should  gain traction but growth estimate 
is lower ed compared to earlier projection  due to 
stimulus from public spending  falling short of 
anticipation , which in turn affects  private investment  
as most businesses continue to wait for greater 
clarity on public investment. Furthermore, risk s to 
recovery for merchandise exports could arise from Monetary Policy Report  December  2014                 17 increasing global economic uncertaint y. Meanwhile,  
the tourism sector  should show signs of  a rebound  
but its growth will remain  sub-par. Headline inflation  
will dip  from continuing falls in energy prices and 
should  remain low for an extended period  in line 
with global oil prices. In tandem , core  inflation will 
move down from waning  demand -pull pressure s 
due to the slow economic recovery. Risks to 
financial  stability remain low. The build -up of risks 
from the prolonged low interest environment does 
not yet pose a threat. Most members decided that 
the current monetary policy stance  is sufficiently 
accommodative and should underpin a gradual 
recovery in 2015 and in line with our mandate  to 
ensure long -term financial stability. Two members 
argued for further monetary policy easing to 
provide an additional thrust to the feeble economic 
recovery against the backdrop of increasing risks 
to global economic expansion and continued low 
inflation. The MPC thus voted 5 to 2 to maintain 
the policy rate at 2.00 percent (two dissenters 
opting for a 0.25 per cent cut). 
 Nevertheless , all members concurred that 
monetary policy must continue to be accommodative  
to ensure that economic recovery gain traction 
while another key driving force is  to ensure 
accelerated public spending remain on  target.

Percent2015 2016Monetary Policy Report  December 2014   21 Decline of g lobal oil price s: implications for  the Thai economy  
 The continual decline in global 
crude oil prices d uring the latter half of 
2014 (Chart 1)  which owed mainly to the 
supply increase  clearly reflects  a structural  
shift in the global oil market. The slowdown  
in demand for oil due to the gradually 
improving global eco nomic outlook, 
meanwhile,  plays  a minor role.  
The aforementioned structural 
shift stems  from the increase in sup ply 
from Non -OPEC countries , particularly 
the U.S. which succeeded in developing 
a suitable  method  to extract shale oil1/, 
allowing  high quantity shale oil production  
at lower costs. Accordingly, U.S. total  
oil supply in 2014 has reached the  
highest peak in 31 years (Chart 2) . This 
development  has also  led to a decline in 
the role of the OPEC in dictating the 
direction of global oil prices.   
 In the new equilibrium of the 
global oil market, the outlook for oil prices 
would likely remain low for some time 
compared to the average price over the 
past 3 -4 years. Apart from the structural 
consideration, there has also been  a 
downward pressure which stemmed from 
the OPEC’s change in  strategy in which  it no longer relies  on previous practice of cutting output to 
maintain price. At its latest meeting on November 27, 2014, the OPEC decided to keep  output at 
30 million barrels per day to  maintain market s hare, also hoping that low prices would reduce the 
incentive for shale oil production. Moreover, global oil demand would likely continue to slow down 
in the periods ahead given the early stage of global economic recovery, a decline in the U.S. oil 
intensity and Japan’s return to relying more on  nuclear power.  
During the next 1 -2 years, oil prices would gradually increase in line with the narrow ing of 
the oil supply -demand gap, owing  to an increase in demand following the global economic 
recovery and a reduction in new supplies due to low prices that would likely dri ve high -cost 
producers from the market s and reduced investment incentives. Nonetheless, a decline in the 
OPEC’s role following the shift in supply structure coupled with the likelihood that the U.S. would 
annul the law on prohibitio n of crude oil exports which has  been in place for more than 39 years, 
would be the key factors prevent ing prices from rising as much  as in the past. The exception, of 
course, would be the case of global geopolitic al risk s which could affect important oil producing 
regions .

 Overall, the decrease in oil prices would positively affect the global economy since net 
oil importing countries account  for 75 percent in terms of the size of the global economy, 
higher than net oil exporting countries which would be worse off. The decrease in oil prices 
would affect the real economy through 2 channels. (1) The direct channel through trade where 
net oil im porting countries such as the U.S., Japan and most Asian countries would benefit 
from lower oil import costs through higher terms of trade2/, leading to improvement in trade 
balances. (2) The indirect channel through lower inflation and costs which would h elp support 
domestic spending through higher purchasing power. Most Asian countries with high 
proportion of oil -related goods and services in their Consumer Price Index (CPI) basket, such 
as Singapore and South Korea, would greatly benefit from lower oil p rices. Meanwhile,  
a decline in costs of production would also help improve corporate profitability, leading to 
higher retained earnings which could then be reinvested.  
 The benefits that each country would receive would differ depending on their 
economic  structures, for example, oil export and import structures, industri al structure, 
government policy  and price sensitivity of businesses and households. By considering the oil 
export and import structures of regional  
countries, most EMEs are net oil 
importers. Thailand, in particular, would  
benefit from the decrease in oil prices 
the most , ranking  highest in terms of 
net oil imports of 9.4 percent of GDP in 
2013. (Chart 3)  Meanwhile, Malaysia 
would  lose out through the decline in 
export value in line with lower prices of 
energy export products. The decrease 
in global oil prices would benefit 
Thailand’s current account and domestic  
demand as follows.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                             
2/ A country’s terms of trade reflects its gain from international trade, calculated as the proportion of export 
price (P x) to import price (P m) multiplied by 100. A number less than 100 reflects that prices of Thai exports 
are lower than prices of Thai imports, on average. To maintain the trade balance, Thailand must ensu re 
that export volume is higher than import volume. An increase in terms of t rade implies that Thailand gains 
from international trade.

Percentage of GDP
Source: IIF and Bank of Thailand ( 2013 data)Monetary Policy Report  December 2014   23 Impact on current account   
 The decrease in oil prices would  
benefit Thailand’s current account 
mainly through the trade balance. 
Thailand would directly benefit from 
higher terms of trade (Charts 4 and 5)  
since the proportion of its imports  
of crude oil and oil  price sensitive  
products3/ (25.9 percent of total imports)  
are higher than the proportion of its 
exports of the same product categories . 
(18.6 percent of total exports )   Moreover,  
it is expected that the decrease in oil 
prices may not stimulate much more  oil 
imports as the outlook for the domestic 
economy and exports continues to slow 
down. This observation is reflected by 
the import volume during the first 10 
months of 2014 which has decreased 
to only 21.1 million barrels per month 
compared with the average import 
volume of 25.1 million barrels per 
month during 2007 – 2013. As a result, 
the higher terms of trade would li kely 
be a key factor to support improvement  
in the trade balance. In this regard, 
Thailand’s terms of trade in October 
2014 stood at 103.7, t he highest level 
since March 2011.  
  For the transfers and services 
account, the decrease in oil prices 
would likely lead to higher number of 
foreign tourists as their transportation 
expenditures decline.  Nonetheless, in 
the short run , it is expected that the 
decrease in oil prices would not support  
recovery of the number of foreign 
tourists much due to the following 
reasons. (1) E conomic conditions in 
countries where the major groups of 
tourists come from are slowing down. 
Moreover, recently , Thailand’s tourism 
sector has become more dependent

(Chart 6)  (2) Tourist confidence on Thailand’s political situation has not fully recover ed. (3 ) A 
time lag is  needed for air ticket prices to reduce as pricing depends chiefly on oil price 
stability. It would be difficult for the airlines to increase air ticket prices should oil prices 
rebound  However, in the long  run, a continual decrease in oil prices would ben efit the 
transfers and services account given that the increase in the number of foreign tourists 
following the global economic recovery would surpass the number of Thai tourists travelling 
abroad.  
Impact on domestic demand  
Changes in oil prices would ben efit private spending through reduction in energy 
expenditures and higher purchasing power. Consumption would gain from the outlook of 
lower inflation from both the direct effect of oil prices and electricity charge s (accounting for 
11.4 percent of the CPI  basket) and the indirect effect of prices of other goods. The decrease 
in expenditures would help improve households’ financial condi tions, enabling them to spend  
more on  other goods.   
Meanwhile, the business sector would gain from lower costs of pr oduct ion. Analysis of 
the Input -Output Table reveals that the decrease in oil prices during August – December (36 
percent for crude oil prices and 9 percent  for retail oil prices ) has resulted in a 1.4 percent 
decrease in costs of production, with 0.5 percent c oming directly from the decrease in oil 
prices and 0.9 percent coming indirectly from the reduction in raw material and intermediate 
good costs which followed the decrease in oil prices. The decline in costs of production 
coupled with greater demand stemmi ng from higher households’ purchasing power would 
enhance businesses’ liquidity and provide support to  their financial conditions during the times 
of slow economic recovery. Businesses that would benefit from lower costs of production the 
most include high  energy -intensity industries, for example, transportation, mining, metal and 
chemical. Moreover, results from the BOT macroeconometic model suggest that a 10 percent 
decrease in global oil price would reduce headline inflation by 0.4 percent and increase G DP 
by 0.2 percent.4/   
Nonetheless, the decrease in domestic retail oil prices over the second half of the 
year has  been quite small compared to that in global crude oil prices. Thus, the preliminary 
positive impact on consumption would not be as significant, in part due to existing energy 
taxes which serve as an automatic cushion in reducing the volatility of  retail prices. For 
Thailand’s case, the low pass -through in the early stage has also reflect ed the reimbursement 
of government subsidies via reduction of excise tax and maintenanc e of negative Oil Fund 
balance in previous periods as well as  the restructuring of domestic energy prices to better 
reflect actual costs such as the gradual increase in retail prices of LPG and NGV. Although 
the energy pricing reform would diminish some positive effects of the decrease in crude oil 
prices on the economy in the short run , it is necessary to align energy price structure with 
actual costs in order to enhance country’s energy efficiency and energy secur ity in the long run .

2.1 The global economy  
The global economy continued to recover , 
led by  the U.S.. The e uro area and Japanese 
economies remained weak , while  the Asian and 
Chinese economies likely slowed down . 
The U.S. economy expanded solidly on the 
back of  continu ed improvement in its fundamentals . 
In 2014 Q3 , the U.S. economy grew by 3.9 
percent , (qoqsaar, second estimate)  down  from 
4.6 percent in the previous quarter , due to  strong  
private consumption and investment. Meanwhile, 
the surge  in public spending in this quarter was 
expected to be temporary. (Chart 2.1)  
The US eco nomic activities for 2014 Q4  
should show continuing  expansion  as reflected by 
the readings of key leading  indicators in October  
and November, for example, the manufacturing  
and services  Purchasing Manager ’s Indices (PMI), 
retail sales , and employment. In particular, continued   The global economic recovery lost some momentum. Although the U.S. 
economy continued to pick up steadily due to  improving  fundamentals, recovery 
in the euro area and Japan remained fragile from lingering structural problems. 
Meanwhile,  indicators  from the Asian and Chinese economies signaled a slower 
expansion . 
 The Thai econom ic recovery turned out weaker than expected following a 
weak momentum in the third quarter , stemming  from subdued  domestic demand. 
The public sector continued to be the main growth driver, albeit to a lesser extent. 
Meanwhile, exports recovered slowly. The supply side , especially in the tourism 
sector , showed some improvement though at a slower pace than antic ipated .

consumption and exports. However, most leading 
indicators signaled a slowdown  in economic 
activities going forward . 
In 2014 Q3 , the euro area econom ies 
showed  a slight expansion of  0.2 percent (qoqsa) , 
mainly driven by growth in private consumption 
and exports. In particular , Spanish private 
consumption and exports saw some improvement 
as its  labor market reforms brought down the unit 
labor cost  significantly . By contrast , the Italian 
economy contracted for two consecutive quarters , 
owing to falling investment and subdued  
consumption . 
In 2014 Q4, the euro area econom ies 
showed signs of slowdown , as reflected by key 
confidence indicators  for the first two months of 
the quarter. The Consumer Confidence Index and 
the European Commission Sentiment Index edged 
down from the previous  quarter . Likewise, the 
Composite Output PMI slowed down (Chart 2.2) , 
while  the reading of Germany’s m anufacturing 
PMI signaled  a contraction for the first time in 17 
months. Furthermore, German y’s new foreign orders  
weakened in October , owing to softening economic  
prospects, both within and outside the euro area , 
as well as the  fallouts from the sanction  on Russia .

In 2014 Q 3, the Japanese economy 
contracted  by 0.5 percent (qoqsa) (Chart 2.3)  due 
to a continu ous fall  in private investment and  a

of the consumption tax hike in the second quarter. 
Public spending and net foreign demand saw a

accelerated, in part as a result of the government’s  
targeted measures, implemented during the first 
half of the year, which focused on supporting the 
agricultural sector and SMEs.  
The Chinese econom y in 2014 Q4  likely 
slowed down in line with falling  investment in the 
manufacturing sector. Moreover, spare capacity in 
certain industries , such as  metal, glass and 
cement , indicated no immediate need for additional

in 2014 Q3  edged up somewhat , due to higher 
food prices and a reduction in subsidies , but 
remained within the target range. During 2014 Q3, 
most central banks maintained the policy rates at 
a level supportive of economic growth.  
In 2014 Q4 , the latest readings  of the 
leading indicators suggested that the Asian 
economies would expand at a similar pace  to the 
previous quarter. Domestic demand remained  
stable. Although consumer spending was boosted 
by declining oil prices, private investment likely  
softened , reflected by slower growth of corporate 
credits  in the recent periods . Exports  continued to 
grow at roughly th e same rate as the previous  
quarter , with the U.S. economic recovery helping 
to offset weakening demand from the Chinese and 
the euro area economies.  
2.2 The domestic economy  
 The Thai economy recovered at a pace 
slower than previously projected , due to a much 
weaker  momentum in 2014 Q3  associated with  
tepid growth of  domestic demand, particularly 
private consumption. The public sector continued 
to be the main driver of growth but to a lesser 
extent than previously projected. Exports recovered  
slowly , while the supply side , especially in the 
tourism sector, showed some  improvement though 
at a slower pace than anticipated . 
 Latest economic conditions  
 The Thai econom ic recover y was softer  
than previously projected. The overall production 30  Monetary Policy Report  December  2014  activities  saw a gradual improvement thanks to  the 
economic recovery. In 2014 Q3, the Thai economy 
expanded by a mere 0.6 percent from the same 
period last year  (Chart 2.5) , due to strong  growth 
in the service sector , particularly in the transportation  
and telecommunications sectors. Other tourism -
related service sector s improved slowly , owing to 
a lower -than-expected increase  in the number  
of tourists. Meanwhile , manufacturing production  
increased  gradually in line with the economic 
recovery.  
 Agricultural production  showed a sign of  
expan sion, after contracting in September and 
October 2014 , due to an increase in rice 
production . However, o verall agricultural prices 
continued to trend downwards , mainly driven  by 
weakening rubber and rice prices  following  a 
decrease in foreign demand, low crude oil prices , 
and inventory rundown from the government ’s rice 
scheme . As a result , farm income s continued to 
contract and weigh on private consumption 
recovery. In 2014 Q3, agricultural production 
expanded by 1.7 percent from the same period 
last year (Chart 2.6) , as vegetable and fruit  
production  improved  with favorable weather 
conditions , while livestock production also rose in 
line with a  pickup in foreign demand. However, 
rice output contracted as the harvest season was 
pushed back  due to inadequate water supply as a 
result of this year’s late monsoon season. 
Nonetheless, rice output  is anticipated to  increase 
again in the fourth quarter. At the same time, 
rubber production  decreased from the same 
period last year as rubber farmers slowed tapping   
due to a significant decline in prices following  a 
plunge in global demand.  
 The manufacturing sector  recovered 
steadily though at a slower pace than previously -10-505101520

and foreign demand and the fact that some firms  
had already run down inventories  in the previous 
periods. Looking ahead, the overall manufacturing 
production should recover steadily , in line with 
firmer recovery in domestic demand . In 2014 Q3, 
manufacturing production contract ed by 0.7 
percent  from the same period last year  (Chart 
2.7), consistent  with the prevailing low rate of 
capital utilization  (Chart 2.8).  On the whole, 
however, manufacturing production was expected 
to improve  in line with  a brighter outlook in the 
export -oriented sector . For instance , electronic 
circuit production continued to grow in line with 
stronger  foreign demand for production inputs. 
Hard Disk Drive (HDD) production picked up 
gradually , due to the recent rundown of inventories  
and a slow recovery in global demand. However, 
domestic -oriented manufacturing contracted during  
the closure of major petroleum refineries for 
repair s and upgrades at the beginning and at the 
end of the third quarter. Beer production also 
decre ased as firms chose to run down inventories 
which  had been accumulat ed in the previous  
quarter. Meanwhile, domestic and export -oriented 
production contracted due to a slower -than-
expected recovery in automobile purchases , 
coupled with a drop in demand from  the Middle 
East and Indonesia.  
 Activities in the trade sector  expanded 
modestly due to a slower -than-anticipated  recovery  
in consumption of durables as consumers’ 
purchasing  power was weighed  down  by high 
indebtedness and subdued  agricultural prices. As 
a result, automobile sales should  remain  weak for 
some time. However, the improvement in household  
spending and confidence  helped sustain the 
momentum , compared to a 0.6 percent growth in

expansion in wholesale trade in fuel and 
agricultural raw materials , along with retail trade in 
food, garment and department store s. 
 The service sector  recovered, albeit 
weaker  than previously projected. In 2014 Q3, the 
service sector expanded by 1.9 percent from the 
same period last year . The expansion was 
particularly evident in the  transportation and 
telecommunication sectors . The recovery in the 
service sector was further supported by  rising 
consumer confidence  owing to  greater clarity on 
government policies. Importantly, the tourism 
sector was expected to improve thanks to  a 
number of factors such as the gradually improving 
tourist sentiment, the introduction of travel 
stimulus measures such as the visa fee waiver for 
Chinese to urists and the temporary allowance of 
Malaysian tour buses to operate beyond the 
Songkhla province, as well as lower costs of 
international travels from declining  global oil 
prices. In this regard, the number of tourists in 
October grew by 6.1 percent from  the same period 
last year (Chart 2.9)  after contracting every month 
since January 2014. Nonetheless, the recovery of 
travel -related service sectors continued to be slow 
as a number of  countries maintained their travel 
advisories  on account of the  martial law in 
Thailand , while tourists from Europe and Russia, 
accounting for a quarter of the total tourists, 
continued to decrease due to the economic 
slowdown  in Europe  
 In 2014 Q3, t he construction sector  
showed a gradual improvement , after contracting 
by 2.7  percent from the same period last year , in 
line with a brighter outlook  in private investment,  a 
recovery of the real estate sector, and continu ing

October indicated a pickup in  construction activities  
undertaken by  the public sector.  
 Activities in t he r eal estate sector  
returned to a modest expansion  and looked set to 
recover going forward . This development was 
consistent with elevated  household debt,  a 
cautious lending  to the real estate sector , and the 
developers’ adoption of a wait -and-see approach 
in order to assess the continuity of economic 
recovery before launching new projects. In 2014 
Q3, the real estate sector expanded by 0.2 
percent from the same period last year from both 
the demand and supply sides.  
 Nevertheless, employment  in both the 
manufacturing and the service sectors  continued  
to improve, particularly in the hotel and restaurant 
and transportation sectors. Meanwhile, low 
agricultural  prices discouraged  farmers from 
increasing plantation areas , while induc ing labor 
relocation away from the agricu ltural sector. The 
movement helped alleviate the problem of labor 
shortage in non -farm sectors that had become 
very severe in previous periods. Overall, latest 
data in October revealed that Thailand’s 
unemployment rate remained low at 0.8 percent. 
(Chart 2 .10)  
 A pickup in demand was  slower than 
expected  due to  soft domestic spending . This  
gradual improvement was seen in  private 
consumption , public spending , and the e xports of 
goods and services which showed a weaker 
expansion  than previously projected . (Table 2.1)

At the same time, spending on durables was 
deemed to have bottomed  out (Chart 2.13) , 
though still lower from the same period last year 
and recovered only slowly due to (1) elevated  
household d ebt; (2) financial institutions’ ongoing 
caution towards household loans; and (3) a slump

by 2014 Q3 private investment which returned to 
expand at 3.9 percent from the same period last 
year after  contracting for four consecutive quarter s. 
(Chart 2.14)  Momentum of private investment was 
sustained  until October, owing to an expansion of 
the manufacturing sector’s machinery and 
equipment  investment and the acceleration of 
telecommunications investment, for example, 
mobile communication network expansion and 
high-speed internet. The i mprovement in investment  
was in part due to better  business sentiment as 
the BOI continued to approve initiatives regarding 
investment promotion and permits for factory 
operation  (Ror.Ngor.4) . Investment in the construction  
sector still contracted from the same period last 
year but an improvement was noted in the real 
estate sector, particularly the construction of 
condominiums along the BTS lines. Major retail 
businesses also began to expand their regional 
networks.  
 During the same period, merchandise 
exports  recovered gradually.  In 2014 Q3 , the 
volume of exports contracted by 1.4 percent 
(Table 2.1 ) mainly due to contraction in automobile  
exports for which there was a decrease in demand 
from major trading partners, a drop in petroleum 
exports in line with the temporary closure  of 
refineries for repair s and upgrades , and lower gold 
exports due to last year’s high base effect. 
Meanwhile, exports of machinery and equipment, 
petrochemical products, electronic products and 
agricultural products continued to expand strongly . 0102030405060

Source:  National Economic and Social Development BoardPercent36  Monetary Policy Report  December  2014  Nonethel ess, total exports began to rise in the last 
month of the  third quarter and continued into 
October, owing to temporarily accelerated exports 
to the euro area economies before the expiration 
of the GSP in 2015 , along with higher demand 
from the U.S. and the Asian economies.  
 Exports of services  were well below  the 
previous projections.  In 2014 Q3, exports of 
services contracted by 12.4 percent (Table 2.1  
and Chart 2.15 ) as a number  of countries 
continued to maintain the ir travel advisories for 
Thailand , and hence denting the tourist confidence . 
Moreover, a slowdown in the euro area and 
Russian economies led to a decline in tourists 
from these countries. By contrast, t he number of 
Asian tourists, a major contributor to Thailand’s 
tourism industry , contin ued to rebound , particularly 
Chinese tourists who adjust ed travel plans fairly  
quickly in response to  the improved political 
situation in Thailand. In October, the tourism 
sector recovered notably from the return of 
Chinese and Malaysian tourists, with the latter 
owing to the government’s allowance for Malaysian  
tour buses to operate beyond the Songkhla 
province until the end of the month.  
 The gradual recovery of domestic spending,  
particularly private consumption and investment, 
along with exports, led to some improvement in 
imports  (Chart 2.16) , including  raw materials , 
intermediate goods, capital goods and consumption 
goods.  Overall impor ts thus contracted by less 
compared to the same period last year.  
 Public expenditures  were pushed back 
from the original schedule, resulting in weaker 
economic momentum.  In 2014 Q3, public 
expenditures  stabilized from the same period last 
year (Chart 2.17)  due to  salary and wage  rises . In -10-50510152025

than expected due to a delay in the procurement 
process , which stemmed from the political crisis  
earlier , and the reviewing and auditing process in 
order to enhance the transparency of public 
spending. Furthermore, the government’s short -
term stimulus measures , introduced in the fourth  
quarter  with an aim to accelerat e capital budget 
disbursement s, saw limited p rogress  as the 
government agencies  faced disbursement 
restrictions . This, therefore , result ed in less funds 
being injected into the economy  than previously 
expected . Nonetheless, it was assessed that the 
impact of these short -term stimulus measures 
would be more not iceable from the beginning of 
next year . 
2.3 Costs and Prices  
Inflation  
Headline inflation over  the first two months 
of 2014 Q4  averaged at 1.37 percent, edging  
down from the last quarter as prices of energy and 
raw food  declined . The pass -through of LPG price 
to prepared food wound down, causing core 
inflation to ease . (Chart 2.18)  
Prices  of energy decelerated from the 
previous quarter as domestic retail oil prices  
declined in line with a downward  trend in  global oil 
prices . Such trend  was caused by an increase  
in oil supply , as a result of technological 
advancement  in shale oil production in the U.S. , 
and the OPEC’s maintenance of production

percentage change calculations by Bank of ThailandMonetary Policy Report  December  2014                  39 Production cost conditions  
The o verall production cost s remained 
low, as reflected in the  drop in the Producer Price 
Index by 1.5 percent (yoy) during the first two 
months of 2014 Q4 (Chart 2.20) . This was mainly  
due to a continued  fall in the prices of 
manufacturing products in line with global 
commodity prices, particularly oil. In this regard,  
the decline in oil prices stemmed from a jump in  
supply thanks to technological advancement in the 
shale oil production in the U.S. , coupled with the 
recent structural shift s in the global oil mar ket. The 
lower cost s of production, however, did not raise 
concern s over deflation as it had not resulted in  a 
broad -based reduction in the prices of goods and 
services.  
Inflationary pressure s in the periods ahead  
Inflationary pressure s over the next two 
quarters are likely to remain benign in line with a 
downward trend in global commodity prices,  
especially crude oil. While cost pressure s could 
edge up somewhat following  a gradual phase -out 
of NGV and LPG subsidies, the effect on inflat ion 
is expected to be minimal  given the absence of 
demand  pressure s. Meanwhile, inflation expectation s 
continued to fall and it is expected that the 
government will soon  introduce some price 
administration measures.  
(1) Cost pressure s are projected to  be low 
in line with global crude oil and commodity prices.

phase -out of NGV and LPG price  subsidies (the 
latter for the transport ation  and household

costs . Nonetheless, the effect is likely to be 
marginal , as the prevailing downward trend in oil

energy price restructuring. As a result , cost 
pressure s should remain low  in the near future.

3.1 Financial markets   
Money market interest rates remained 
stable in line with the policy interest rate. Short -
term government bond yields remained quite 
stable, while medium - to long -term government 
bond yields decreased predominantly due to  
foreign and local investors ’ increasing concerns 
towards  Thailand’s  and global economic recovery .  
Money and bond markets   
Short -term money market interest rate s 
remained stable close to the policy interest rate  in 
line with th e MPC’s decisions on November 5 and 
December 17, 2014, to hold the policy interest rate 
at 2.00 perc ent per annum. As of December, 17 , 
2014, the interbank lending rate and the 1 -month 
govern ment bond yield stood at 1.90 and 2.01 per  Thailand’s overall economic and financial stability was well maintained. 
Money market interest rates remained stable in line with the policy interest rate 
and continued to accommodate economic recovery. While expansion of deposits 
and credits decelerated follwoing  the economic slowdown, financial institutions’ 
financial strength continued to be sound. Fragilities in non -financial institutions 
sector lessened in accordance with  economic  recovery trend. Corporate 
profitability improved slightly from the previ ous quarter and the real estate sector 
picked up gradually.  
 Looking ahead, the MPC assessed that salient risks needed to be 
monitored included (1) market perception towards the higher degree of  monetary 
policy divergence and economic growth discrepencies between advanced 
economies namely the U.S., euro area, and Japanese economies, which could 
lead to EMEs capital flows volatility; and (2) the continuity of Thailand’s economic 
recovery which would affect income and debt servicing  ability of the private sector 
in the periods ahead.

monetary  conditions continued to be accommodative  
enough to facilitate  economic recovery as reflected  
by the negative real policy rate. (Chart 3.2)  In 
addition, from the business sentiment survey, th e 
policy interest rate was not a  primary restriction to 
business  operations  as oppose d to the top three  
factors , namely  domestic demand, production cost 
and difficulty in price adjustment.  (Chart 3.3)   
Short -term go vernment bond yields remained  
quite stable during October and November 2014. 
While overall medium - to long -term government 
bond yields decreased notably  due to investors’ 
increas e in demand follow ing the expectation of a 
flattening  yields curve . This expectation was  the 
result of concerns over Thailand’s slow economic 
recovery,  especially after  the lower -than-expected 
2014 Q3 GDP, coupled  with a decreasing trend in 
inflation. In addition, during O ctober 2014, supply 
side factor s namely  new auctions of government 
bond s, were  lower than market expectations . In 
addition , a reduction  in medium - to long -term 
government bond yields was in line with the U.S. 
government bond yields  which decreased partly 
due to the market anticipation that the Fed would 
continue its accommodative policy stance for 
some perio ds following the weak global recovery 
prospect  after disappoint ing advanced economies’ 
data. As of December 17, 2014, Thai land’s  10-year 
government bond yield  stood at 2.87 per annum,  
decreasing  by approximately 60 bps from the end 
of 2014 Q3. (Chart 3.4 )

From October to November 2014, t he Stock

Index rose slight ly to 1,594 points . (Chart 3.5)

as compared to regional currencies.  
As of December 16, 2014, the Thai baht 
stood at 32.98  baht pe r U.S. dollar, depreciating 
by 1.7 percent from the end of last quarter (Chart 
3.7) owing to (1) an appreciation in the U.S. dollar 
as reflected  by the continuous increase of the 
Dollar Index following an improvement in the U.S. 
economy and the  Fed’s decision to discontinu e 
QE3 at the end of October 2014 . In addition, the  
market  perceived  increasing policy  divergence for 
advanced economies  namely  the U.S., the euro 
area and Japan ; and (2) investors’ concern over a 
possible slower -than-expected recover y of  the 
Thai economy  after disappointing  economic  data 
and subsequent downward revisions in GDP 
forecasts .     
 An appreciation of the Thai baht against 
the euro,  the Japan yen and the majority of 
regional currencies (Chart 3 .8) resulted in an 
increase in the  NEER. As of November 2014, the 
NEER stood at 106.86, appreciating  by 1.3 
percent from the previous quarter (Chart 3.9 ). In 
this connection, the Japanese yen  depreciated  
markedly  following a slowdown in its economy  
which led to further easing  of monetary  policy. 
Likewise, recession in the euro a rea caused the 
euro t o depreciate  as the European Central Bank 
(ECB) ease d monetary policy  further  through the 
purchase of government and private bonds, and 
stand  ready to implement further easing measures 
if necessary.  The Korean won depreciated following  
the Japanese yen because the  authorities  
intended to maintain export competitiveness  
against  Japan. Also, the Malaysian r inggit  
depreciated from the market ’s concern over lower  
future government revenue  from oil exports , 
following a declining trend in  global oil price s. 72747678808284868890

of the four largest commercial banks stood at 6.75 
percent per annum at the end of November 2014, 
unchanged from the end of 2014 Q3.  
Private credits slowed down in 2014 Q3. 
At the end of October 2014, private credits 
expanded  by 5.4 percent from the same period 
last years, decelerating  from 6.5 percent at  the 
end of 2014 Q2, (Chart 3. 11) owing to a slowdown  
in both credits to the corporate and household 
sector s. Corporate credits  declined due to recovery  
in private investments which was still at the early 
stage, coupled with financial institutions ’ tighten ing 
in credit  standard s on SME  loans due to  concern 
on the worsened  debt service ability.  In addition, a 
number of large corporate s also switched  to raise 
funds through  issuing  corporate bonds . (Chart 
3.12) Household credits  slowed down mainly from 
a contraction in  demand for auto leasing from the 
same  period last  year while growth in other types 
of household  credits  remained stable.  
New loan s remained low compare d to 
historical average  though some signs of improvement  
were noted in October. (Chart 3.1 3) For the 
period s ahead, credits were  expected to expand 
more favorably  as economic recovery  firmed up . 
The outlook  was in line with the Senior Loan 
Officers’ s urvey  which  indicat ed that there would 
be an increas e in demand both  for credits to the 
household and corporate sector s while credit 
standard s would remain tight  as was the case in  
earlier periods . 
In 2014 Q3, deposits and bills of exchange 
(B/E) continue d to slow down. At the end of

down from 3.8 percent recorded at the end of 
2014 Q2 , mainly due to a  slowdown in commercial 
banks’ deposits in tandem with private credits. 
(Chart 3.14 ) In addition, deposit ors relocated 
deposits to invest in other types of higher -yield 
savings under the currently low interest rate  
environment. However, new deposits from both 
the corporate and household sector s tended to 
increase continuously since August 2014 , partly 
due to an increase in competition for deposits 
through special deposit  products. (Chart 3.15 ) At 
the end of 2014 Q2, c ommercial banks’ loan to 
deposit and B/E ratio stood at 98.3 percent, 
decreasing from 96.4 percent at the end of 
October 2014 (Chart 3.16 )  
Stability of financial institutions  
Stability of financial institution s in 2014 Q3 
remained sound. Despite some impact of the 
economic slowdown which caused private credits 
to decelerate and loan quality to deteriorate, 
provisioning for loss and doubtful loans continued 
to be high to absorb potential economic uncertainties.  
Commercial b anks capital remained high .  
In 2014 Q3, commercial bank  profitability 
reduced from the previous quarter due to higher 
operating expense s and lower  dividend income . 
As a result,  commercial bank  profitability declined 
from 59.8 billion baht in the previous quarter to 
53.8 billion baht  this quarter . (Table 3.1)  
The slow economic recovery from both 
internal and external demand affected loan quality 
to slig htly deteriorate as reflected  by higher  
delinquency and NPL ratio , especially for consumer  
loans. (Chart 3.17 ) 95.0

provisioning for loss and doubtful loans continued 
to be high to absorb  potential economic 
uncertainty. T he ratio of actual loan loss provision 
to regulatory loan loss provision stood highly at 
166.9 perc ent. In addition, the Capital Adequacy 
Ratio remained high at 17.1 percent, increasing 
from 15.9 percent in the previous quarter.  
3.3 Non-financial sectors  
Fragilities in the non -financial sectors were 
reduced . Corporate profitability gradually  improved 
following a gradual  economic recovery trend. The 
real estate sector recovered  slowly . The effect of 
economic outlook  on d ebt servicing ability and 
income of  the private sector  remained an 
important risk to be monitor ed in the periods 
ahead . 
Household sector   
New household debt accumulation continued  
to decelerate. H owever , debt service burden of 
households remained high and resulted in a slight 
deterioration in household debt servicing ability. 
With this limitation,  growth  in household spend ing 
would continue to be sub -par for some periods 
ahead .  
Growth in household debt (loan to 
households from financial institutions) continued to 
decelerate from 11.4 percent at the end of 2013 to 
10.1 percent and 8.1 percent at the end of 2014 
Q1 and 2014 Q2, respectively. (Chart 3.18 ) Risk 
of n ew debt accumulatio n reduced due to

spending and financial institutions’ tight ened  credit 5101520

high as reflected by the ratio of household 
financial assets to household debt which stabil ized 
at 2. (Chart 3.1 9) 
Nonetheless, debt servicing ability of 
households slightly deteriorated owing to high 
household  debt burden and  a slower -than-
expected  economic recovery . In this regard, the 
delinquency and NPL ratio of commercial banks’ 
consumer loans rose from 5.9 percent at the end 
of 2014 Q2 to 6.2 at the end of 2014 Q3. (Table 
3.1) Such high level of debt would  restrict 
household spending , resulting in its sub -par 
expansion for some time. In the periods ahead, 
the effects of economic recovery outlook on 
household income , household spending  and 
household debt servicing ability , would need  to be 
monitored.  
Corporate sector  
In 2014 Q3, corporate profitability slightly 
improved from the previous quarter especially in  
the construction sector. Meanw hile, the wholesale 
and retail  sector along with Small and Mediu m 
Enterprises (SME s) had  yet to fully benefit from 
economic recovery. Nonetheless, overall stability 
of the corporate sector was well maintained  with 
corporate debt burden and liquidity stabilizing  
close to their long -term average s.  
In 2014 Q3, corporate profitability slightly 
improved from the previous quarter as reflected in 
an increase in Net Profit Margin ( NPM) to 4.7 
percent. (Chart 3.20 ) In particular, income recognition  
on backlog orders in the construction sector 
provided a positive impact on debt burden and 
debt servicing ability . On the contrary, sales in the 
real estate sector recovered  slowly  (Chart 3.21)

homes.  
Though consumer confidence began to 
pick up after the political situation was resolved, 
some sectors did not fully benefit from 
improvement in outlook  yet. F or instance, sales of 
durable goods in the  retail sector  still contracted 
from the previous quarter as consumers continued 
to be cautious in their spending. As a result, some  
negative  effect s on corporate  profitability and debt 
servicing ability  could be experienced . (Chart 
3.22)  In addition,  the low economic growth had 
some negative impact on SMEs’ debt servicing 
ability as reflected by an increase in delinquency 
and NPL ratio from 2.0 percent at the end of 2014 
Q2 to 2.3  in 2014 Q3. However, ov erall debt and 
corporate liquidity was well maintained  where by 
the Debt to Equity (D/E) Ratio and the Current 
Ratio (CR) in 2014 Q3 registered at 0.8 and 1.5, 
respectively, staying close to their 10 -year averages . 
Looking ahead, factors which could impact 
corporate profitability included  the continuity of 
economic recovery and in come from foreign 
tourists during  high-season at the end of the year 
which could somewhat facilitate recovery in sales 
of service -related sectors.  
Real estate sector  
Real estate markets in Bangkok and its 
vicinities recovered continually . However,  activities 
were  rather limited to the middle -income buyer  
group . As a result, developers did not push for  
new sales openings. This  observation  was due to  
high indebtedness of  some  households and 
maintenance of high credit standards by commercial  
bank s. There were  some signs of deterioration in 
mortgage loan quality which would be monitored  Percentage change from the previous quarter

in the periods ahead.  
Real estate act ivities pick ed up continually 
both in terms of demand and supply. The unit 
reservation rate increase d from 27.9 percent in 
2014 Q3 to 34.5 percent in October 2014 , owing 
to reservation of condominiums in the higher than 
5 million baht  per unit  category . This development 
reflected that purchasing power of  middle -income 
earners’ was still maintained and  was in line with 
increases  in the number  of new mortgage 
approvals  and new launches  from the previous 
quarter,  especially for condominiums . (Chart 3.23)  
Nonetheless,  the fragil e economy still had some 
negative  impact s on income  and purchasing 
decisions of low-income buyers.   
The high level of household debt as a 
result of previous debt accumulation caused 
household’s debt servicing ability to slightly 
deteriorate as reflected by an increase in the  NPL 
ratio and  the delinquency ratio of mortgage loans 
in 2014 Q3. (Chart 3.24)  
However, there was still no clear sign of 
real estate speculation. The number  of borrowers 
holding more than one  property in 2014 Q3 
remained close to the end of 2013. (Chart 3.25)  
This was due to buyers’  cautious  spending  
behavior and  financial institutions’ high credit 
standard s as reflected by the Debt Service 
Coverage Ratio (DSCR) in October 2014 which 
stood at 4.4 times , stabilizing  close to its 5 -year 
historical average. (Chart 3.26)  
In the periods ahead, the real estate 
sector was poised to recover  continually  in tandem 
with the eco nomy and financial institutions’ 
expectation of higher  demand for mortgage loan s.

power and debt servicing ability still needed to be 
monitored  in the periods ahead . 
Fiscal sector  
Stability of the fiscal sector continued to be 
sound  overall . The high level of treasury balance 
helped cushion the impact of lower -than-targeted 
revenue collection. Meanwhile, the ratio of public 
debt to GDP increased slightly but was not of 
much concern.  
Stability of the fiscal sector continued to be 
sound overa ll, as reflected by 1) the high level of 
treasury balance  which  helped cushion the impact 
of lower -than-targeted revenue collection. At the 
end of September 2014, treasury balance stood at 
496 billion baht , lower than the same perio d last 
year of 605 billi on ba ht. This is  partly as a result of 
the need to use the funds to compensate revenue 
collection in fiscal year 2014 which was 
approximately 0.2 trillion  baht below target due to 
the economic  slowdown and the postponement in 
diesel oil tax increase. Despite these factors, 
treasury balance remained high enough to provide 
reserve for the government if needed ; and 2) t he 
ratio of public debt to GDP  which  increased 
slightly from 46.8 pe rcent in Ju ly 2014 to 47.2 
percent in September 2014. (Chart 3.2 7) 
Nonetheless, this level of public debt was still well 
below  the fiscal sustainability threshold of 60 
percent of GDP . In this regard, t he increase in 
debt was due to  borrowings to finance the budget 
deficit, loans under the Emergency Decree on 
Investment  for Water Resource M anagement and 
Future D evelopment, B.E. 2555 (2012), urban 
railway project, and Thai baht borrowings to

 56 Monetary Policy Report  December 2014  Impact of the Japanese yen ’s depreciation on the Thai economy  
The Japanese yen  has been depreciating  since 2013 , after the government announced the 
Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) measures. The depreciation became more 
pronounced after  the Bank of Japan  announce d an increase in QQE and the resolution of parliament 
in October 2014.1/ 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
However, the weak yen has not yield ed much benefit to the Japanese economy. This 
observation is due to a structural shift in Japan’s exports such that it  has beco me more dependent on 
imports of fuel and energy products for electricity production , following the nuclear incident  in 2011.2/ 
(Table  1) Looking ahead, it is assessed that the QQE would cause the Japanese yen  to continue 
depreciating for the next two years. Moreover, once the impact of other economic stimulus measures 
substantiate and various structural problems are resolved, the Japanese economy would gradually 
recover, resulting in some appreciation in the Japanese yen . 
The Japanese yen ’s depreciation would affect the Thai economy through the following 
channels . 
1. Trade  channel    
In the short -term, Thai exports to Japan are likely to decrease somewhat , due to price  
bargaining by Japanese importers. However, in the long -term, Thailand should benefit from the 
weakening Japanese yen  in the same way as  most Asian countries.  
 1.1 Thai merchandise exports that are parts of Japan’s supply chain s would increase 
though export value may decrease in the short -term due to bargaining by Japanese firms. 
Previous studies show that exchange rate movements d id not significantly affect Thai export 
volume s as the majority of Thailand’s export s to Japan inclu de necessary goods, raw materials 
and intermediate goods.3/ (Chart 1) However, exporters may face some price bargaining by Japanese 
firms, particularly for labor -intensive goods and commodities with intense competition. Nonetheless, the 
                                                             
1/ The Japanese yen depreciated by 21.9 percent from the beginning of 2013 and 12.1 percent year to dat e. 
2/ However, a decline in global oil prices would help offset the impact of the Japanese yen’s depreciat ion such 
that the trade balance would not decrease  by much.  
3/ Most Asian countries export necessary goods to Japan. The Japanese yen’s depreciation would therefor e 
have a minimal impact on export volume of these goods, particularly fuel and energy products from 
Indonesia, Malaysia and South Korea , along with food products  from Thailand.  Table 1 Japan’s exchan ge rate and trade balance

turn, benefit Thai exports that ar e parts of Japan’s supply chains  such as automobile parts. (Chart 2)  
Meanwhile, the benefits on Thai exports that are parts of Japan’s supply chain for intermediate goods  
such as electronic goods would be limited to those used in production of Japan’s major export goods.  
Moreover, the indirect impact arising from Thailand’s exports to Japan’s competitors such as South 
Korea and Taiwan whi ch could stand to lose some price competitiveness, was not expected to be 
significant because Thailand is not a major part of the two countries’ supply chains unlike Malaysia  and 
Vietnam. Overall, it is expected that Thailand would benefit from the Japanes e yen ’s depreciation 
through improvement in Japan’s exports and the gain would be more than  for neighboring economies.  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1.2 Costs of imports from Japan , particularly automobile parts and metal products,  would 
decline when converted to Thai baht terms . Nonetheless, the Japanese yen’s depreciation would 
not cause import volume from Japan to rise significantly as import volume is mainly determined by 
domestic demand and Thailand’s automobile exports. The observation is in agreement with a 
survey of businesses which found that most imports  from Japan  are high tech raw materials and 
capital goods that Thailand cannot produce. Meanwhile, price is not a major  issue for intra -group 
trade , and import product specifications are usually set by pare nt companies in Japan, for example 
metal sheets and engines. Moreover, businesses that rely on domestic raw materials are likely to 
continue this practice in the periods ahead, especially the automobile industry, given the 
satisfactory quality and availabi lity of domestic inputs . 
2. Trade  in services  and income  channel  
 Income from Japanese tourists may decline in the short -term. As recovery in the Japanese 
economy firms up, it can be expected that this part of tourist income would improve. Since the 
beginning of 2014, the domestic political uncertainty has led to a decline in the number of Japanese  
tourists . (Chart 3)  Nonetheless, the number of Japanese tourists has begu n to pick up after the 
political problem was resolved as Thailand continues  to be Japan’s favorite tourist destination. 
However, the Japanese yen’s depreciation may cause tourists to shorten the period of stay or cut 
back on travel spending. In the long -term when Japan’s economy improve s, it can be expected that 
tourist income would als o pick up.  
 Regarding the expenditure  of Thai tourists travelling to Japa n, apart from the visa waiver that 
became effective since July 2013 and the increase in low -cost airlines’ flights to Japan, the Japanese 
yen’s depreciation would likely stimulate Tha i people to travel to Japan. However, income continued 0.5%

travelling to Japan slowed down in line with the declining domestic economy even though the 
Japanese  yen was depreciating during the same period. Thus, should the Thai economy pick up and 
the Japanese yen continue to depreciate, the number of Thai tourists travelling  to Japan would likely 
increase.  
Concerning profit and dividend  
repatriation by Japanese subsidiaries , 
the Japanese yen’s depreciation has 
induced greater flows of funds as 
businesses can receive higher amount 
in Japanese yen  terms. However, if 
the Japanese subsidiaries have plans  
to expand invest ment  in Thailand, 
they may only send some part  of the 
profit home and reinvest the rest 
according to their plans.   
 
 
 
 
3. International  capital  flows and external  debt channel  
The Japanese yen’s depreciation is not a key consideration in Japan’s Foreign Direct 
Investment  (FDI).  Rather, decisions are based on the fact that Japan has many domestic structural 
impediments namely high labor costs which stem from labor shortage and the aging society. 
Thailand possess es sound  economic fundamentals, necessary infrastructures and financial 
services  and locates in a strategic 
location , making it a suitable 
production  base and distribution 
hub for Japanese exports to Asia. 
In addition, Japan is also expanding  
its financial service s into the region.  
FDI in Thailand has mainly come 
from Japan  (Chart 4) , especially for  
the automobile and electronics 
industries. Thus , the Japanese yen’s  
depreciation does not have a large 
effect on the amount of FDI. 
Nonetheless, it may have  an effect 
on the timing of capital flows. 
Meanwhile , Thai Direct Investment 
(TDI) to Japan has been low in the 
past due to lack of business opportunities. Most TDI has been in a form of intra -group trade 
finance which varies according to the amount of int ra-group trade.  
Portfolio  investment between Thailand and Japan is also marginally affected given the 
limited role of Japanese investors in domestic securities investment as they prefer lower -risk 
financial assets of major economies. Thais’ investment in Japanese securities is also limited

improvement in Japan’s economy and capital market, Thais’ investment in Japanese securities 
may rise.  
The Japanese yen’s depreciation  does not significantly reduce Thai external debt given 
the small proportion of Japanese yen denominated debt. In 2014 Q3, this proportion totaled only 
6.5 percent of Thailand’s total external debt. In addition, as most debtors have already  hedged 
against foreign exchange risk, the Japanese yen’s depreciation would not  render  much . 
In summary, the Japanese yen’s depreciation would not significantly benefit Japan’s 
economy due to a structural shift in its exports and higher  degree of  energy i mports. In the short -
term, some negative impact on the Thai economy would be experienced mainly  through trade and 
tourism. In this connection, Thailand’s current account deficit with Japan would enlarge, especially  
through tourist income. Meanwhile, the ef fects on foreign investment would be minimal as FDI  
considerations are mainly based on long -term fundamentals while there is limited portfolio  
investment between Thailand and Japan. In the long -term, if the Japanese yen’s depreciation is 
significant enough  to stimulate Japan’s exports and economic growth, benefits would also fall on 
Thailand which plays a key part in Japan’s supply chains. (Table 2)
