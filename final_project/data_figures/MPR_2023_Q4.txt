4/62Executive Summary
Global economy
Trading partners’ economies are projected to expand by 2.8% in 2023, 
2.6% in 2024, and 2.7% in 2025. The US economy would be driven by private 
consumption. Meanwhile, China and Japan are expected to see stronger growth in 2024 
due to new stimulus measures from their governments. Overall, the global economic 
recovery is underway with more balanced growth across the manufacturing and services 
sectors. In particular, the manufacturing sector is expected to recover in line with the 
upturn in the global electronic cycle in 2024. Nonetheless, there remain risks to the 
global economic outlook namely the cumulative impact of monetary tightening by 
major central banks, a sharper -than-expected downturn in global trade due to weak 
demand from China, and protracted geopolitical tensions . 
The Thai economy
The Thai economy continues to recover with growth projected to be 
2.4% in 2023, 3.2% in 2024, and 3.1% in 2025. For 2023, the economic recovery has 
been driven by a strong expansion in private consumption especially services spending, 
as well as improvements in employment and labor income. Meanwhile, the tourism 
sector recovery has been slower than expected due to a slow recovery in foreign tourist 
arrivals from China (Box 1: The slow recovery of foreign tourist arrivals from China 
and implications for the tourism sector ). Merchandise exports recovery in 2023 has 
been slower than expected partly due to the economic slowdown in China and a 
nascent recovery in the global electronic cycle. Looking ahead, the Thai economy is 
expected to see more balanced growth given continued recovery in the tourism sectoralongside the turnaround in merchandise exports as external demand picks up with 
trading partners’ growth and an upturn in the global electronic cycle (Box 2: Spillover 
effects from the global economy to Thai merchandise exports ). However, there is 
a risk that Thai exports would not fully benefit from the global economic recovery in 
part due to structural impediments and lower competitiveness of Thailand’s exports 
sector. In addition, there remains the need to monitor the implementation of 
government measures, especially the digital wallet scheme  which remains unclear in 
detail. Taking into account the impact of the digital wallet scheme, Thailand’s GDP 
growth would instead be 3.8% in 2024 and 2.8% in 2025 (Box 3: Macroeconomic 
forecast under the impact of the digital wallet scheme).
Inflation
Headline inflation is expected to be within the target range, averaging 1.3% 
in 2023, 2.0% in 2024, and 1.9% in 2025. If the impact of the digital wallet scheme is 
taken into account, headline inflation would instead be 2.2% in 2024 and 2.0% in 2025. 
The lower headline inflation in 2023 owes to a high base in the previous year and 
temporary factors such as government energy price subsidies and lower -than-expected 
raw food prices. Meanwhile, core inflation is expected to be largely stable, 
averaging 1.3% in 2023, 1.2% in 2024, and 1.3% in 2025. There remains the need to 
monitor the risks of potentially higher food prices due to El Niño and the increase in 
global energy prices from the Middle East conflicts. Assessment of the macroeconomic outlook
5/62Executive Summary
Financial conditions and financial stability
Overall financial conditions have tightened somewhat. Private sector 
funding costs have increased as commercial banks’ interest rates rose in tandem 
with the policy rate hike on 27 September 2023. Long -term government bond 
yields fell in line with the decline in US Treasury yields due to market expectations 
that the Fed might not be able to keep its policy rate high for as long as previously 
anticipated. Credit spreads remained largely unchanged from the previous quarter. 
In terms of financing volume, overall private credit growth slowed down in Q3/2023 
due to debt repayments after having accelerated during the COVID -19 pandemic, 
and the expiry of various financial assistance measures. However, business loan 
growth is expected to pick up together with the recovery in economic activities 
going forward. On exchange rates, the baht against the U.S. dollar depreciated 
on average from the previous quarter driven mainly by market expectations 
regarding the Fed’s monetary policy outlook. 
The overall financial system remains resilient with commercial banks 
maintaining high levels of capital and loan loss provision. There is a need to 
continue monitoring credit quality for some SMEs and households with impaired 
debt serviceability, higher debt burden, and slower income recovery (Box 4: 
Thailand’s household debt situation and financial vulnerability ). The MPC 
supports the continuation of debt restructuring measures as well as targeted measures 
and sustainable debt resolution for vulnerable groups, particularly responsible 
lending measures. Monetary Policy Decisions in the Fourth Quarter of 2023
At the meeting on 29 November 2023, the MPC voted unanimously to maintain 
the policy rate at 2.50%
The MPC deemed the overall economic recovery to be intact despite the absence of 
a broad -based recovery in 2023 from the slow recovery of merchandise exports and 
exports -related manufacturing sectors. However, the economy is expected to see more balanced 
growth in 2024 and 2025 driven by domestic demand, tourism, and the recovery in exports. 
Nonetheless, there remains the need to monitor the risk that Thai exports might not fully benefit 
from the global economic recovery and the upturn in the global electronic cycle due to 
Thailand’s various structural impediments. Inflation is expected to stabilize within the target 
range. Headline inflation in 2023 declined due to a high base in the previous year and temporary 
factors, but should increase in 2024 and 2025 due to the economic recovery and supply -side 
pressures from El Niño.
The MPC deems the current policy rate to be appropriate given the current 
contexts where the economy is gradually recovering towards its potential. The current 
policy rate would also help sustain inflation within the target range, strengthen 
macroeconomic and financial stability over the long term, guard against the buildup of 
financial imbalances, and preserve policy space as an insurance against uncertain 
outlook. However, the macroeconomic outlook remains highly uncertain with both 
upside and downside risks stemming from (1) the global economic recovery; (2) the impact 
of conflicts in the Middle East; (3) the severity of El Niño; and (4) the impact of government 
measures such as the digital wallet scheme and living costs subsidies. The MPC would take 
into account growth and inflation outlook as well as associated risks in deliberating 
monetary policy going forward.

Global Economy: Key Issues
7/62Global economy
The global economy would continue to recover in 2023. The US economy continued to expand despite high inflation 
and high policy rate, while China is expected to see improving growth going forward. 
Overall, the recovery is likely to be more balanced across the manufacturing and services sectors.
Economic activities in the services sector slowed down after having accelerated 
earlier. Meanwhile, there are signs that activities in the manufacturing sector are 
gradually improving. Looking ahead, the recovery is likely to be more balanced 
across the services and manufacturing sectors. The services sector would still drive 
growth momentum for some countries like the US. On the other hand, the manufacturing 
sector would recover on the back of anticipated upturn in the global electronic cycle 
within next year.

9/62Global economy
Inflation in many countries has declined overall with most central banks placing a hold on their policy rate hikes.
The Federal Reserve (Fed) maintained its policy rate at 5.25 -5.50% at the FOMC Meeting 
on 1 Nov 2023. The decision was underpinned by slowing labor market conditions. In this 
regard, the BOT revised down its assumptions for the federal funds rate by 25 bps 
throughout the forecast period. It is expected that the Fed’s tightening cycle is now over, 
and that the high policy rate would be maintained throughout the first half of 2024 before 
the Fed starts to cut the policy rate again in the latter half of the year. 
The European Central Bank ( ECB) maintained its policy rate at 4.0% at the Governing 
Council Meeting on 26 Oct 2023. Economic growth in the euro area has been slowing down 
due to effects of monetary tightening as reflected in the slowdown in both credit demand 
and labor market conditions. The ECB would continue its asset purchases under the 
Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) throughout 2024. Looking ahead, it is 
expected that the ECB would gradually cut its policy rate in the latter half of 2024. 
Most Asian central banks have stopped raising their policy rates to evaluate the monetary 
policy transmission from earlier rate hikes. This was also due to falling headline inflation, 
although core inflation for some countries remained high. Nevertheless, the Bangko Sentral 
ng Pilipinas and Bank Indonesia have raised their policy rates by one additional hike to 
address inflation and currency depreciation, which were unexpected by the market.

Trading partners’ growth forecast for 2023 is revised up slightly on account of stronger -than-expected Q3/2023 
economic outturns for US and China. Trading partner economies are expected to see stronger growth in 2024
across all countries except the euro area. 
Trading partners’ growth forecast for 2023 is revised up slightly on account of 
stronger -than-expected growth outturns in Q3/2023 for US and China. The US 
economy has continuously been driven by a strong expansion in private 
consumption, while China’s stronger -than-expected growth was driven by exports.
Trading partners’ growth would be stronger in 2024 across all countries except the 
euro area. China and Japan would see stronger growth due to new stimulus measures 
from their governments. Meanwhile, the US economy would still be driven by private 
consumption and Asia’s economies would be uplifted by stronger demand from their 
trading partners.
Trading partner economies in 2025 are expected to expand further, given that 
each countries will be advancing towards their potential output levels.

Downside risks:  Global economic recovery might be slower than expected due to
(1) The cumulative impact of monetary tightening, both from recent rate hikes and additional rate hikes as the inflation outlook faces 
risks of El Niño being more severe than expected. 
(2) A slowdown in global trade especially if demand from China is weaker than expected.
(3) Geopolitical tensions especially if tensions between US and China escalate further, and if the conflicts between China -Taiwan, 
Russia -Ukraine, and Israel -Hamas become prolonged and more severe than expected. 
Upside risks:  Asia’s economic growth might be stronger than expected due to 
(1) Increased international tourism resulting in a strong recovery in the services sector, especially the return of Chinese tourists to countries 
within the region
(2) Stronger -than-expected economic growth for China driven by government stimulus measures, resulting in stronger Asian exports growth
(3) More stimulus measures being rolled out than previously expected in China and JapanRisks to trading partners’ growth outlook in 2024 remain tilted to the downside 
due to cumulative impact of monetary policy tightening and potentially slower recovery in global trade.  
12/62The Thai economy
The Thai Economy: Key Issues
External demand is recovering despite a 
slower -than-expected recovery in tourism and 
merchandise exports in 2023. These are partly 
due to the economic slowdown in China and a 
nascent recovery in the global electronic cycle. 
External demand would pick up in 2024 in line 
with the turnaround in merchandise exports and 
a continued recovery in the tourism sector.Domestic demand has continued to expand. 
Strong private consumption growth is driven 
by spending in services, in line with the 
continued recovery in labor income. Headline inflation would be within the target 
range. Headline inflation has been low in 2023 
due to temporary factors but is expected to 
be higher in the period ahead. Core inflation 
would also increase in 2024. Upside risks to 
inflation stem from potentially higher food 
and energy prices. 
13/62The Thai economy
External demand: foreign tourist  arrivals would continue to increase but still be lower than the previous assessment 
due to a slow recovery in the number of Chinese tourists.
•Foreign tourist arrivals forecast is revised down to 28.3 million persons in 
2023 and 34.5 million persons in 2024 on account of lower -than-expected 
outturns for the number of Chinese tourists  (Box 1: The slow recovery of 
foreign tourist arrivals from China and implications for the tourism sector ). 
However, looking ahead, foreign tourist arrivals (excl. Chinese tourists) are 
expected to strongly recover in line with the past trends. Moreover, foreign 
tourist arrivals would reap the benefits from new visa exemptions (visa free) 
for tourists from India, Taiwan, and Kazakhstan. 
•Foreign tourist arrivals in 2025 are projected to be 39 million persons, 
reflecting a continued increase driven by momentum from the preceding years.

The Thai tourism sector has resumed its role in driving economic growth since 
Thailand’s re -opening from the pandemic and the cancellation of the Thailand Pass program 
in mid -2022. As of October 2023, foreign tourist arrivals totaled 23.2 million persons (68% of 
2019 value) and generated over 980 billion baht in revenue1/. However, the recovery in the 
number of foreign tourists is clearly uneven across different nationalities . For most 
nationalities, the recovery has been strong and in line with past trends (Chart 1). For Chinese 
tourists, which used to be the Thailand’s largest tourist arrivals, totaled only 2.9 million 
persons year -to-date (29% of pre -COVID levels). Although the Chinese government already 
lifted foreign travel restrictions for its citizens and permitted group tours to Thailand since 
early 2023, the recovery in the number of Chinese tourists has been slower -than-expected. 
The reasons for the slow recovery can be summarized as follow:
(1)The Chinese government’s post -COVID policies were geared towards bolstering the 
economic recovery by boosting domestic consumption spending and domestic 
tourism. This included arranging concerts and film festivals, cancelling tourism fees, 
and approving additional public holidays. Moreover, private sector businesses focus on 
promoting domestic travel. Thus, China’s domestic tourism, measured by airline seat 
capacity, increased by 15% from pre -COVID levels in the recent Golden Week 
(29 Sep –7 Oct 2023)

This contrasts with China’s international travel, which is 43% lower than pre -COVID levels 
(Chart 2, LHS ). Looking ahead, China’s stimulus policies, which have crowded out China’s 
international travel, are expected to hamper the tourism recovery in various countries, 
especially in Thailand where the tourism sector has been highly dependent on Chinese 
tourists. 
(2) Chinese tourist s’ safety concerns regarding tourism in Thailand. This is 
reflected in the Chinese Traveler Sentiment Survey2/, which found that the number of 
Chinese tourists concerned about traveling to Thailand grew from 28% in 2022 to 51% in 
2023. This is partly due to the recent Chinese films and social media that portrayed the 
safety concerns in traveling to Thailand as well as some ASEAN countries. As a result, the 
number of Chinese tourists traveling to Thailand recovered slowly, while it continued 
recovering in Europe, Japan, Korea, and Singapore (Chart 2, RHS). Therefore it is 
imperative for relevant agencies in Thailand to work closely together to ensure that 
tourists would travel safely throughout their stay in order to regain the confidence of 
Chinese travelers.

The aforementioned negative factors limited the positive effects of the visa 
exemptions given to Chinese tourists. Meanwhile, the Chinese government policy 
direction resulted in a structural change in tourism. As such, the number of Chinese 
tourist arrivals would take time to recover in the period ahead. The projected number 
of Chinese tourists is therefore revised down to 3.5 million persons, 6.2 million persons, 
and 7.8 million persons in 2023, 2024, and 2025, respectively (Chart 3) . However, tourists 
of other nationalities have shown considerable recovery, offsetting the decline in Chinese 
tourists to some extent. Consequently, total foreign tourist arrivals are projected to stand 
at 28.3 million persons in 2023, 34.5 million persons in 2024, and 39 million persons in 
2025.
Reinvigorating Thai tourism demand among Chinese travelers is considered 
an important challenge in the period ahead. In the near term, the relevant public and 
private sector agencies must act swiftly to restore a positive image for Thailand. This 
includes promoting Thai tourism among other foreign nationalities in terms of both the 
number of incoming travelers and spending per head, in order to mitigate the negative 
economic impacts during the period that the number of Chinese tourists is still recovering 
slowly. Over the long term, relevant agencies need to ensure the readiness of tourist 
destinations as well as domestic infrastructures to accommodate growth and enhance the

Merchandise exports would bounce back in the period ahead in line with trading partners’ growth 
and an upturn in the global electronic cycle. 
•Merchandise exports outturns in Q3/2023 were higher than expected. This 
was mainly due to higher export prices stemming from increased in fuel and 
agricultural prices. Meanwhile, exports volume was in line with expectations.
•Looking ahead, merchandise exports volume would recover on the back of 
(1) trading partners’ economic growth and improvements in manufacturing 
demand; and (2) the global electronic cycle recovery . It is expected that Thai 
exports would clearly benefit from those two factors in the first half of 2024 
(Box 2: Spillover effects from the global economy to Thai merchandise exports )
•Export prices remain high in line with global energy prices as well as an increase
in rice prices due to the decline in rice output from India. 
•Exports outlook is still subject to risks stemming from (1) trading partners’ 
economic recovery having limited positive spillovers on Thai exports due to 
structural factors; and (2) the recovery in the global electronic cycle which might 
be slower than expected.

Economic recovery among Thailand’s key trading partners is mainly driven by the 
services sector. The service -led recovery is an important factor explaining why Thai 
exports have not benefited much in the previous period. Exports from Thailand and other 
countries in the region contracted despite the economic expansion among trading partners. 
However, in the period ahead, the manufacturing sector and global trade would play 
more prominent roles in driving growth than the services sector. This is in line with the 
IMF’s view that growth in global trade volumes would turn positive in 2024. It is therefore 
assessed that such sectoral rebalancing would be a key factor underpinning Thailand’s exports 
recovery in the future. 
One of the methodology used in assessing the benefits of sectoral rebalancing 
among trading partners is employing the Inter -Country Input -Output (ICIO)1/ table to 
analyze the recovery of the manufacturing sector. It illustrates the interconnections 
between the input and output of production across countries. The analysis involves evaluating 
the positive spillover effect on Thai exports resulting from demand recovery in the 
manufacturing and services sectors of each trading partner, and comparing these effects among 
different trading partners. The findings are as follow :
(1) Demand recovery in Japan and China have the most positive spillover effects 
on Thai exports. If the final demand from Japan and China each increases by 100 U.S. dollar, 
the value of Thai merchandise exports would increase by 0.2 and 0.1 U.S. dollars, respectively. 
This is in line with the level of supply chain interconnectedness between Thailand and those 
two trading partners (Chart 1). Box 2: Spillover effects from the global economy to Thai merchandise exports

(2) An increase in d emand from the manufacturing sector has greater 
positive spillover effects on Thai merchandise exports than an increase in demand 
from the services sector. This finding is consistent for demand from all of Thailand’s key 
trading partners. If trading partners’ final demand in the manufacturing sector increases by 
100 U.S. dollar, the value of Thai merchandise exports would increase by 0.1 -0.4 U.S. 
dollar. Meanwhile, if the final demand in the services sector of a trading partner increases 
by 100 U.S. dollar, it results in only a 0.1 U.S. dollar increase in the Thai merchandise 
exports (Chart 2). The industries that benefit the most from increased final demand in 
the manufacturing sector are electronics, electrical appliances, and chemical and 
petrochemical products, respectively. However, the current structure of Thai exports has 
changed from the past. In particular, exports of electronics are no longer driven by 
demand for hard disk drives resulting from changing consumer behavior. Additionally, 
exports of chemical and petrochemical products have been affected by China’s policy 
changes, focusing on domestic production and relying less on imported inputs from 
abroad. Given these structural changes, the positive spillover effects for some goods 
could be less than the assessment based on the ICIO table. Box 2: Spillover effects from the global economy to Thai merchandise exports

The second methodology, which could reflect the current trade structure 
better, involves using the Global Vector Autoregression model (GVAR)2/ to assess 
the spillover effects of the global economy on Thai exports. The assessment 
examines the spillover effects in 3 main channels: (1) trade channel: GDP, merchandise
exports, and merchandise imports; (2) financial channel: short-term interest rate, 
long-term interest rate, exchange rates, and inflation; and (3) global factor: oil prices. 
The assessment is conducted in 2 steps: (1) evaluate the impact of the main 
domestic variables (𝒙𝒊𝒕) and global variables ( 𝒙𝒊𝒕∗)3/ through the VAR  model 
(VARX4/) for each country  whereby the impact from global factors on the Thai 
economy would be weighed by the bilateral trade weight5/; and (2) evaluate both the 
direct and indirect impacts on all countries through the GVAR6/ model, which 
integrates each country’s individual VAR model into one single model for the global 
economy linked by global factors. In addition, the oil price in current period is based 
on the immediately preceding value7/.Box 2: Spillover effects from the global economy to Thai merchandise exports

21/62The Thai economy
The assessment based on the GVAR model found that trading partners’ 
economic recovery would have more positive spillover effects on Thai exports than 
in the past. Comparing the spillover effects under the trade patterns in 2012 and 2022, 
the spillover effects on Thai exports in one year time would be 1.2% using 2012 trade 
structure and 1.9% using 2022 trade structure (equivalent to an average quarterly 
recovery of 0.5% in 2024 and 0.6% in 2025). The given results are under the assumptions 
that trading partners, especially the US, China, Japan, and EU would recover in line with 
the assumptions for trading partners’ growth; whereby the US and China would expand, 
EU would remain stable, and Japan would slightly contract8/ in the latter half of 2023. 
These results can be explained by (1) increased role of China and the US in global trade 
over the past 10 years; and (2) second -round effects through China’s and the US’s key 
trading partners given that Thailand’s key trading partners are more interconnected with 
China and the US. Furthermore, it is assessed that the source of shock in the period 
ahead is expected to originate from China’s economic  recovery (Chart 3)Box 2: Spillover effects from the global economy to Thai merchandise exports
8/ The assumption for trading partners’ growth used as a shock is that the US, China, Japan, and EU 
economies would grow  at the same rate as the previous quarter at 0.6%, 0.9%, -0.2%, and 0.0% 
QoQ s.a., respectively. The shock also takes place at the same time period of t=0.

When considering the channels of transmission, the trade channels, 
especially exports and imports by G3 economies and China, are found to be the 
most significant for Thai exports. For the financial channels, the renminbi and the US 
dollar would become more significant for Thai exports in the next 4 quarters. The 
spillover effects on Thai exports from other countries beside the 4 mentioned beforehand 
are quite limited (Chart 4).
In summary, it is expected that Thai merchandise exports would benefit 
from increasing demand in the manufacturing sector of trading partners as well as a 
turnaround in global trade. The benefits would be proportionate to Thailand’s 
increased trade ties with China and the US. Nevertheless, there remain risks that must be 
monitored namely structural change in Thai exports due to the loss of competitiveness 
and the impact of geopolitical tensions, such as retaliation measures and trade barriers.Box 2: Spillover effects from the global economy to Thai merchandise exports

Export of 
servicesRevised down partly on account of lower tourist arrivals and tourism income as well as other services income such as transportation 
costs, and other business services. Foreign tourist arrivals in 2023 are expected to be 28.3 million persons. Foreign tourist arrivals would 
continue to recover in 2024 and 2025 with the number of tourists increasing to 34.5 million persons in 2024 and 39.0 million persons in 2025.  
While the recovery in the number of Chinese tourists would be slow, tourists from other countries would recover strongly. Tou rism income is 
revised down given that tourists of other nationalities are short -haul travelers with lower spending per head compared to Chines e tourists. 
Merchandise 
exports 
(value)Merchandise exports contract less than previously expected on account of better -than-expected economic outturns among trading 
partners, especially the US and China. Merchandise exports growth would turn positive in 2024 and 2025 driven by an upturn in the 
global electronic cycle in 2024  as well as trading partners’ economic recovery, especially in the manufacturing sector. This would lead 
to higher global trade volume and thus positive spillovers to Thai exports.
Private 
consumptionPrivate consumption would continue to expand, particularly in the services sector for hotels and restaurants. This aligns with the 
labor market recovery, as reflected by the number of those insured under Section 33 of the Social Security Act, working hours , and labor 
income, notably for those working in tourism -related sectors. Private consumption is expected to continue expanding in 2024 and 
2025, driven by Thailand’s economic recovery which would still be supported by improvements in employment, labor income, and 
consumer confidence.
Private 
investmentPrivate investment outturns were higher -than-expected in Q3 -2023. Private investment  is expected to continue expanding in 
2024 and 2025, supported by the gradual recovery in merchandise exports in 2024 and a continued expansion in domestic demand. 
Moreover, there will be investments in new industries under the Board of Investment’s promotion scheme as well as in public -private 
partnership (PPP) projects, such as the high -speed railways connecting the 3 airports and the MRT Orange Line which are expected to 
commence in 2024.Summary of economic forecasts

Headline inflation  outturns in Q4 -2023 were low due to the government’s living cost subsidies and a high base for 
vegetable prices. However, headline inflation is expected to gradually rise in 2024 due to supply -side pressures.
•Headline inflation would remain low throughout the rest of 2023. 
This is due to the government subsidies for electricity bills and diesel 
prices, and a high base for vegetable prices from the previous year. 
Headline inflation is expected to gradually rise in 2024 ,on account of 
higher energy and raw food prices, and would slightly decline in 2025. 
Overall, inflation is expected to move within the target range in 2024 
and 2025.
•Core inflation is expected to be higher in 2024 and 2025 compared 
to Q4 -2023, but would remain below the levels seen in 2022 due to

•Trading partners’ growth for 2023 is revised up from the previous assessment on account 
of better -than-expected outturns, especially for US and China. For 2024 and 2025, trading 
partners’ growth would be driven by the US where private consumption is expected to 
strongly expand, as well as China and Japan which would benefit from additional 
government stimulus measures.
•The federal funds rate is expected to be at 5.25 -5.50% throughout  the remainder of 
2023. It is expected that the Fed would start to cut the federal funds rate from September 
2024 onwards as inflationary pressure gradually declines.
•Regional currencies ( excluding the Chinese yuan) would depreciate in the latter half of 
2023 on account of weaker -than-expected economic growth in Asia. Looking ahead, 
regional currencies are expected to appreciate in line with the economic recovery of 
regional economies.
•Dubai crude oil prices in 2023 are revised down from the previous projection on account 
of lower -than-expected oil price outturns. In the period ahead, crude oil prices are 
expected to increase due to tighter market conditions from the expansion in the global 
economy and a slowdown in global crude oil output. 
•Farm income (excluding government measures) in 2023 would contract mainly on 
account of lower  palm oil, rubber, and pork prices. For 2024, farm income would see 
positive growth from higher agricultural prices due to the impact of El Niño as well as the 
recovery in global demand. Farm income is expected to be largely stable in 2025. 
•Public spending at current prices for 2023 is revised down on account of lower -than-

Dubai crude oil prices assumption for 2023 is revised down from 83 to 82 U.S. dollar 
per barrel on account of lower -than-expected price outturns. It is also expected that 
the Israel -Hamas conflict would have limited impact on oil prices . The conflict would 
result in oil price increases for only a short period because it would not impact oil 
production infrastructures. However, upside risks to oil prices have increased from the risk 
that the conflict could become widespread, impacting oil production and oil transport. 
For 2024, the assumption remains unchanged whereby crude oil prices would be 
higher than current levels due to a tightening in the oil market from the expansion in 
the global economy and the slowdown in crude oil production. 
Risks to the outlook for Dubai crude oil prices are tilted to the upside:
•Upside risks:  Geopolitical tensions such as the Israel -Hamas and Russia -Ukraine 
conflicts could escalate further / become more widespread / prolonged than expected , 
and oil production cuts by OPEC+ that could last longer or drop sharper than 
expected.
•Downside risks:  Uncertainties in the global economy. The global economic 
recovery could be slower than expected and oil production in Venezuela could 
ramp up quickly after the US relaxes sanctions.Dubai crude oil prices assumption for 2023 is revised down but is unchanged for 2024 due to lower -than-expected price 
outturns. It is also expected that the Israel -Hamas conflict would have limited impact on oil prices.

Box 3: Macroeconomic forecast under the impact of the digital wallet scheme
Macroeconomic forecasts for 2024 is subject to uncertainties related to the 
10,000 baht digital wallet scheme which would have significant implications for the 
assessment of both growth and inflation outlooks. In this regard, the Monetary Policy 
Committee (MPC) agreed that it would be appropriate to publish 2 separate forecast 
scenarios: one including and one excluding the impact of the digital wallet scheme. 
This approach would provide a clearer explanation of the macroeconomic outlook. 
Additionally, it allows the comparison with other economic agency forecasts, which do 
not include the impact of the digital wallet scheme, and with the previous forecasts in 
the Monetary Policy Report Q3 -2023, which has already included the impact of the 
digital wallet scheme. The key differences between the previous and latest 
projections, accounted for the impact of the digital wallet scheme, are (1) the 
slowdown in export of services; and (2) changes in the digital wallet scheme details . 
Latest developments pertaining to the digital wallet scheme
On 10 November 2023, the government announced the digital wallet 
scheme details , which can be summarized  as follow: (1) target group: narrowed 
down from Thai citizens aged 16 and over (56 million persons) to those with a monthly 
salary below 70,000 baht and bank deposits not exceeding 500,000 baht (50 millionpersons); (2) total amount: budgetary allocation is reduced from 560 billion baht to 
500 billion baht; (3) scope of use: the coverage area in which funds from the digital 
wallet scheme can be used is changed from a 4 -kilometer radius to the district of the 
person’s residential address as indicated on their citizen ID; (4) type of goods and 
merchants: funds from the digital wallet scheme cannot be used to pay for online 
purchases, alcoholic beverages, cigarettes, fuel, or to repay debt. Moreover, merchants 
must be registered in the tax system to be eligible to convert their revenue into cash; 
and (5) source of fund: the government will issue a new legal Act permitting public 
borrowing to finance the scheme, subject to approval by the parliament.  
The MPC assessed that the approval process for the new Act would take 
some time and thus the economic benefits from the digital wallet scheme would 
not materialize until the latter half of 2024, as opposed to the first half of the year 
as previously expected. Empirical analysis also found that the fiscal multiplier of direct 
transfers is typically lower than direct government consumption or investment, which 
also depends on the recipient groups, eligibility, and prevailing economic conditions. 
All of which would affect new final demand generated by the transfers. Furthermore, 
an assessment of the economic impact would also depend on the aggregate amount 
and the timing of implementation as the stimulus effects would be front -loaded and

Box 3: Macroeconomic forecast under the impact of the digital wallet scheme
Comparing the previous and latest forecasts:
To compare the forecast in Monetary Policy Report Q3 -23 with the forecast 
in Monetary Policy Report Q4 -23, the scenario with the impact of digital wallet 
scheme must be used. Thailand’s GDP growth for 2024 was projected at 4.4% in 
the previous assessment, compared to 3.8% in the latest assessment. The difference is 
due to (1) a slowdown in exports of services because of lower tourism receipt and 
income of other services, such as goods and passenger transports, business and other 
general commercial services; and (2) revision of digital wallet scheme details and 
implementation date. Headline inflation in 2024 was projected to be 2.6% in the 
previous assessment compared to 2.2% in the latest assessment. The difference is due 
to (1)lower raw food  prices and core inflation; and (2) lower demand -pull inflationary 
pressure due to the revision of digital wallet scheme details and implementation date.
(Chart 1 and 2).temporary. In summary, the impact of  the digital wallet scheme is revised down 
from the previous assessment, but the impact on the forecasts is subject to 
changes given that the details and implementation date  of the digital wallet 
scheme remain highly uncertain.
Latest economic projections including and excluding the impact of the digital 
wallet scheme:
Latest projections from the Monetary Policy Report Q4 -23 is divided into 
2 scenarios: one including and one excluding the impact of the digital wallet 
scheme. For the scenario which includes the impact of the digital wallet scheme, 
the Thai economy is projected to grow 3.8% in 2024 before slowing down to 2.8% in 
2025. This is due to a higher base in 2024. Headline inflation is projected to be 2.2% in 
2024 and 2.0% in 2025 due to higher core inflation stemming from increasing demand 
pressures. In the other scenario which excludes the impact of the digital wallet 
scheme , the Thai economy would continue to recover and register GDP growth of 
3.2% in 2024 and 3.1% in 2025. The GDP growth difference in 2024 is 0.6 percentage 
point compared to the scenario with the digital wallet scheme. Headline inflation 
would be 2.0% in 2024 and 1.9% in 2025, lower than the scenario with the digital 
wallet scheme (Chart 1 and 2).

passed on higher financing costs through to their 
lending rates. Private credit growth remained tight as 
with the previous quarter because business loan 
growth has started to stabilize in line with the recovery 
in economic activities. The SET index declined due to 
weaker -than-expected corporate performances for 
Q3/2023 as well as uncertainties regarding government

to the exchange rate eased due to the baht’s 
depreciation driven primarily by market expectations

Commercial banks’ lending rates increased in line with recent policy rate hike.
Commercial banks’ lending and deposit rates gradually increased after the MPC raised the policy rate to 2.50% on 27 September 2023. Commercial banks 
raised both the minimum loan rate (MLR) and the minimum retail rate (MRR) throughout the normalization cycle, but raised the MRRto a lesser extent compared 
to the MLR to soften the impact on vulnerable borrowers, most of whom are subject to the MRR. Meanwhile, increased in deposit rates mostly applied to fixed 
deposits, especially long -term fixed deposits. The new loan rate (NLR) increased slightly as of September 2023. The increased in NLR was in line with the 
increased in benchmark lending rates and mostly applied to loans not exceeding 500 million baht for firms in the manufacturin g sector.

Short-term government bond yields declined due to growing investment demand for term funds, but short -term yields remained close to the policy rate. 
Meanwhile, medium -and long -term government bond yields declined in line with movements in US Treasury yields which fell due to market expectations about 
the Fed’s monetary policy outlook and alleviating concerns regarding the supply of US Treasury after a confirmation that bond issuance would be lower than 
previously expected. Credit spreads remain largely unchanged from the previous quarter, with limited impact from recent debt defaults of some corporate bonds.Financing costs in the bond market have declined. The bond market still functions normally.

In Q3-2023, large corporate loan growth (credit limit > 500 million baht) slowed down 
mainly due to debt repayments. Loans extended to export -related manufacturing businesses 
have continued to decline in line with the slowdown in exports. However, overall business 
loan growth remains positive due to borrowings by holding companies and construction 
businesses. Some large corporates continued to issue bonds to repay debts owed to 
banks, although issuances have slowed after having accelerated in the prior period. 
SMEs loan growth (credit limit ≤ 500 million baht) contracted from the same period 
last year. This was due to repayment on maturing soft loans as well as more cautious 
lending on the part of the banks. 
Overall household credit growth slowed down slightly on account of personal loans 
and mortgage loans, partly due to higher borrowing costs and living costs, and as banks 
remained cautious for auto loans given credit risks of borrowers. Meanwhile, credit card 
loan growth was largely stable from the previous quarter1/.
For Q4 -20232/ , loan demand would continue to grow in line with the economic recover y 
especially among large corporates looking to invest and make business acquisitions. 
Meanwhile, SMEs’ credit demand would be driven by the need to build up inventory 
and working capital. Household credit is expected to increase across all loan types in 
line with improving consumption spending and consumer confidence. Meanwhile, 
demand for auto loans has yet to recover due to strict terms of the lending contract. Private credit in Q3 -2023 slowed down overall.

In Q4-2023, the baht averaged 36.01 per U.S. dollar, depreciating from the average value of 35.17 baht per U.S. dollar in the previ ousquarter. The baht’s 
movement was driven mainly by market expectations about the Fed’s monetary policy outlook. The bond market saw net capital in flows in Q4-2023, whereas equity 
market experienced outflows due to weaker -than-expected Q3 -2023 corporate performances and uncertainties pertaining to governmen t measures. The nominal 
effective exchange rate (NEER) averaged at 118.76, largely unchanged from the previous quarter. This is because the baht’s movements on average was in line with

The Thai economy would continue to recover, with or without the digital wallet scheme. 
However, there remains the need to monitor risks that merchandise exports might not fully 
benefit from the global economic recovery and the upturn in the global electronic cycle

The current policy rate is appropriate for supporting long -term sustainable 
growth. However, the macroeconomic outlook remains highly uncertain with 
both upside and downside risks.  Monetary policy deliberation going forward 
must take into account growth and inflation outlook as well as associated risks.Financial system remains resilient overall. The MPC has continued to support 
debt restructuring measures as well as targeted measures and sustainable debt 
resolution for vulnerable groups, particularly responsible lending measures.The Thai economy overall continued to recover. Growth is expected to be 
more balanced in the period ahead, given the continued recovery in tourism 
and a turnaround in merchandise exports. However, there is still the risk that 
Thai exports would not benefit from the global economic recovery and the 
upturn in the global electronic cycle as previously expected. Inflation is 
projected to be within the target range. There remains the need to monitor 
risks of El Niño and the potential increase in global energy prices arising from 
the Middle East conflict. The current policy rate is appropriate for supporting long -term sustainable growth.

Box 4: Thailand’s household debt situation and financial vulnerabilities
Household debt is a longstanding problem in Thailand and pose a key 
vulnerability to the Thai economy. Latest indicators have shown that whilst household 
debt in Thailand has declined somewhat in tandem with the ongoing economic recovery, 
households continue to incur unproductive loans, which do not generate future income or 
wealth, at a high level to fund current consumption. In addition, credit quality of some 
borrowers, especially those affected by the COVID -19 pandemic, has not improved 
significantly. The aforementioned problems negatively impact Thailand’s financial stability 
and pose as an important policy challenge for safeguarding financial stability. 
The increase in household debt has led to the accumulation of financial 
vulnerabilities in Thailand for quite some time. Over the past 10 years, household debt in 
Thailand has constantly been on the rise due to several key factors (Chart 1) namely 
(1) the first -car scheme which led to a sharp increase in auto loans during 2011 -2012; (2) the 
historic flood in 2011 that resulted in higher loan demand for post -flood reparations; and 
(3) increased competition between banks in lending retail loans coupled with prolonged low 
interest rates for over 10 years. Furthermore, Thailand’s outstanding household debt was 
exacerbated by the COVID -19 pandemic in 2020 which led to the decline in economic 
activities and a sharp increase in debt -to-GDP ratio, peaking at 95.5% as of end -Q1/2021 
before gradually declining to 90.7% as of end -Q2/2023. The recent decline in debt -to-GDP 
was due to the recovery in economic activities as well as rising consumer prices (increase in 
GDP deflator).

Box 4: Thailand’s household debt situation and financial vulnerabilities
Despite having declined somewhat, the current household debt situation in 
Thailand still remains a concern. Thailand’s household debt to GDP ratio is still relatively
higher than in many other countries within the region, with the exception of South 
Korea which faced a spike in demand for mortgage loans and investment loans as 
a result of low borrowing costs (Chart 2) . 
Thailand’s high household debt is a vulnerability to both macroeconomic 
and financial stability, in addition to the financial inequality across households of 
different income levels. The Socio -Economic Survey (SES) back in 2021 reveals that 
low-income households (bottom 20%) have debt service ratio (DSR) that were almost 
twice as high compared to other income groups. The vulnerable groups affected by 
the COVID -19 pandemic consist mostly of low income earners, in which their debt 
serviceability have not yet improved despite recent economic recovery. This is 
reflected in the high number of bank accounts, debtors, and outstanding amount of 
non-performing loans that exceed 90 days overdue since the COVID -19 pandemic 
(Chart 3). Among this group, 60% of borrowers owe their debt to specialized financial 
institutions (SFIs), 30% to non -banks, and 10% to commercial banks.

Box 4: Thailand’s household debt situation and financial vulnerabilities
Furthermore, persistently high household debt could impede long -term 
economic growth. A study by BIS (2017)1found that debt formulation by households 
would spur consumption and economic growth only for a short period, and that 
household debt to GDP ratio exceeding 80% would impede economic growth over the 
long term. For Thailand, the problem of household debt could become an even 
greater concern, as discovered when disaggregating household debt by loan purposes 
that personal loans under BOT supervision and credit card loans overall have been 
consistently increasing over the past 3 -4 years, especially those extended by 
non-banks. Furthermore, those loans extended are primarily unproductive loans that 
do not generate future income or wealth and are short -term loans with high interest 
rates which ultimately subject the borrowers to high debt burden. As of current, those 
unproductive personal and credit card loans grew at 11.9% year -on-year. Taking into 
consideration different income groups, low -income groups at the bottom 20% of all 
earners have the highest share of credit card loans and personal loans at around 42% 
of total household debt by income groups. Thus, the current household debt situation 
further exacerbates the already high debt burden  faced by the low -income groups  
which have the highest debt service ratio (Chart 4 and 5).

Box 4: Thailand’s household debt situation and financial vulnerabilities
The BOT acknowledges the importance of sustainably addressing Thailand’s 
household debt problems and recognizes that it should be addressed by utilizing 
targeted measures to achieve intended results. In the recent period, the BOT has 
launched measures to help alleviate household debt problems for vulnerable groups 
facing debt repayment difficulties such as encouraging banks to offer debt restructuring 
solutions that are best suited for the debtor’s abilities to repay debt, lowering the 
interest rate ceiling for some loan types, and temporarily reducing the minimum 
repayment rate. The aim of these measures is to reduce debt burden and help those 
whose debt serviceability has not fully recovered from the COVID -19 pandemic. 
Measures implemented during the initial phase were blanket measures rolled out in 
response to a severe situation, while measures implemented in the later phases were 
more targeted. At the same time, government agencies also implemented various 
measures to assist retail borrowers such as the Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural 
Cooperatives (BAAC)’s debt moratorium for retail borrowers and increased loans used 
for occupational purposes, and the Government Savings Bank’s debt moratorium on 
principal payments and offered interest repayment options to better align with the 
debtor’s current situation.If concerns regarding household debt are left unresolved, the conduct of 
policies to foster macroeconomic and financial stability will become more 
challenging. A study by the BOT ( 2023)2/ found that rising household debt is one of 
the reasons for sharp upturns in the financial cycle which affects the intertemporal 
trade-off between short -term and longer -term monetary policy objectives. In particular, 
low for long policy interest rate would accelerate credit growth which would further 
accumulate financial fragilities. Furthermore, rising household debt would also impede 
future economic growth as well as increase the likelihood and severity of future 
economic crises. A study by the BOT ( 2018)3/ found that the build -up of financial 
vulnerabilities from credit growth or higher asset prices during an upturn in the financial 
cycle, which corresponds to a 1% increase in the financial cycle index, would shift the 
growth -at-risk for 1-year ahead (risk scenario where GDP growth is at the 5thpercentile 
of the distribution) downward further by 0.28%. Therefore, it is important to resolve 
Thailand’s household debt problems so that it does not become an impediment to 
achieving monetary policy objectives of maintaining price stability, supporting sustainable
economic growth, and preserving financial stability.

Box 4: Thailand’s household debt situation and financial vulnerabilities
After the Thai economy recovered from the COVID -19 pandemic, the BOT 
announced a series of measures to systematically address household debt and 
resolve structural problems pertaining to household debt in a sustainable manner4/.  
The initial implementation would involve upgrading bank lending standards by (1) apply 
responsible lending measures throughout a borrower’s debt journey: from applying for a 
loan/whilst signing a loan contract, to being a debtor, having debt repayment problems, 
and to being filed a lawsuit or having their debts sold off. Moreover, the debtors would 
be provided relevant information in order to nudge their behaviors; and (2) assist the 
persistent debtors (starting with the revolving personal loans group) to repay their debts 
whilst having enough left for disposable income. The BOT is also considering additional 
measures namely risk -based pricing (RBP) and debt service ratio (DSR) limits. Beside 
aforementioned measures, effectively and sustainably addressing household debt problems
will require cooperation from all relevant stakeholders including government agencies, 
financial institutions, and most importantly the households themselves. There are 3 key 
priorities: (1) promote more cautious debt formation; (2) support initiatives to address 
problematic debt; and (3) foster good financial discipline, all of which would help households
maintain sustainable balance sheets and promote sound economic growth.
