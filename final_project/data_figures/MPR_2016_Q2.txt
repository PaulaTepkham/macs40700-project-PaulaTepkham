Monetary Policy Report  June  2016 
Monetary Policy in Thailand  
Monetary Policy Committee  
Under the Bank of Thailand Act, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) comprise s the 
governor and two deputy governors, as well as four distinguished external members  
representing various sectors of the economy , with the aim of ensuring  that monetary policy 
decisions are effective and transparent.  
Monetary Policy Objective  
The MPC sets monetary policy to promote  the objective of supporting sustainable a nd full 
potential economic growth, without causing inflationary problems or economic and financial 
imbalances or bubbles.  
Monetary Policy Target  
The Cabinet  approved the annual average headline inflation target of 2.5 + 1.5 percent as the 
target for 2016 and for the medium  term. The inflation target  is to assure the general public 
that the MPC will take necessary policy actions to return headline inflation to the target within 
an appropriate time horizon without jeopardi zing growth and macro -financial stability.  In the 
event that headline inflation deviates from the target, the MPC shall explain the reasons 
behind the target breach to the  Minister  of Finance and the  public, together with measures 
taken and estimated time to bring inflation back to the target.  
Monetary Policy Instrument   
The MPC utilizes the 1 -day bilateral repurchase transaction rate as the policy interest rate to 
signal the monetary policy stance.  
Evaluati on of Economic Conditions and Forecasts  
The Bank of Thailand takes into account  information from all sources, the macroeconomic 
model, data from each economic sector, as well as surveys  of large enterprises , together with  
small and medium -sized  enterprises from all over the country,  and various financial institutions  
to ensure that economic evaluations and forecasts are accurate and cover all aspects, both at 
the macro and micro levels.   
Monetary Policy Communication  
Recognizing the importance  of monetary policy communication to the public, the MPC 
employs  various  channel s of communication, both in Thai and English, such as (1) organizing 
a press statement at 14 :00 on the day of the Committee meeting, (2) publishing edited 
minutes of the MPC meeting two weeks after the meeting, and (3) publishing the Monetary 
Policy Report  every quarter.  Monetary Policy Report  June  2016

 The Thai economy is projected to grow  in 2016 at the same rate as 
estimated in the previous Monetary Policy Report at 3.1 percent . Exports remain  
constrained by both weak economic growth among trading partners and structural 
changes in global trade. However, the adverse impact is  offset by expansion in 
exports  of services, thanks to the increase in the number of foreign tourists, and 
by private con sumption that is supported by government spending and stimulus 
measures as well as improved  income growth among agricultural households 
following  rising  agricultural commodity prices.  For 2017, growth is slightly revised 
down from the previous estimate  to 3.2 percent on account of a slowdown in 
merchandise exports, while domestic demand and tourism will continue to drive 
growth going forward.  
Headline and core inflation this year is expected to remain close to the 
previous assessment. Cost -push inflationary  pressure is largely unchanged from 
the previous projection,  as upward adjustments in domestic oil prices are offset 
by lower electricity prices. Demand -pull inflationary  pressure is broadly 
unchanged, which is in line with the growth prospect that is mostly similar to the 
previous projection. For 2017, headline inflation is expected to pick up gradually 
in tandem with the gradual rise in global oil prices. Core inflation is also projected 
to pick up, albeit at a slightly slower pace compared with the p revious assessment, 
in tandem with the economy that will grow at a slightly more moderate pace than 
expected.  
The Committee kept the policy interest rate unchanged at the May and 
June 2016 meetings. According to the Committee’s assessment, the Thai 
economy  continues to recover despite downside risks on both the domestic and 
external fronts. Inflation will return to the lower bound of the inflation target within 
the latter half of this year. Meanwhile, monetary conditions remain accommodative  
and conducive t o the economic recovery, as reflected in the real interest rates and 
bond yields that remain at low levels. The Committee emphasizes the need to 
preserve policy space as cushion for future risks that have the potential to 
negatively affect the ongoing reco very. The Committee will continue to monitor 
risks to financial stability, particularly the search -for-yield behavior and 
underpricing of risks that may arise in the prolonged low interest rate environment.  Monetary Policy Report June 2016           2 1.1 Growth and inflation prospects  
The Committee maintains the GDP growth  
forecast for 2016 at 3.1 percent (Table 1.1). Key 
growth drivers consist of (1) hig her-than-expected 
exports  of services that expand on the back of 
strong  growth in the tourism sector  and (2) 
continued government expenditure , underpinned 
by effective disbursement as well as additional 
stimulus measures , that helps bolster private -sector  
confidence and spending. The role of government 
expenditure is critically important  especially when 
merchandise exports have  yet to recover , given  the 
sluggish growth in trading partners ’ economies , 
especially in Asia, and  changes in the global trade 
structure.  
Private consumption is projected to expand 
at a rate close  to the previous assessment . Tourism 
receipts and  income s of agricultural households , 
the latter of which  grow faster than expected due to 
rising agricultural commodity prices , help offset  
partly  the decline in the income s of households  
that involve with export -oriented manufacturing . 
Meanwhile,  private investment is projected to 
improv e relative to the previous forecast  due mainly 
to the outlays for construction in connection with  
government projects. However , outlays for  machinery  
and equipment are expected to remain at low levels 
consistent with weak merchandise exports.  
For 2017 , domestic demand will continue 
to be the main growth driver , although  its 
momentum is estimated to  soften slightly from the  
previous projection . This is a result of (1) subdued 
merchandise exports held down in part  by 
structural problems in global trade and (2) the 
waning of the stimulus effects of  government 
measures  on private -sector  expenditure . The

projection next year  to 3.2 percent, down from 
3.3 percent (Table 1.1 ). This is consistent with 
the output gap that is projected to widen 
somewhat in 2017  compared to the previous 
estimate  (Chart 1.1) . 
Consistent with the growth projection  
above , the forecast of core  inflation  for 2016  is 
kept unchanged at 0.8 percent, while the 2017 
projection is revised down to 1.0 percent  from  
1.1 percent.  In addition , this year’s cost-push 
inflationary pressure  is estimated to be mostly 
unchanged from the previous projection , since  
increase in domestic oil prices in tandem with an 
upward revision of global crude prices  is offset by 
lower electricity prices . In sum, the Committee 
keeps  unchanged the projection for headline 
inflation for 2016 at 0.6 percent, consistent with 
core inflation and cost -push inflation that are 
broadly unchanged  this year , and maintain s the 
headline inflation projection for 2017 at 2.2 
percent , as the effect of  the rising cost -push 
inflationary pressure is estimated t o be  offset 
by the declining demand -pull inflationary 
pressure. (Table 1.1) . 
The Committee has incorporated key 
economic  developments into the growth and 
inflation forecasts as summarized below.  
(1) Trading partners’ economies are 
likely to grow at a slower pace than previously 
assessed  (Table 1.2).  
The Committee revise s down the projection 
of trading partners ’ GDP growth for 2016 , as Asian 
economi es are expected to slow down further than 
previously anticipated. This is due to both  the 
changes in the global trade structure that will 
negatively affect intra -regional trade  and the slower -
than-expected recovery of advanced economies .

** Weighted by each trading partner’s share of Thailand’s total exports 
as of 2014Monetary Policy Report June 2016           4 For 2017, t rading partners’ GDP growth projection 
remains unchanged. While t he US and Asia n 
economies  are expected to record wea ker growth, 
it is anticipated that Japan will expand faster than 
previously projected,  given that  the increase in the 
sales tax, initially scheduled for 2017, has now 
been pushed back to 2019. Meanwhile, g rowth in 
the euro area  and China is expected to slow down 
in line with  the previous assessment.  
In addition to w eaker growth of trading 
partners, changes in the global trade structure , 
whereby import dependencies have reduced in 
many economies , contribute to the continuous 
decline in  both the global trade volume  and 
Emerging Asia ’s export volume in particular   
(Chart 1.2) . Such development is one of the ke y 
factor s that leads to greater contraction in 
Thailand’s  merchandise export volume than 
previously  anticipated.  Consequently , Thailand’s 
export value is estimated to decline despite an 
upward revision of export prices thanks to  higher -
than-expected commodity and crude oil prices. The 
Committee revised down the export value 
projection to a contraction of 2.5 percent in 
2016, larger than the  2.0 percent decline 
according to the previous assessment . The 
export value for  2017 is projected to remain 
unchanged from the prior year’s level, close to  
the 0.1 percent  growth estimated previously.  
Given the sluggish global economic 
recovery, m onetary policy in major economies is 
likely to remain  accommodative. The Federal 
Reserve  has maintained an accommodative 
monetary policy stance for  longer than the 
Committee previo usly expected . Most recently, t he 
federal funds rate was kept on hold at the latest 
Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting 
in June, following the release of May employment

also in anticipation of the results of the United 
Kingdom (UK) European Union (EU) membership 
referendum that could spark volatility in global 
financial market s. The Committee expects  that the 
FOMC is likely to wait for clear er signs of recovery 
in the US labor market before deciding on a  rate 
hike in the latter half of this year  and continuing with 
another rate hike next year. Meanwhile, the Bank 
of Japan has continued with monetary easing 
through quantitative and qualitative  easing with the 
negative interest  rate policy . Looking  ahead, 
monetary policy divergence amo ng major 
advanced economies will continue to be a n 
important factor  contributing to volatilities in  capital 
flows and exchange rate s going forward.  
The Committee  expects that trading 
partners’ economies will be faced with greater 
downside risks . One of these risks is China’s 
financial stability concerns which stem from 
elevated corporate debt that potentially result s in 
financing difficulties  for businesses  and state -
owned enterprises , thereby increasing default risks 
and costs of funds . Additional risks that warrant 
close monitoring  are (1) uncertainties in monetary 
policy of major economies and (2) the UK’s exit 
from the EU  (Brexit) . These risks could add to 
volatility in global financial market s and could have 
greate r economic impact s than expected.  
(2) Crude oil prices in the global market , 
which  were  higher than previously expected in 
the second quarter of 2016 , are projected to rise 
over the forecast horizon (Chart 1.3).  
The Committee revise s up the projection for 
Dubai crude price throughout the forecast horizon. 
The oil p rice is expected to average at 43.1 US 
dollars per barrel in 2016, up from  the previous 
estimate of 37.3 US dollars per  barrel. This upward

Mar 16         Jun 16U.S. dollars per barrelMonetary Policy Report June 2016           6 revision is due to the more -than-expected increase 
in oil prices in the second quarter of this year  as a 
result of supply -side factors. Oil production in many 
OPEC countries has slowed , putting upward 
pressure on prices both recently  and going forward . 
In particular , lingering  political te nsions in Nigeria 
and financial problems in Venezuela are major 
factors behind the supply shortage. Meanwhile, 
production in non-OPEC countries remain s low on 
account  of US producers having withdrawn  from 
exploration and drilling of shale oil. Looking ahead, 
the Committee thus expects  that the global oil 
market will enter into new equilibrium  more quickly , 
which will prompt US shale oil producers to resu me 
production once prices exceed the break -even 
point , and that t he increase in oil prices is expected 
to decelerate around the end of the forecast horizon.    
The more -than-expected increase in global 
oil prices will result in higher domestic retail oil 
prices compared with the previous projection. 
However, domestic energy prices as a whole are 
not expected to significantly increase due to the 
decline in electricity prices1/ that will offset this 
year’s higher oil prices.  
Prices of agricultur al products have risen 
alongside crude oil prices , helping support farm 
income  growth and sustain household consumption.  
Moreover, higher crude oil and other commodity 
prices lead to increasing export prices , helping 
                                                        
1/ The Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) approved the 
decrease of the float time (Ft) surcharge in May through 
to August 2016 by 28.49 satang per unit. This resolution 
was based on  the cost of natural gas used to fuel power 
generation that fell over the previous six months, together 
with the lower  electricity purchase cost s by the Electricity 
Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) as privately 
owned electric power plants were unabl e to deliver 
electrical currents in accordance with their contractual 
agreement with EGAT.  Monetary Policy Report June 2016           7 cushion somewhat the effects of the decline in the 
merchandise export volume. Notwithstanding, 
overall  farm income re main s low, owing partly to 
the fact that higher prices still can not fully offset the 
impact of the drought. This, together  with elevated 
levels of household debt, will weigh on private 
consumption going forward.  
The Committee judges risks to crude oil 
prices to be balanced. Downside risks are as follow : 
(1) global oil demand may be lower than anticipated 
given a delayed global recovery; (2) shale oil 
producers may resume production sooner than the 
baseline projection as oil prices rises; and (3) 
supply of crude oil from OPEC producers may be 
larger than expected as they increase production to 
maintain their market share. On the other hand, 
upside risks come mainly from conflicts in the 
Middle East which potentially spread to major oil 
production location s. 
(3) The number of tourists has risen more 
than expected  as a result of continued  tourist  
growth  in almost all  nationality groups . Going 
forward,  growth  in the number of tourists  is 
estimated  to exceed the previous projection . 
Export s of services are expected to grow 
strongly  on the back of increase s in the number  of 
tourists  that is higher than previously assessed. 
Particularly , the number of Chinese tourists has 
increased significantly, while other nationalities have 
shown clearer signs of recovery. The number of 
Russian tourist s, in particular, has turned around with 
positive growth after two consecutive years of 
contraction as the Russian economy has gradually 
recover ed. Moreover , the expansion of low -cost 
airline routes, both of local and international airlines, 
has been a key supporting factor to the robust growth  
in Thailand’s tourism sector. The Committee estimates  
the number of foreign tourists to rise to  34 million in Monetary Policy Report June 2016           8 2016, up from the  previous assessment of 32.4 
million , and 36.7 million in 2017, up from the  previous 
projection of  34.4 million.  
Improved employment in the service sector 
thanks to  tourism has partly offset income loss in the 
manufacturing sector  following the export slowdown. 
The strength of the service sect or thus contribute s to 
an overall expansion in household income which has 
support ed private consumption over the recent 
period. However, going forward, the service sector 
may not be able to absorb labor reallocation  from 
other sectors , as labor demand in t he service sector 
has started to soften . Moreover, elevated household 
debt ha s induced more cautious spending behavior. 
In this regard, private consumption is expected to 
recover at a slow pace.  
(4) The public sector continu es to play a 
critical  role in sustaining the economy through 
public expenditure , which is consistent with  
the previous assessment, as well as through 
additional stimulus measures.  
Overall, the public sector’s disbursement for 
investment spending and financial commitments is 
continuously moving forward . The Committee thus 
revise s up the projection for public consumption 
following the expedited disbursement of transfer 
payments to the National Health Security Fund in the 
first quarte r of this year . Meanwhile, t he Committee 
expects public investment in 2016 to remain close to 
the previous projection  and to rise  slightly in 2017 due 
to expedited carry -over expenditure in accordance 
with the  Transfer of Expenses Budget Act, B.E. 255 9. 
The outlook for investment of state-owned 
enterprises (SOEs) also remain s largely unchanged 
despite some delay in the Prachua p Khiri Khan   
Chumphon dual -track rail project.  
Public expenditure has been  well on -track, 
especially those related to government  measures to Monetary Policy Report June 2016           9 improve living standards in pr ovincial sub -districts . 
These measures involve transfers to sub-district  
agencies for the purpose of consump tion and 
investment , which in effect directly induc es private -
sector spending.  In addition , the public sector’s 
outlays for construction have helped accommodate 
labor movement out of the agricultural sector over the 
recent period. This, in combination with the recover y 
in domestic demand, will in the short run aid private 
investment to grow faster  than the previous 
assessment. Nonetheless, priva te investment is 
expected to moderate going forward due to the 
waning of effects from stimulus spending and due to 
more subdued external demand that potentially affect 
future earnings  and investment plans.  
The Committee judge s the balance of risks to 
public spending  to be tilted to the upside.  Upside risks 
include  (1) some SOE investment projects —including  
additional dual -track rails, high -speed rail projects,  
and new express -way routes —that may commence  
next year , earlier than previously expected , and  
(2) higher -than-expected  expenditure  by local 
governments thanks to measures to expedite  
disbursement of the accumulated funds  of local 
administrative organizations. Downside risks include 
(1) limited efficiency of spending disbursement by 
some government agencies , (2) rescission of funds 
already made available  but not yet entered into 
financial commitments , and (3) political unc ertainties 
which can pose a delay in public expenditure.  
Risks to Growth and Inflation Forecasts  
The Committee views  risks to growth to 
remain tilted to the downside, as reflected in the 
growth fan chart that is skewed downward 
throughout the forecast horizon (Chart 1.4).  
Downside risks to growth are (1) weaker -than-
expected  growth of trading partners, particularly 
China as a result of  financial stability concerns , (2)

less financial cushion for economic uncertainties 
than previously expected , and (3) political uncertainties  
that may affect public spending and tourism. 
Nevertheless , upside risks include (1) government 
investment that may be undertaken  sooner and 
greater than expected , together with the effects  of 
government stimulus that may turn out  greater than 
the baseline projection, and (2) the number of 
tourists that may be gr eater than the baseline  
projection . With regard to inflation , the Committee 
judge s the balance of  risks to both headline and 
core inflation to be tilted to the downside  in line 
with the balance of risks to growth (Chart 1.5 
and 1.6) . 
1.2 Monetary policy decision   
Monetary policy remained  accommodative  
in the second quarter of 2016  to support the 
ongoing economic recovery that continue s to face  
downside risks on both domestic and external 
fronts. The Committee will continue to closely 
monitor financial sta bility risks arising from 
prolonged low interest rates  and emphasizes  the 
need to preserve policy space given remaining 
uncertainties over the economic outlook.  
At the MPC meeting on May 11, 2016, the 
Committee voted unanimously to maintain the 
policy rate  at 1.50 percent per annum. In deliberating  
this decision, the Committee assessed that the 
Thai economy continued to expand at a pace 
close to the assessment in the previous 
meeting . Headline inflation  was expected to 
pick up  gradually  after turning positi ve in April ,

economic growth was judged to be tilted more to 
the downside as the impact of the drought on 
agricultural households was likely to weigh on 
private consumption going forward.  
Meanwhile, m onetary conditions eased 
further  because of  lower bond yields and the 
recent cuts in lending rates by  commercial banks . 
Moreover, m onetary conditions  were judged to 
remain  accommodative  despite the fact that the 
Thai baht appreciated against some trading 
partners’ currencies at some points which might 
have not be en as conducive to the economic 
recovery as  it could  have  been. 
The Committee viewed that keeping the 
policy rate on hold at this meeting would help 
preserve policy space  for risks that could have 
negative impact on  the ongoing economic recovery.  
These risks include d a possible delay in the global 
economic recovery, weaker consumption  growth , 
and political uncertainties that might  affect both 
private investment and consumption. Additionally, 
some committee members viewed t he current 
economic slowdown to  be attributed  to structural 
problems, both domestically and globally, which 
could not be addressed by monetary policy alone . 
Moreover , cutting the policy rate at this juncture 
could  potentially lead to further accumulation of 
imbalances in the financial sector , especially given 
that interest rates remained low for an extended 
period . The Committee would also  continue to 
closely monitor risks to financial stability , particularly  
the search -for-yield behavior that could  exacerbate 
underpricing of risks, and the possibility  of a 
snapback of global bond yields, which  could affect 
financing conditions , balance sheets of businesses,  
and the overall monetary conditions through 
adjustments in Thai government bond yields.  Monetary Policy Report June 2016           12 In the following MPC meeting on June 22, 
2016, the Committee voted unanimously to 
maintain the policy rate at 1.50 percent per annum. 
The Committee projected that the Thai economy  
would continue to recover and inflation would 
return to the target band in t he latter half of the 
year in line with previous assessment.  Meanwhile,  
monetary conditions remained accommodative and 
conducive to the ongoing recovery. Looking ahead, 
the Committee viewed that monetary policy should 
continue to be accommodative  and would continue 
to closely monitor  financial stability risks.  
In deliberating this decision, the Committee 
gave due consideration  to Thailand’s o ngoing 
economic recovery . Going forward, the economy 
would be driven primarily by public expenditure and 
tourism. At the same time, p rivate consumption 
would improve in line with previous assessment 
while private investment would continue to be at a 
low level . However, merchandise exports were 
projected  to contract in tandem with slower -than-
expected  growth o f Asian economies . In light of 
these developments, the Committee assessed that 
the economic momentum from d omestic demand 
and tourism would help offset the impact of weaker 
exports. As a result,  the economi c outlook would be 
largely unchanged  and the econo my would  expand  
at the same pace  as assessed  in the previous 
meeting. Nevertheless, there remained  several 
downside risks to growth , namely  weaker -than-
expected growth in trading partners and fragility in  
private -sector sentiments . Incidentally, p revious 
concerns pertaining to the impact of the drought 
subsided along with the  recovery in prices of some 
agricultural commodities.  
The Committee also gave due consideration  
to the inflation outlook where headline inflation 
was projected to return to  the  lower  bound of 
the inflation target  within the latter half  of 2016 Monetary Policy Report June 2016           13 as previously expected.   Meanwhile, medium -
term inflation expectations remained well -
anchored  around the inflation target.  Demand -
pull inflationary pressure increased somewhat due 
to the ongoing economic recovery , as reflected in 
core inflation that edged up slightly. Head line 
inflation was projected  to pick up gradually as 
energy prices would rise in tandem  with crude oil 
prices. Medium -term inflation expectations (5-10 
years ahead) base d on a survey of professional 
economists’ remained well -anchored  around the 
inflation target of 2.5 percent .  
Monetary conditions  were accommodative  
throughout recent periods  and were  conducive to 
the economic recovery and  the return of headline 
inflation  to the target. Accommodative monetary 
conditions  were  reflected in low real interest rates 
and the continued expansion of total corporate 
financing and lending to household s, although 
certain businesses faced limitations in accessing 
credit s. Going forward , the Committee still saw  the 
need to continue monitoring financial stability risks , 
including the search -for-yield behavior,  in the 
prolonge d low interest rate environment.   
Finally , the Committee assessed the 
preservation  of policy space to be critical , given 
that the economy would face various risks going 
forward. These risks include d the fragile global 
economic recovery, monetary policy divergence, 
financial stability concerns in China, as well as  
Brexit. The Committee would  stand ready to utilize 
an appropriate mix of available policy tools in order 
to make sure  that monetary conditions and the 
exchange rate remain  conducive to the economic 
recovery  as well as to ensure  financial stability.  Monetary Policy Report June 2016           14 1.3 Appendix:  Tables for supporting assumptions and forecasts

2.1 The global economy   
 Asia (excluding China and Japan ) 
 The recovery  of Asian  economies  moderated  
due to exports  being  weaker  than expected  as a 
result  of both the slowdown  in China  and changes  in 
the global  trade  structure.  Meanwhile,  advanced  
economies  continued  to recover  at a gradual  pace,  
although  this was not sufficient  to spur growth  in 
Asian  merchandise  exports  values.  
 Asian  economies,  excluding  China  and 
Japan,  slowed  down  in the first quarter  of 2016  
(Chart  2.1) on account  of contrac tion in merchandise  The global  economic  recovery  slowed  on account  of Asian  economies,  
whose  growth  weakened  as a result  of (1) cyclical  factors  such  as the slowdown  
in China , while  the recovery  in G3 economies  were  not sufficient  to spur growth  in 
Asian  exports  and (2) structural  factors,  including  changes  in the global  trade  
structure  that affected  supply  chains,  a loss of competitiveness,  and the transition  
toward  an aging  society,  that weighed  on each  economy  differently . On the  
other  hand,  advanced  economies  continued  to recover  gradually , driven by 
consumption  due to improvements  in labor  market  conditions.    
The Thai economy  continued  to recover  at a gradual  pace  on the back  of 
tourism  and public  spending.  Private  consumption  expanded  on account  of growth  
in income  and employment  in the service  sector , but continued  to be restrained  by 
the decline in farm income  because  of the drought  and by elevated  household  
debt.  Meanwhile,  merchandise  exports,  excluding  gold,  contracted  in tandem  with 
the slowdown  among  Asian  economies,  which  were Thailand’s  key trading partners.  
Such  developments  caused  overall  production  and investment  remaining  at low levels.   
Headline  inflation  turned  positive  with the acceleration  in fresh  food and 
energ y prices,  and core inflation  edged  up slightly  due to higher  input  costs  and 
demand -pull inflationary  pressure  that increased  somewhat.  Going  forward,  
headline  inflation  was expected  to gradually  pick up alongside  global  crude  oil prices.

(change from same quarter last year)
Source: CEICMonetary Policy Report  June  2016              19 exports  as a result  of weak  external  demand,  
especially  from China.  Meanwhile,  the recovery  in 
advanced  economies  was not able to induce  growth  
in Asian  exports  (Chart  2.2). Thus,  the subdued  
export  outlook  continued  to weigh  down  on investment  
and production  in many  regional  economies.  In 
addition,  heightened  global  financial  market  volatility  
during  the first quarter  led to a broad -based  decline  in 
the equity  indices  of many  countries,  which  negatively  
affected  households’  wealth  through  lower  asset  
prices.  Combined  with already  weak  consumer  
confidence,  such developments  amounted  to a 
slowdown  in private  consumption.  
 Looking  ahead,  the recovery  of Asian  
economies,  excluding  China  and Japan,  was 
expected  to moderate  further  from the previous  
assessment  in March.  This was consistent  with an 
absence  of any clear signs  of export  recovery  due to 
the sluggish  global  growth . In addition,  exports  were  
restrained  by structural  limitations  such as aging  
population  that limited potential  growth,  loss of 
competitiveness,  and changes  in the global  trade  
structure  as China  and advanced  economies  turned  
to domestic -based  supply  chain s. Against  this 
backdrop , the share  of trade  in world  GDP  trended 
downward  (Chart  2.3), and therefore  Asia’s  trade  
would  not be able to fully reap the benefit s from the 
recovery  of advanced  economies.  These  limitations  
would  continue  to drag on Asian  export s and 
economic  growth  in the period  ahead  despite  the 
improvement  in the terms  of trade  due to rising  oil 
prices .    
 China  
 China’s  economic  growth  continued  to 
moderate  due to both export  contraction  and 
domestic  demand , particularly  investment , which  
slowed  down  as result  of ongoing  reforms  to achieve  
longer -term economic  sustainability.

  The Chinese economy expanded at a 
rate of 6.7 percent (yoy) in the first quarter of 
2016, a slight moderation from 6.8 percent in 
the previous quarter.  The marginally lower  growth 
was due to contraction in net export s that stemmed 
from weak trading partners’ demand  and investment   
in the industrial sector  which slowed down despite 
improvements in infrastructure and real-estate  
investment  following  stimulus measures to boost 
short-term growth. Meanwhile, consumption continued  
to expand. Latest indicators  as of May 2016  (Chart 
2.4) pointed to a continued moderation in China’s 
economic growth , partly because of excess production  
capacity in many industries which suggested a 
weak  outlook for manufacturing  production and 
investment . 
 Going f orward, growth would  slow down 
further  as a result of ongoing economic reforms. 
China’s financial stability continued  to warrant 
close monitoring given heightened default risks in 
the banking sector and bond markets  as well as the 
shad ow banking sector. Consequently , financial 
conditions in China tightened . This is because of 
stricter  credit  standard s following signs of weakened  
financial health in the corporate sector  and also 
because of the  greater emphasis  by the Chinese 
authorities  on financial stability regulations as one 
of this year  key’s economic policies. In any case , 
China’s economic growth this year  would  likely be 
within the authorities’ target of 6.57.0 percent.  
 Advanced Economies  
 Advanced  economies  recovered  on the back 
of domestic  demand,  especially  private  consumption  
that gained  momentum  on the back of gradual  
improvements  in labor  market  conditions  (Chart  2.5).

was mainly attributed to the decline in private 
consumption. This owed partly to the temporal 
decline in automobile sales following an acceleration   
in the second half of last year . Meanwhile , private 
investment  contracted,  especially  in mining and 
energy sectors which  was affected by persistently 
low o il prices. Investment  in residential property , on 
the other hand, improved  in tandem with the 
recovery in the labor market. In addition, net 
exports were  held down by weak trading partners’  
demand . Inventories contin ued to decline.  
 Latest indicators for the US economy 
pointed to a continued recovery driven primarily  
by domestic demand, particularly from private 
consumption. Retail sales picked up across all 
product categories, and manuf acturing production 
looked to improve gradually , as reflected in the 
purchasing manager’s index that registered  above 
50. However, exports remained weak in line with 
sluggish  global growth. In any case , the Federal 
Reserve would  likely delay further hike s in the 
federal funds rate given  the release of the US non-
farm payroll data for May 2016 that turned out much 
weaker  than expected.  
 The euro area economies grew 0.6 
percent (qoq sa) in the first quarter of 2016, up 
from 0.4 percent in the previous quarter , driven 
by stronger domestic demand , especial ly in France 
and Germany where  private consumption picked up  
significantly. These  development s were  supported 
by gradual improvements in employment conditions,  
low oil prices that boosted purchasing power of th e 
private sector, and accommodative monetary 
policy that benefited the financial sector and helped 
support lending to both businesses and households . 
Nevertheless , the decline in exports due to  weak 
global demand continued to weigh on  growth.  Monetary Policy Report  June  2016              22 
  Going forward, a lthough the euro area 
would  retain forward momentum fr om domestic 
demand , fiscal policy would  likely  be tighten ed as 
many member countries were unable to reduce 
fiscal deficit s in accordance with t he their budgetary 
targets . In addition, r ising o il prices could pose 
limitations to growth. Geopolitical risks and political 
uncertainties in many countries could  also affect 
the economic recovery in the euro area and the 
global economy. The Committee would therefore 
closely monitor these risks as they could have 
implications for global financial markets , Thailand’s  
trading partners’ growth, and appropriate  monetary 
policy  going forward . 
 The Japanese economy recorded a 
growth  of 0.5 percent (qoq  sa) in the first quarter 
of 2016, a turnaround from a cont raction of 0.4 
percent in the previous quarter  thanks  to 
expansion in private consumption. Growth  in 
consumer spending was due partly to a rebound 
from the previous quarter when it slowed down due 
to the unusually warm weather conditions . 
Meanwhile, total exports improved on account of 
exports to the euro ar ea. However, private 
investment  contracted , following  two consecutive 
quarters of growth , as business confidence 
declined owing to a weaker growth outlook in 
trading partners, the strengthening of the ye n, and 
heightened financial market volatility at the 
beginning of the year.  
 In the period ahead, Japan’s economic 
recovery  would  likely proceed at a gradual pace. 
The economy would likely  gain further traction 
thanks to the announced postponement of the 
increase in the sales tax, initially scheduled for April 
2017, for another two and a half years to help 
sustain consumption . Support would also likely 
come from  additional easing of both monetary and Monetary Policy Report  June  2016              23 fiscal policies. Nevertheless, there remained  important  
risks facing the Japanese economy , namely global 
financial market volatility that could  affect domestic 
demand through more subdued private sector 
confidence, a potential yen appreciation, and 
monetary policy transmission to the real economy 
which might n ot be as effective given increasing  
risks on the external front.  
2.2 The domestic economy  
The Thai economy  continued  to expand  at 
a gradual  pace  on the back  of tourism  and public  
spending.  Private  consumption  was well maintained  
thanks  to growth  in income  and employment  in the 
service  sector.  Nevertheless,  exports  continued   
to contract  in tandem  with the slowdown  of major  
trading  partners’  economies.  Consequently,  investment  
remained  at a low level (Chart  2.6). 
Tourism and public spending  still play ed a crucial 
role in sustaining economic momentum . 
Tourism continued to expand  strongly ,  
in part because of Thailand’s popularity as  a travel 
destination among Chinese tourists with increasing 
preferences to travel abroad. In addition, an 
expansion  of low -cost airline routes to Thailand  
helped boost tourism potential , while the number  
of visitors from various regions including Asia and 
Europe showed clearer signs of rebound (Chart 2.7 ). 
These positive developments therefore  benefited 
the related service industries such as the hotel  
and restaurant, transportation, and wholesale -retail 
sectors.  
Public spending , especially investment 
expenditure by the central government, continued  
to underpin growth, despite a slight deceleration

 following the expedited disbursement at the 
beginning  of the second quarter this year.  Meanwhile, 
capital outlays by  state-owned enterprises expanded 
continuously, sustained in part by outlays for major 
investment projects , such as the Chira Khon Kaen  
and Chachoengsao Kaeng Khoi dual -track rail 
projects,  that were part of the government’s  
infrastructure development plan. Current spending 
also expanded well thanks  to the government ’s 
measures to improve living standards in provincial 
sub-districts  as well as expedited disbursement of 
funds by  the National Health Security Fund in the 
first quarter (Chart 2.8 ).  
Private consumption continued to expand, supported  
by growth in income and employment in the service 
sector . 
Private consumption  continued to  expand  
on account of  spending on non -durable goods and 
services , especially hotel and restaurant  services  
as well as recreation. Nonetheless, automobile 
purchases still contracted , having accelerat ed 
toward the end of last year prior to an increase in 
the vehicle excise tax. Meanwhile, low purchasing 
power of agricultural households owing to  the 
drought and elevated household debt remained 
headwinds  affecting consum er confidence and 
private consumption (Chart 2.9 ) (Box: The 
economic impacts of drought on agriculture at the 
regional level ). However, sustained growth in 
income and employment in the service sector  
could somewhat help sustain overall household 
purchasing  power  (Chart 2.10 ).

contract despite an improvement in export prices 
on the back of  rising oil prices .   
Global economic slowdown and shifts 
in the global trade structure continued to 
adversely affect the export sector in several  
countries , especially in Emerging Asia which 
constituted Thailand’s  most important trading 
partners.  As a result, Thailand’s merchandise 
export s to Asia  continued to  contract in most 
product categories, such as  exports of machinery 
and equipment  which  declined in almost all  
destination markets. This was especially the case 
for Asian countries where  investment was restrained  
by export slowdown. Furthermore, Thai exports of  
petroleum  as well as  petrochemical and chemical 
products  continued to decline  owing to sharp 
deceleration in demand after China could increase 
production  by itself . 
Export prices slightly rebounded from 
the levels seen at  the end of 2015 on the back 
of incrasing global crude oil prices ( Chart 2.11 ). 
Oil prices increased after the supply by the 
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries 
(OPEC) trended lower following a decline in oil 
production in a number of countries , including  
Nigeria and Venezuela . 
Export contraction and slow recovery of domestic 
demand caused growth in private investment to 
remain  low. 
Private investment growth remained  
low. Despite an acceleration in the first quarter of 
this year due to construction outlays underpinned 
by government investment stimulus measures, in 
particular measures to improve living standards in 
provincial sub -districts , outlays for  machinery and 
equipment remained low (Chart 2.12 ). Investment 
in the manufacturing sector continued to be

 restrained  by contraction in the merchandise export 
sector, weak  domestic business sentiment, and 
excess production capacity —all of these made it 
unnecessary to further invest (Chart 2.13 ). 
Nonetheless, investment in the service sector 
continued to expand , although growth was  low  
and only limited to some businesses such as 
telecommunication s and alternative  energy.  
2.3 Production cost and price conditions   
Headline inflation  turned positive thanks to 
an increase in fresh food and oil prices, while core 
inflation edged up slightly on account of a modest 
increase in  costs and demand pressures following 
the slow pace of domestic demand recovery.  
The Committee anticipated a gradual  rise in 
headline inf lation  on the back of  rising  global oil 
prices,  and would continue to closely  monitor 
domestic demand recovery going forward.    
Headline inflation turned posi tive in the 
second quarter  of 2016, with the average for t he 
first two months of 0.26 percent ( yoy)  
(Chart 2.14) , on account of rising fresh food and 
retail oil prices . The increase in fresh food prices  
was due to  a decline  in the vegetables and fruits  
supply as a result of  the drought . However, f resh 
food prices were expected to drop once rainfall  
returned  to normal. Meanwhile, domestic retail  oil 
prices trended up in line with global crude prices  
following the decline  in US and OPEC  oil suppl y 
and the slight increase  in oil demand, in particular  
from China  and India . 
Core inflation for the first two months of the 
second quarter  averaged at  0.78 percent  (yoy) 
(Chart 2.15 ), up slightly from the last quarter , as

(Apr –May)Monetary Policy Report  June  2016              27 increase in fresh food  prices . This was consistent 
with a finding that one percentage increase in fresh 
food prices would raise core inflation by 0.02 
percent1/. At the same time the recovery of 
domestic demand induced more demand -pull 
inflationary pressure, as reflected in a slightly 
upward trend of underlying i nflation indicators 
(Chart 2.16 ). Nonetheless, most prices of goods 
and services in the core consumer price basket 
remained largely unchanged (Chart 2.17 ), 
reflect ing limited price adjustment s. Short -term 
inflation expectations edged up slightly in line wi th 
in rising inflationary pressure. One-year-ahead 
inflation expectations according to survey s of 
professional economists and businesses , respectively , 
stood at 1.9  percent  as of June 2016 and 2.03  
percent  as of May  2016. Medium -term inflation 
expectations remained near the inflation target , 
with five -year-ahead inflation expectations based 
on a survey of professional economists staying at 
2.5 percent as of April 2016 (Chart 2.18) .  
Looking ahead, the Committee  estimated 
that headline inflation  would remain positive and 
gradually rise on the back of an upward trend in 
global crude prices . In any case , the Committee 
would continue to monitor the recovery of domestic 
demand and developments of inflation expectations  
closely.

Calculations of percentage change from last quarter, seasonally adjusted, 
by Bank of ThailandMonetary Policy Report  June 2016   29 The economic impact s of drought on agriculture  at the regional level  
The drought caused  by El Niño  has impacted Thai land’s  agricultural sector  since the 
end of 2014. Rainfall fell below average  and dam water for irrigation stayed at a low level (Chart 1) . 
The drought  adversely  affected  farmers who depended  on water in irrigated area s—estimated  
to be more than 30 million rai, or 20 percent of land  countrywide used for agricultural purpose s. 
The most affected area was  the Chao Phraya and Mae Klong watershed s where off-season 
rice was planted . As a result, off -season rice production in 2016 was estimated to decline  not 
only from the previous year ’s level but much below the level in 2014  that was considered  a 
normal year  (Chart 2 ). In addition, the current drought was widely expected to  be more severe 
than those in the past and would affect  almost all croppers nationwide .  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The i mpact s on farm income  and responses by farmers  
Farmers in each region were affected differently  depending on  geographical factors and 
types of plants grown.  Northern and central regions, which mainly grow off -season rice, suffered  
more than other regions . Of the central region , the lower part was most affected  as it was at the 
tail-end and downstream of the irrigation scheme . Meanwhile , the lower part of the northern 
region and the upper part of the central region, located at the up stream of the irrigation scheme , 
were second most  affected  areas.  The no rtheastern region  was not  much impacted because  
most farmers did not grow  off-season rice . The southern region suffered  least beca use rubber 
and palm oil , grown by most farmers  there , were drought -tolerant relative to rice.  
For this year’s  drought season, most farmers stop grow ing off-season rice1/. Farmers in 
the central and northern region s reduce  cropping areas by 80 and 70 percent, respectively. 
While only a small number of farmers , whose  cropping areas located near water resources , can 
grow and harvest, their production is estimated to fall by  20 percent  relative to  a normal year2/. 
As a result , most farmers wait to grow in -season rice. This year’s overall  production is therefore

region s in April 2016.  
2/ Off-season rice production in a normal year was on average 1,000 kilograms  per rai . In 2016, this drops  to 
800 kilograms  per rai .

falling by 30 percent from the earlier  period,  overall farm income  is estimated to decrease  by 
45 percent from the normal level.      
Drought -affected f armers have  limited  options in response . First, most farmers  are of 
old age and thus  not flexible  in moving out to the  non-agricultural sector . Second, f armers 
cannot  resort  to growing drought -tolerant plants  entirely , as water  is still not possibly sufficient  
and the Royal Irrigation Department no longer  distributes  water in some areas.  Third,  the 
availability of nonfarm jobs, such as 
those in construction or paid daily 
works , is limited  and varies  
depending on slack in each  locality’s  
industries.   Thus, it is not always 
possible to  absorb all workers from  
the agricultural sector.  
Such limited  response options  
cause most farmers to adapt 
financially  by borrowing  from bank s 
or loan shark s in order to maintain  
their subsistent level of consumption 
(Chart 3) . Although some of them 
can rely on  temporary transfers from 
their children  working  in the non-
agricultural sector, this  cannot  
completely offset  the drought impact. 
Thus, overall purchasing power of  
the agricultural households  declines . 
The drought also affect s 
agriculture -related businesses4/. 
More than 50 percent of rice mills  
nationwide  have  to close their 
business temporarily , while some that still operate  reduce hiring to maintain their financial 
liquidity5/. Suppliers of farm inputs, with little  adaptation, lose their revenues  by 50-80 percent 
relative to  last year , as t hey decide to just wait for the next growing season. In contrast , 
agricultural equipment  store s lose their revenues  by only 30-40 percent from last year, as 
they adapt by  launch ing sales promotion  and cutting costs . Some of them resort to selling  other 
machinery and equipment , such as water pumps, that are currently in  demand.  Overall, income 
of agriculture -related business owners and workers drop s, which will further negatively affect 
consumption.

in-season rice production is at a normal level.

the key  economic activity to slow down . In the provinces where primary  customers  are farmers , 
registration of pickup trucks and motorcycles dropped  by 27 percent and 7 percent, respectively, 
in the first quarter of 2016 relative to the normal year averages (2013 -2014). In addition, 
consumer confidence declined  to a low level , as reflected in the  regional consumer confidence 
index which stayed  below 5 0 and continued to fall  since the beginning  of this year6/. Although 
sales of household consumer goods expanded  in the first quarter of 2016 , that was  mainly 
attributable to sales of necessary goods which  still grew  at a rate close to  a normal year rate, 
whereas sales of unnecessary goods slowed down from  the normal growth  rate. 
The outlook for f arm income and consumption  
 With the impact of the drought moderating , the Committee expect s an improved outlook 
for farm income and  consumption, especially when farmers return to normal activity  once rainfall 
resumes  its normal pattern. In addition, agricultural price s began to trend up  following the 
increases in  global oil and commodity prices . However, farm income and consumption continue 
to be weighed on  by the following factors. First, despite r ising , agricultural prices will not 
return to the high level s as observed in the past  (Chart 4).  Although r ubber price s grow in 
line with  increasing oil prices , together  with the international agreement  to decrease rubber 
exports among major producers  (i.e., 
Thailand, Indonesia , and Malaysia ), 
China’s l ow demand will still exert 
downward pressure on rubber prices. 
Similarly , prices of Thai rice will 
continue to be held down by large 
stocks. Second, d ebt burden of 
farmers remain s high , in part 
because of their borrowing  to sustain  
necessary consumption since the 
drought which started  at the end of 
2014 . Furthermore, the level o f debt 
is likely to trend up, as farmers need 
to borrow more for their consumption 
and farming activities prior to 
obtaining their earnings from the 
upcoming  harvest .                                                      
In summary, although farmers were able to start  grow ing at the end of the second 
quarter and are expected to harvest in the fourth quarter , which is in line with the normal pattern,  
low farm prices and debt repayment will cause farmers’ consumption to remain at a low level 
for a while befo re return ing to normal. The Committee will continue to monitor these  
developments closely.

Billions U.S. dollars
Source: IIF Monthly EM Portfolio Flows Database Volatility in global financial markets subsided at the beginning of the second 
quarter of 2016, compared with early in the year, thanks to reduced concerns over 
China’s financial market risks. But toward the end of the quarter, volatility picked up 
sharply as a result of investors’ portfolio adjustments following the Brexit 
referendum  results . On the domestic fro nt, monetary conditions remained 
accommodative, with money market rates at low levels . Businesses’ costs of debt 
financing remained low overall, despite some increase relative to the previous 
quarter. Meanwhile, baht movements were primarily driven by exte rnal influences.  
 Overall macro -financial stability was not deemed to be a concern , as 
reflected in commercial banks’ high levels of capital buffers and loan loss provisions, 
as well as the corporate sector’s financial strength especially for large corpora tions. 
However, households and corporations’ debt serviceability declined. As a result, the 
loan quality of the banking sector deteriorated, particularly for agricultural 
households, low -income households, as well as small - and medium -sized 
enterprises (SM Es). Amid the prolonged low interest rate environment, the sear ch-
for-yield behavior persisted and seemed poised to increase going forward, although 
there were limited signs of under pricing of risks at the moment.  In addition,  the 
government’s real estate stimulus measures, which ended in April 2016, played a 
key role in expediting customers’ purchases. This, coupled with the reduced number 
of new projects launched by developers, helped mitigate excess supply in the 
property market . Meanwhile, the fiscal position remained sound.  Monetary Policy Report June  2016    33 by market expectations  that the federal funds rate 
would be raised in the June 2016 meeting of the 
Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). Major 
factors  fueling the expectations were  (1) the 
minutes of the  April 20161/ FOMC meeting , which  
expressed confidence in the U.S. economic 
recovery and deemed a policy rate increase as 
appropriate , and (2) U.S. economic data releases, 
such as retail sales and inflation, which turned out 
better than anticipated. Subsequently, market 
sentiments reversed after the release of 
disappointing non -farm payroll employment for May 
20162/ and comments from some FOMC members 
favoring a gradual  normalization path. E xpectations

anticipated.  With regard to the impact of Brexit on 
the Thai economy, the near -term impact was likely 
to be limited , given that most sectors were 
prepared, espe cially financial institutions who se 
foreign exchange positions had been hedged . In 
addition , Thai financial institutions had a limited 
direct exposure to the UK and the EU, with assets 
in these countries accounting for only 1.3 percent of 
total assets. Furthermore, Thailand’s external 
stability remained sound, with international 
reserve s at 3.4 ti mes of short -term external debt , 
which was assessed to be sufficient to provide 
cushion for the impact  of Brexit .   
 With regard to the repercussions  of Brexit  
on the Thai economy  in the period ahead , there 
could be some capital outflows from emerging 
markets, although the impact would be limited given 
foreign investors’ currently reduced exposure  in 
Thai financial markets. Nonetheless, the impact 
from changes i n trade and investment plans by 
businesses in the UK and the EU, coupled with 
potential exits by other EU members, could lead to 
more uncertainties  over the periods ahead. The 
Committee  would  thus remain vigilant and monitor 
future  developments closely.  
 Domestic financial markets  
Short -term money market  rates stayed  
below the policy rate, while government bond yields 
rose from the first quarter of 2016 in almost all 
maturities, thanks to  improved confidence of both 
domestic and foreign investors. However, overall 
bond yields stayed at low levels and edge d lower in 
early June  2016, following market expectations  that 
a policy rate hike by the Federal Reserve would be 
delayed.  
 Monetary Policy Report June  2016    35 Money, bond , and stock markets  
Short -term interest  rates stayed below the 
policy interest rate between April and June 2016 
(Chart 3.3) . Meanwhile , government bond yields 
remained  at low levels , although higher than the 
levels seen at the  end of the first quarter  (Chart 
3.4). This was driven mainly by the anticipation of a 
rate hike by the Federal Re serve in June  2016 , 
following its positive assessment  on e conomic 
recovery  in the US. Furthermore , domestic 
sentiments improved following the release of 
Thailand’s GDP for the first quarter of 2016 t hat 
turned out better than expected . However, Thai 
government bond yields edged lower at the 
beginning of June  2016 , after the US non-farm 
payroll employment figures turned out lower than 
market expectations , causing investors to 
anticipate a delayed polic y rate hike by the Federal 
Reserve.  
Credit spreads between corporate and 
government bond yields were largely stable relative 
to the previous quarter. As a result , businesses’ 
costs of financing through  corporate bonds rose 
along with the increase in gover nment bond yields  
which were used as a benchmark. However, overall 
financing costs remained  below last year’s 
average s (Chart 3.5) . 
The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) 
Index in the second quarter of 2016 edged up 
slightly from the previous quarter (Chart 3.6). 
Major supporting factors were as follows. First, 
foreign investors started to return to the domestic  
equity market and build up positions  gradually, 
thanks  in part  to the  relatively solid  performance of 
listed companies compared with those in regional 
countries, coupled with the ir diversified source s of 
revenues  across do mestic and  global  markets .

declines in the earlier periods. Third, two Thai 
securities were added to the Global MSCI Index in 
May 2016 , which increased foreign investors’ 
demand for Thai equities. Meanwhile,  the Market 
for Alternative Investment (MAI) Index stabilized 
from the previ ous quarter  (Chart 3.7) . Although  
retail investors recorded  net purchases  overall , 
domestic institutional investors had been reducing  
their investment since the beginning of the year.  
Foreign exchange market s 
Movements of regional currencies were 
largely driven by investors’  expectations about  
the timing of a policy rate hike by the Federal 
Reserve and the Brexit referendum results. 
Relative to the end of the first  quarter, the baht 
depreciated against the US dollar  in the second 
quarter  of 2016,  in line  with movements of most 
regional currencies. This was parti cularly the case 
for May, during which investors widely anticipated 
a policy rate hike by the Federal Reserve in June  
2016 . Moreover, the baht also weakened further 
following the release of the press statement of the 
MPC  meeting on May 11, 2016, which expressed a 
concern that the strength of the baht relative to 
certain trading partners’ currencies might not be 
conducive for economic recovery.  
Nonetheless, the  baht and other regional 
currencies then appreciated at the beginning of 
June  2016 , given the anticipation of a delayed r ate 
hike by the Federal Reserve, which followed  the 
release of the US non -farm payroll employment 
figures that turned out lower th an ma rket 
expectations. This prompted some investors to 
return to regional markets, strengthening the baht 
and regional currencies. Some correction was then 
observed after the results of the Brexit referendum. 
This led investors to increase holdings in safe -haven

as well as gold. As of market close on June 24, 2016,  
the baht stood at 35.33 per US dollar, depreciating 
by 0.5 percent from the end of the previous quarter. 
This was in line with the Nominal Effective 
Exchange Rate (NEER) that closed at 104.80, 
depreciating by 0.6 percent from the end of the 
previous quarte r mainly due to baht’s relative 
weakness against the Japanese yen (Chart 3.8 
and 3.9) .  
3.2 Financial institutions  
Private -sector costs of financing  through  
commercial banks edged lower  and deposit rates 
declined marginally . Meanwhile, the private  sector’s 
overall  demand for new financing slowed from the 
fourth quarter of 2015, both from new credits and 
debt financing, in line  with the gradual  economic  
recovery . The outlook of a slowdown in credit growth 
also reduced the need for deposit  mobilization, as 
reflected in the decline in issuance of special 
deposit products.  
Interest rates, credits,  and deposits  
 Costs of funds raised from commercial 
banks declined  in the second quarter  of 2016 , as 
large commercial banks reduced their loan interest 
rates in early April  2016, which prompted medium 
and small banks to follow suit  as well (Table 3.1) . 
This pointed to ample liquidity accumulated in the 
commercial bank system, partly attributable to 
slowing growth of commercial bank credits. While  
the reduction in  loan rates could  relax  monetary 
conditions further and ease the burden of indebted  
businesses to some extent, the benefit on private -
sector demand for new credits  was not likely to be 
significant  given low investment demand overall.

The amount of t otal funds raised by the 
corporate sector  between February and April 
2016 declined from the fourth quarter of 2015 
(Chart 3.10) , with some signs of weaknesses in 
bank loans after the low -interest loan program for 
SMEs ended in January  2016. The decrease  in 
bank loans  was concentrated in the manufacturing 
and real estate sectors. On the other hand, loan 
growth was observed in a limited number of 
industries , namely the electricity production, hotel, 
and telecommunications industri es. Corporate 
loans  were also constrained by strict  credit 
standards imposed by fin ancial institutions, given 
their concerns over econo mic conditions  and the 
deteriorated quality of corporate loans. Meanwhile, 
some businesses appeared to shift  their financ ing 
from bank loans to corporate bonds, especially 
those in the construction mat erial, hotel, food 
products, and  construction sectors . However,

 New loans  to households4/ picked up  
between February and April 2016  relative to the 
fourth quarter of 2015 (Chart 3.11) . Part of the 
increase was supported by temporary factors , 
including (1)  the government’s real estate stimulus 
measures , which ended in April 2016 , and (2) the 
tax-reduction incentives for consumption and 
tourism during Thailand’s New Year festival . In 
addition, the rise in housing and credit card loans 
was also supported by seasonal spending patterns. 
The Credit Conditions S urvey for the first quarte r of 
2016 indicated that financial institutions increased 
their lending standards for households  from the 
previous quarter  due to concerns over economi c 
conditions, borrowers’ credit worthiness, as well as 
the prospect of the housing market.   
Deposits outstanding  at the end of April 
2016 increased from the end of  January , 
attributable to both  household and corporat e 
deposits . However, growth of deposits (including 
bills of exchange, B/E) remained low (Chart 3.12) , 
as the slowdown in both current credit conditions 
and future trend reduced the need for deposit 
mobilization. This was reflected in a continued 
reduction in interest rates on special deposit 
products  (Chart 3.13) . 
Overall, the loan -to-deposit (including 
B/E) ratio declined from the fourth quarter of 2015 
due mainly to slowing growth of new credits  
(Chart 3.14) .

2016Monetary Policy Report June  2016    40 Macro -financial stability  
 Overall macro -financial stability was not 
deemed to be a concern , as reflected in solid 
financial positions of financial institutions and large 
businesses. Nevertheless, loan quality, especially 
those of SMEs and agricultural house holds, 
deteriorated due to both the sluggish economic 
recovery and the impact of the recent drought. 
Meanwhile, the stability of financial institutions 
remained sound. This was because commercial 
banks continued to monitor  credit quality closely 
and hold high levels of loan loss provisions and 
capital buffers, which  were high enough to  provide 
cushion against risks from the deteriorated loan 
quality.  
Commercial banks’ loan quality at the 
end of the first quarter of 2016 deteriorated from 
the end of 2015 in line with sluggish  economic 
recovery.  This was reflected in the ratio of non-
perform ing loans ( NPLs ) to total loans that 
increased from 2.55 percent at the end of 2015 to 
2.64 percent (Chart 3.15) . The increase in the NPL 
ratio of corporate loans was attributab le to loans 
extended to  SMEs, particularly those in the retail -
wholesale sector , which was  affected by the slow 
econom ic recovery. On the other hand,  the NP L 
ratio of consumption loans edged up sl ightly  due to 
the deteriorated quality  of housing and credit card 
loans (Chart 3.16) .  
Despite the deteriorat ion in the  quality 
of commercial bank loans,  the stability of the 
commercial bank system remained sound 
overall . In the recent period s, commercial banks 
continued to monitor loan quality closely and 
maintain sufficiently high levels of capital buffers 
and loan loss provisions, as reflected in the 
actual/regulatory loan loss provision ratio at 160.0 
percent, as well as  the capital adequacy ratio at

required level of 8.5 percent. Looking forward, the 
Committee  would con tinue to monitor the quality of 
credits that would likely worsen  with sluggish 
economic conditions. This was particular ly the case 
for loans to SMEs and consumption loans, which 
could weigh on  profitability  of commercial banks  in 
the period ahead.  
The search -for-yield behavior continued 
to increase  under t he prolonged low interest 
rate environment , but there were no broad -
based  signs of underpricing of risks  at the 
moment . The domestic equity market was still far 
from overheating, as indicated by the tu rnover ratio 
in the SET and the MAI that remained below 
historical averages. While the price -earnings  (P/E) 
ratios for the MAI continued to stay above historical 
averages (Chart 3.17) , risks to the overall stability 
of the financial system were assessed to  be limited, 
as these stocks had small market capitalization and 
investors conducted transactions mostly in cash.   
Regarding  the bond markets , low levels 
of bond yields helped attract the corporate sector to 
rely more on  debt financing. Part of this was the 
issuance of non -rated bonds, with the number of 
issuing companies growing over time (Chart 3.18) . 
Despite the recent growth of non -rated bonds,  
systemic risks were assessed to be limited, as 
non-rated bo nds constituted only a small 
proportion of total corporate bonds outstanding  
and the sales of non -rated bonds were mainly 
restricted to accredited investors.  Nonetheless, it 
remained necessary to ensure that investors 
conduct proper  risk assessments that were in 
alignment with issuing companies ’ financial 
positions and debt serviceability.  
Furthermore , it was also observed that 
investors increased  their holdings of mutual

management of mutual funds in  the first quarter of 
2016, the amount invested increased in almost all 
types of mutual funds , with high growth in deposit -
like funds such as fixed income funds. Growth was  
also observed in riskier asset s, such as domestic 
small -capitalization equities and foreign equities. 
Investment in foreign investment funds (FIFs), in 
particular, stayed elevated (Chart 3.19) . It should 
be noted, however, that FIFs recently  reduced 
investment in countries with low cred it ratings  and 
moved to ward  higher -rated countries such as 
China, the United Arab Emirates , and Qatar, with 
investment mostly in investment -grade bonds.  
As an alternative for those seeking yields 
above  bank deposit rates, savings cooperatives’ 
deposits and shares  started to g ain traction 
among savers, with a sustained growth over the 
recent periods (Chart 3.20) . The main re ason was 
that savings cooperatives’ deposit interest rates 
and dividend yields were higher than those offered 
by commercial banks. It was also  observed that 
cooperatives which received additional  capital s 
exhibited the search -for-yield behavior.  For 
instance, s avings cooperatives invested a larger 
proportion of their assets in debt and equity 
securities with higher risks a nd returns, as  seen in 
the pick -up in debt and equity investments (Chart 
3.21) , though the  shares were still small relative to 
total assets.  
 Given the low interest rate environment, 
investors would likely pursue  higher returns by 
tolerating higher risks. Underpricing of risks 
remained an issue that warranted close monitoring 
in the periods ahead. V ulnerabilities in the financial 
system could accumulate,  as a result of both 
investors’ behaviors mentioned above and 
competition among financial institutions to extend

Committee would continue to monitor the search -
for-yield behavior vigilantly going forward . 
3.3 Non-financial sectors  
Household sector  
Sluggish  economic recovery and elevated 
household debt  relative  to income continued to 
weigh on  households’ debt serviceability . This was 
particularly the case for agricultural and low -income 
households, w hose liquidity tended to be more 
constrained than other groups  of households.  
Sluggish  economic recovery continued 
to weigh on  households’ income and debt 
serviceability. Farm income  continued to edge 
lower due to depressed farm prices and the impact 
from the recent drought, while non -farm income 
remained rather stable (Chart 3.22) . The overall  
slowdown in household inco me, coupled with 
household debt  that had surged in the earlier 
periods, impaired households’ debt serviceability. 
This was reflected in the increase in the NPL ratio 
of consumer loans, which rose to 2.58 percent at 
the end of the first quarter of 2016, mainly due to 
the deteriorated quality of credit card loans.  
According to the Socio -Economic Survey  
(SES), agricultural households had h igher default 
risks compared  with households in other sectors, 
as reflected in  the debt service ratio (DSR) that 
stayed elevated (Chart 3.23) . In addition to this,  
households with income in the lowest quintile and 
those with income in the highest quintile had debt-
to-annual income ratio s that were comparable .

asset ratio, which reflected both households’ debt 
and liquidity, suggested the need to monitor  low-
income households closely, given their high debt 
and relatively low liquidity compared with other 
groups  of households (Chart 3.24) .  
Going forward , key developments to be 
monitored include d (1) the outlook for economic 
recovery , (2) the impact of g overnment stimulus 
measures , and (3) planting  and harvesting after the 
improved rain fall. It remained to be seen how  these 
factors w ould support households’ income , liquidity, 
debt serviceability,  and consumption over the 
period ahead , against the backdrop of  elevated 
household debt that further increased over the 
period of  the recent drought.  
Business sector  
Performance of non -financial  companies 
listed in the SET in the first quarter of 2016 was  
broadly unchanged from the previous year. 
However, debt serviceability of certain groups of 
businesses facing liquidity constraints, especially 
SMEs, could be affected further by the slow 
economic recovery and thus needed to be 
monitored in the period ahea d. 
 Overall performance of businesses was 
broadly unchanged compared with the same 
period of the previous year, but improved from 
the previous quarter. Businesses’ ability to 
generate revenues  and profits impro ved, as 
reflected in the operating profit mar gin (OPM ) and 
the return on assets (ROA) of most businesses that 
rose slightly from the previous year (Chart 3.25) . 
The increased profits in some  sectors resulted from  
effective cost management. For instance, 
businesses in t he petroleum exploration and 
production industry , which  had suffered from the 
decline in  crude oil prices  in earlier periods ,

which translated into  lower  stock loss es. However , 
some  businesses had operating profit margin s that 
were  rather stable  (Chart 3.26) . The real estate  
sector, for instance, saw improved sales on the 
back of  the government’s stimulus measures, even 
though their profit margins remained stable due to 
higher costs  of land and promotion expenses.  
Debt serviceabilit y was healt hy overall. 
Most businesses had adjusted  by managing 
operating costs more effectively, which improve d 
the overall direction of the annualize interest 
coverage ratio (ICR). Despite a decline in some  
sectors  such as the construction and wholesale -
retail sectors , liquidity was ample and the ICR was 
well above the international standard at 1.5. In 
addition , business debt  increased only slightly , with 
the median of the debt to equity (D/E) ratio 
stabiliz ing at the low level of 0.7.  
Although  busin esses’  performance and 
liquidity remained healthy overall, risks in some  
business sectors continued to warrant monitoring . 
Examples included  businesses that were sensitive 
to sl uggish economic recovery , such as small 
businesses with limited financing. Incidentally, 
recent data revealed that  listed companies with 
assets in the lowest two quintiles could be facing  
liquidity constraints (Chart 3.27) . Using these small  
firms to be represen tative of SMEs, which were 
non-listed, it could be implied  that debt 
serviceability of SMEs appeared to deteriorate . 
This was consistent with the NPL ratio of SMEs at 
the end of the first quarter of 2016, which was on 
an upward trend.

The property market  in Bangkok and its 
vicinities improved in the first quarter of 2016  on the 
back of  the government’s r eal estate measures. 
Meanwhile, the slowdown in the number  of new 
project s launched  would help  mitigate risks of 
oversupply in the period ahead .  
The property market in Bangkok and its 
vicinities improved in the first quarter of 2016  
on the back of the government’s real estate 
stimulus measures, which boosted new purchases 
prior to the expiration of the measures in April 2016. 
This was refle cted in the number of ownership 
transfers  and new housing loans that picked up 
sharply  (Chart 3.28) . From the beginning of the 
year, real estate developers had also adjusted  by 
launching fewer  new projects and focusing instead 
on selli ng outstanding units  (Chart 3.29) . 
Altogether, both demand and supply factors  
mentioned above helped reduce excess supply to 
some degree. It should be noted, however, that the 
real estate measures prompted consumers to 
hasten t heir future purchases. Hence, a  possible 
slowdown in future demand would be  an issue to 
be monitored going forward.  
With low interest rate s and ample liquidity 
in the financial system, real estate developers 
seemed poised to shift  from bank loans to other 
means of financing, such as  corporate bonds, 
joint  ventures, and  property funds. In particular, 
the share of non -rated bonds to the total amount 
outstanding had been on the rise (Chart 3.30) . It 
would be  essential  for investors to follow  market  
developments and have a  proper  understanding of 
risks associated with these new forms of investment .

Stability of the fiscal sector was sound , as 
reflected in the public debt to GDP ratio that 
remained below the fiscal sustainability threshold 
and the treasury cash balance that was sufficient to 
meet unexpected fiscal needs.  Nonetheless,  
pressures on fiscal stability would likely increase 
from the additional borrowing needed to cover 
larger budget deficit, the borrowing for investment 
in transportation infrastructure projects, as we ll as 
the future  fiscal burden arising from new stimulus 
measures that had been approved recently.  
Stability of the fiscal sector was sound , 
as reflected in the public debt to GDP ratio that 
remained below the fiscal sustainability threshold of 
60 percent . As of April 2016, the ratio stood at 44.1 
percent, down  slightly from 44.4 percent in 
December 2015 (Chart 3.31) . The decline was due 
to (1) the re demption of matured bonds by the 
Electricity Ge nerating Authority of Thailand , (2) the 
repayment of foreign  debt and the redemption  of 
promissory  notes by the Thai Airways International 
Public Company Limited , and (3) the principal 
repayment by the Bank of Agriculture and 
Agricultural Cooperatives . On the other hand , 
government  borrowing  increased due to the 
borrowing to cover budget deficit and the borrowing 
to conduct debt restructuring for  Thai Kh em K hang 
saving bonds , which were scheduled to mature  on 
June 9, 2016. Meanwhile,  the treasury cash 
balance decreased from the end of the previous 
quarter  but remained sufficient to meet unexpected 
fiscal needs. As of the end of April 2016, the 
treasury cash balance stood at 206 billion baht, 
down from 386 billion baht at the end of December 
2015. The decline in the treasury cash balance was 
due to the increase in regular payments resulting 
from the salary adjustment for  government officials,

expend iture under several  economic stimulus 
measures.  
Over the period ahead, pressures on 
fiscal stability would likely increas e due to  (1) 
the additional borrowing to cover larger budget 
deficit , (2) the  off-budget borrowing  for investment 
in the transportation infrastructure projects  under  
the Urgent Transportation Action Plan , and (3) the 
additional fiscal burden from  quasi -fiscal activities 
that were part of economic stimulus packages. 
These quasi -fiscal obligations included (1) the 
compensation for the reduction in interest income 
to specialized financial institu tions (SFIs) taking 
part in the soft -loan programs  and (2) the 
compensation given to the Thai Credit Guarantee 
Corporation for loan guarantee fees  for SMEs

and for loan guarantee fees under the second 
phase of the guarantee scheme  for micro -
entrepreneurs .
