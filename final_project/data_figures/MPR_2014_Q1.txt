Monetary Policy Report 
 
 
The Monetary Policy Report  is prepared quarterly by staff of the 
Bank of Thailand with the approva l of the Monetary Policy Committee 
(MPC). It serves two purposes: (1) to communicate to the public the 
MPC’s consideration and rationales for the conduct of monetary policy, 
and (2) to present the latest set of economic and inflation forecasts, based 
on which the monetary polic y decisions were made.

Monetary Policy in Thailand  
The Monetary Policy Committee  
Under the Bank of Thailand Act, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) comprise of the 
Governor and two deputy Governors, as well as four distinguished external members  
representing various sectors of the country, with the aim to provide monetary policy decisions 
that are effective and transparent.  
 
The Monetary Policy Objective  
The MPC sets monetary policy with the objective to suppor t sustainable a nd full potential 
economic growth, without causing inflationary problems or economic and financial imbalances 
or bubbles.  
 
The Monetary Policy Target  
On December 4, 2013, the MPC and the Minister of Finance signed a Memorandum of 
Understanding to continue using the quarterly average core inflation with the range of 0.5 -3.0 
percent as monetary policy target for 2014. However, due to the dissolution of parliament on 
December 9, 2013, approval of the proposed target must come from the  new Cabinet which is 
yet to be established. In the meantime, the MPC shall continue to use the old monetary policy 
target until formal approval can be sought.  
 
The Monetary Policy Instrument  
The MPC utilizes the 1 -day bilateral repurchase transaction rate as the key policy rate to 
signal the monetary policy stance.  
 
Evaluating economic conditions and forecasts  
The Bank of Thailand considers information from all sources, the macroeconomic model, data 
in each economic sector, as well as direct opinions from large enterprises and small and 
medium -sized  enterprises from all over the country,  and various financial institutions to ensure 
that economic evaluations and forecasts are accurate and covers all aspects, both in the 
macro and micro levels.   
 
Moneta ry Policy Communication  
Recognizing the importance of Monetary Policy communication to the public, the MPC 
arrange many forms of communication, both in Thai and English, such as (1) organizing a 
press statement at 14.00 hrs. on  the day of the meeting, (2) publishing Minutes of the MPC 
meeting two weeks after the meeting, and (3) publishing the Monetary Policy Report  
every quarter.  Monetary Policy Report  March 2014

1.1 Growth and inflation prospects  
The Thai economy was likely to expand at 
a slow pace during the first half of 2014, while 
inflationary pressure edged up mainly from the 
pass-through of LPG costs to food prices. 
In 2014, the Thai economy was expected 
to expand at a much slower pace than previously projected, especially in 2014 H1. This 
was due to lower-than-expected economic 
momentum in the latter half of 2013, from contractions in domes tic demand and slower-than-
expected export recovery. Mo reover, uncertainty in The Thai economy appeared poised to slowdown in 2014 due to weaker 
domestic demand during the first half of t he year. This was due to the political 
situation in Thailand whic h dented consumer and investor  confidence. Meanwhile, 
exports gradually recovered in line with  improved trading partners’ economies. 
Nevertheless, should the political sit uation subside by mi d-2014, domestic demand 
was expected to pick up and would be the driv er of economic growth together with 
exports. As a consequence, t he Thai economy would resume growing close to its 
normal pace in 2015. Meanwhile, inflationary pressure edged up mainly from the 
pass-through of LPG cost to food prices , while demand pressure softened in line 
with economic conditions. 
In the past three meetings, the MPC voted to reduce the policy rate by 0.25 
percent in the first meeting, hold the policy rate at 2.25 percent per annum in the 
following meeting and then voted to reduce the policy rate by another 0.25 percent 
to stand at 2.00 percent per annum in the latest meeting. The MPC deemed that 
there was room for monetary policy to ease in order to lend more support to the 
economy during the recovery period, while inflationary pressure was not yet a 
concern.

MPR Mar 14 forecast 2    Monetary Policy Report  March 2014  the Thai political situati on which took place since 
end-2013 directly affected public spending and 
further weakened consumer , investor and tourist 
sentiment. As a result, domestic demand in the first half of the year was expected to grow at a slow 
pace. Nevertheless, gradual recovery in exports, 
owing to the pickup in tr ading partners’ economies, 
would be the main engine of growth this year. The 
MPC assessed that Thai economic growth 
should revert to its normal level in 2015 if the political situation subsided by midyear . This 
would be supported by improvements in private 
spending and the tourism industry, the main 
engines of economic gr owth, together with 
continued recovery of the export sector, as well as 
public spending which would pl ay a greater role in 
economic growth (Chart 1.1 and  Table 1.1) .
 
 
       
Risks to the Thai economy stemmed 
from both domestic and external factors . 
Domestic risk factors tilted towards the downside if the political uncertainty pr olong into the latter half of 
2014. This could directly affect public spending by a 
delay of the 2015 budget proc ess, while consumer, 
investor and foreign touris t confidence would also 
be further distressed. At the same time, external 
risk factors also tilted towards the downside, owing to consequences from the Fed’s gradual tapering of Table 1.1 Forecast summary

cause Emerging Market Economies (EMEs) to 
moderate by more than ex pected in the baseline 
assumption used by the MPC. This was in part a result of capital outflow and volatile exchange rates. 
In turn, the risk of economic slowdown in EMEs 
could delay recovery of T hai exports. On the whole, 
the MPC viewed that dow nside risks to economic 
growth remained high. The fan chart for growth was 
thus skewed down throughout  the projection period 
(Chart 1.2) . 
Inflationary pressure edged up from 
higher pass-through of household LPG cost to 
food prices than previously assessed, while 
demand pressure moderated in line with economic conditions.  Steady hikes in household 
LPG price since Sept ember 2013 caused food 
prices to increase signific antly, despite relatively 
stable prices of ot her goods following subdued 
demand pressure from the economic slowdown. 
Inflation projections for both headline and core inflation were thus adjusted up throughout the 
projection period, especially for 2014 (Table 1.1) . 
Furthermore, the MPC assessed that risks to inflation were balanced. Ri sk that inflation could be 
higher than projected st emmed from a higher-than-
assessed pass-through of LPG cost to food prices. Meanwhile, risk that infl ation could be lower than 
assessed could arise fr om lower-than-expected 
domestic demand should the economy grow slower 
than the baseline case (Charts 1.3 and 1.4) .

Domestic demand was poised to grow at a 
slow pace in the first half of the year. Meanwhile, exports would play a greater role as driver of 
growth in line with the pickup in trading partners’ 
economies. Moreover, if the political situation 
subsided within the middle of the year, the Thai 
economy should be able to resume normal growth 
rates in 2015. 
The Thai economy was poised to moderate 
 In 2014, the Thai economy was expected 
to expand at a substantially slower pace than 
last anticipated, in part due to lower-than-previously assessed domestic demand, both 
private and public, in the latter half of 2013. 
Household consumption contracted in 2013 Q3, particularly in durable goods, following gradual 
waning of government stimulus measures and 
acceleration in household debt. Private investment also contracted as businesses postponed 
investments to assess the economic situation. 
Later on, political tension which started to build up since end-October 2013, put a further dent in 
private confidence. As a result, private spending 
recorded a larger contraction in the fourth quarter, which would have a continuous impact during the 
first half of 2014. Moreover, the political situation 
which prolonged and intensified periodically affected the tourism atmosphere, and was 
expected to reduce the number of foreign tourists in 
the first half of this year. 
 With regard to public spending, political 
uncertainty which began after the dissolution of parliament affected public  spending, both budget 
and non-budget, particularly, non-budgetary Monetary Policy Report  March 2014                                                                                           5  expenditures on water management along with 
infrastructure investment  projects, which were 
previously expected to be disbursed this year. 
 Nevertheless, if the political situation 
was resolved by mid-2014, which was the 
baseline assumption used by the MPC, private demand would gradually recover to its normal 
trend in 2015.  Household spending would 
improve in tandem with  higher confidence in 
economic conditions and income. Meanwhile, 
businesses were likely to resume investments, 
especially those that we re aimed to improve 
productivity and replace labor, which had been 
postponed from the previous  1-2 years. For the 
public sector, most of the 2014 budget was expected to be disbursed as usual, although some 
disbursements from the central budget and capital 
expenditure could be somewhat affected. Meanwhile, promulgation of the 2015 budget was 
expected to be delayed by one quarter. The 
tourism industry was poised to recover quickly from the political situati on, similar to previous 
experience in which short recovery period was 
noted. For the export sector, although actual figures for 2013 reflect ed slower-than-expected 
export recovery, this year, the sector should 
benefit more from stronger  economic recovery of 
trading partners and would then take on a greater 
role in supporting economic growth, particularly in 
the latter half of 2014. 
 Weaker-than-expected economic momentum 
towards the end of 2013 (Chart 1.5 and Table 
1.2), coupled with the expected slowdown in 
domestic demand in the first half of 2014 led to 
significant downward adjustments in economic growth projections for 2014 (Table 1.1). For 
2015, the MPC assessed that Thai economic 
growth was likely to resume its normal pace ,

The global economy pi cked up, led by 
major industrialized economies, in particular the 
U.S. and the euro area which broke out of 
recession. Meanwhile, the Chinese economy was poised to moderate from  measures implemented 
to rebalance China's economic structure.   
Thailand’s trading partners’ economies 
improved steadily. Momentum in 2014 remained 
the same as previously evaluated (Chart 1.6). The U.S. economy was ex pected to grow at a 
faster pace than previously  projected, thanks to 
continuous improvement s in domestic demand and 
the labor market. Euro area economies started to 
exhibit positive growth and were expected to 
recover slowly. Overall, Asian economies were expected to grow steadily in line with previous 
projections. Asian econom ies (excluding China) Table 1.2 Forecasts for GDP and components

countries that  benefited from exports which

Meanwhile, the Chinese economy slowed down somewhat due to implement ation of measures to 
reduce overheating in public and private 
investment. 
The U.S. economy was expected to pick up 
(Chart 1.7) . Although financial conditions tightened 
somewhat from the rise in  long-term interest rates 
after the Fed started to unwind its third round of 
quantitative easing (QE3 ) measures, economic 
recovery should not be stalled, thanks to steady 
improvements in U.S. economic fundamentals. 
The U.S. economy was ex pected to expand by 2.8 
and 2.9 percent in 2014 and 2015, respectively. 
This was supported by stronger momentum in 
private consumption fo llowing continuous pickup 
in the labor market and businesses’ stronger 
financial position. In addition, the fiscal drag

1/ On December 18, 2013 the US Congress passed the 
2014 and 2015 budget and eliminated some of the 
spending cuts required by the sequester in the 2014 and 
2015 budget, which increased the central government budget by 45 and 18 billion US dollars, respectively. The 
spending cuts that were eliminated in 2014 and 2015 
would be compensated by (1) an increase in revenue collection from tourism user fees and an increase in 
contribution into the pension fund, and (2) additional 
spending cuts on Medicare, all totaling 85 billion US dollars which would be spread out into the next 10 
years.
 
2/ On February 12, 2014 the US Congress passed a bill to 
suspend the federal debt ceiling until March 15, 2015. 
Within that period, the government would be able to 
borrow money, as appropriate, through the issuance of bonds. Then on March 15, 2015, when the suspension 
ends, the debt ceiling would be set equal to the actual 
debt level on that day.

sovereign debt problem which would take time 
and could weaken investor sentiment periodically. 
Continuous improvem ents in economic 
fundamentals led the Fed to gradually unwind 
QE3 from a monthly purc hase of 85 billion U.S. 
dollars to 75 billion U.S. dollars in January 2014 
and reducing it further to 65 billion U.S. dollars in 
February 2014. The Fed al so signaled that it 
would hold the fed funds ra te at 0-0.25 percent per 
annum if the unemployment  rate remained above 
6.5 percent and inflation was below 2.5 percent. 
In 2014, euro area economies would 
resume positive growth, albeit at a tepid pace (Chart 1.8).  The euro area exhibited a positive 
growth rate in the fourth quarter of last year, with 
recovery expecting to be at a slow pace. Such outlook was supported by lower fiscal drag and 
economic reforms, bot h fiscal and monetary, 
which started to show posit ive results, as well as 
more concrete plans r egarding the establishment 
of the Banking Union which was set up to address 
problems in the banking sector. 
Nevertheless, euro area economies 
remained fragile on the back of weak ec onomic 
fundamentals, including re cord high unemployment 
rates in many countri es and imbalances among 
countries in the group due to differences in the 
level of competitiveness. The main drag on euro 
area economies stemmed from 1) the deleveraging 
process of both private and public sectors; 2) structural problems in m any countries which would 
take time to resolve, su ch as rigid labor markets 
and low competitiveness; and 3) slowdown in credit extension, especially to business sectors 
that had been contracti ng continuously. These 
factors would impede recovery of the private Left axis:           Oct 13 (baseline)     Right axis:    Change in baseline

to remain low, as inflat ion expectations indicated 
that inflation would adj ust towards the central 
bank’s target in the medium-term.  
The Japanese economy was likely to 
lose momentum after the hike in consumption tax (Chart 1.9).  In 2014, the Japanese economy 
was poised to moderate following the hike in 
consumption tax from 5 to  8 percent in April 2014. 
Momentum was likely to accelerate in 2014 Q1 
before the tax hike, but this was expected to lose 
some thrust after the tax measure came into effect. Government stimul us measures could help 
alleviate impacts from t he tax hike, but only to a 
certain degree. Meanwhile, the export sector was expected to pick up in line with trading partners’ 
economic recovery and weak er yen. Nonetheless, 
uncertainties regarding impac ts from the tax hike 
and supporting measures, as well as clarity in the 
economic structural refo rm plan could pose risks 
to economic recovery in Japan, going forward. 
Asian economies (excluding Japan) 
were likely to expand continuously, from 5.5 percent in 2014 to 5.7 percent in 2015, driven 
mainly by the export sector (Chart 1.10). In 
particular, Asian countries (excluding China) would benefit from more broad-based exports 
which recovered in tandem with the global 
economy. Meanwhile, domestic demand in ASEAN economies was expected to moderate somewhat 
owing to private investment as financial institutions   
became more stringent in lending, especially to 
the real estate sector, and from a decline in the 
fiscal deficit.

be the main factor supporting economic growth going forward, domestic demand, in particular 
investment which has a 48 percent share in GDP, 
was poised to weaken. The slowdown was in part a result of the Chinese authorities’ intention to 
rebalance China’s economic structure in order to 
achieve sustainable growth  by reducing reliance 
on investment and increasing t he role of consumption. 
In this regard, the Chi nese government implemented 
measures to reduce the ro le of public investment, 
especially those of lo cal governments and state 
enterprises, as well as  reduce reliance on the 
shadow banking industry which had caused the 
financial sector to become more fragile in past 
periods. Measures to slow down loan growth to 
the real estate sector were also issued.    
Exports would be the main engine of growth 
Exports of goods were likely to recover in 
tandem with trading partner s’ economy. However, 
exports of services were affected by the political 
situation, but should recover quickly. 
Merchandise exports were expected to 
edge up from last year (Table 1.3). Exports 
would increase from the previous year and play  
a greater role in s upporting the economy. The 
recovery in exports was in line with expansions in 
trading partners’ economies, especially G3 
countries. These countries  showed clear signs of 
recovery along with Asian economies which 
exhibited continued growth.  In particular, Thai 
export goods that still bore a competitive edge were likely to expand well, such as automobile 
and parts, electrical app liances, computer and 
parts, processed agricultu ral products and fishery Monetary Policy Report  March 2014                                                                                           11  products. The steady pickup in exports would help 
cushion the slowdown in the Thai economy in the 
first half of 2014. Additionally, clearer signs of 
export recovery in the latter half of 2014 would help boost recovery in private investment and 
speed up production to accommodate higher 
external demand. However, risks to export recovery remained from the shrimp s upply shortage problem 
following the disease out break and deteriorating 
price competitiveness in rice exports. Another risk to export recovery was limitation of the export 
production structure such t hat Thai exporters were 
unable to produce high-tech products to keep pace with changing global demand, for example, 
the fast changing consum ers’ preference from 
personal computers which use hard disk drives to tablets and smart phones which use solid-state 
drives. 
Exports of services in terms of tourist 
revenue were expected to grow at a slower 
pace than previously assessed. The outlook for 
the tourism industry in 2014 was affected by the 
ongoing political situation, in particular during the 
60-day imposition of the Emergency Decree on 
January 22, 2014. This led many foreign 
governments to lift the level of travel warning for 
Thailand. However, t ourist confidence should 
recover quickly after the Emergency Decree was 
lifted, while confidence in  safety should increase 
once the political situat ion subsides. This was 
because Thailand’s touris m industry still possessed 
distinctive strengths and potential. As a result, 
exports of services were likely to accelerate sharply together with ex ports of goods during the 
latter half of this year , and should continue along 
this expansionary trend into 2015. 12    Monetary Policy Report  March 2014  The current account balance3/ was 
likely to be close to balance in 2014, but would 
record a slight deficit in 2015 (Table 1.3). The 
current account balance was poised to improve 
from the 2013 deficit, trendi ng close to balance in 
2014. This was due to the gradual increase in 
exports of goods, while imports contracted  
in tandem with sluggish domestic demand. 
Nevertheless, the curr ent account balance was 
expected to record a s light deficit in 2015 in 
response to steady increases in import demand for 
consumer goods, raw materials and intermediate 
goods, as well as capita l goods and machinery, 
consistent with the reco very in domestic demand. 
 
   
 
  
Private demand should soften in the first 
half of the year 
Private demand was likely to weaken more 
than expected due to a slowdown in household consumption and business investment, but was 
expected to pick up in the latter half of the year 
given that the political situation improves.   
Private consumption in 2014 was likely 
to expand at a considerably lower rate than previously projected , in part due to lower-t han-
expected momentum of private spending in

periods, thanks to governm ent stimulus measures 
along with reconstructi ons and repairs of flood-
related damages, led to  a longer-than-expected 
payback period of durabl e goods consumption. 
Moreover, households becam e more cautious in 
non-durable goods spending on the back of higher debt burden. In addition, t he political situation 
further dented consumers’  confidence in the 
economy and future income during the end of  last year. The MPC assess ed that if the political 
situation subsided by mid- year, private consumption 
would gradually pick up and gain momentum during the end of the year after effects from the 
payback was over
 and the spending environment 
improved. This would be bolstered by improvements 
in income and employment conditions following 
recovery in exports, which in turn would improve 
households’ financial pos ition and strengthen 
consumer confidence.  
Private investment in 2014 was also 
expected to expand at a lower rate than 
projected in the previous Report , particularly 
in the first half of the year. This was partly due 
to investments in 2013 H2 which was much lower 
than previously assessed,  coupled with weaker 
private confidence owing to the prolonged political 
uncertainty since the end of last year. As a result, 
investments in machinery and equipment 
contracted, while manuf acturers delayed new 
investments to assess the economic and political 
situation. In addition, t he construction companies 
deferred investments following a cool down in the real estate market. 
  14    Monetary Policy Report  March 2014  The MPC assessed that private investment 
was likely to recover slowly in the first half of the 
year due to the political  situation which extended 
into 2014 H1 and sluggish recovery in the export sector. Private investment would mainly be for 
necessary replacement  and maintenance of 
machinery and equipment. Meanwhile, investment in construction could al so continue to moderate 
amidst uncertainty in consumers’ purchasing 
decisions. Nonetheless, gi ven that the political 
situation subsides, starti ng from the latter half of 
this year new investments in machinery and 
equipment to enhance produc tivity, as well as 
openings of new constructi on projects could pick 
up speed in accordance with original investment 
plans that had previous ly been postponed. This 
pickup would be supported by improved confidence 
in domestic consumers’ purchasing power and the 
export sector which recovered in line with the global economy, as well as more concrete 
economic management by the government. 
Nevertheless, with regard to private 
investment in the medium - to long-term, the MPC 
viewed that the busine ss sector should give 
greater importance in im provement of production 
potential and enhancement  of production 
technology to keep pace with the changing global 
demand. Moreover, businesses should reduce 
reliance on labor in order to accommodate labor 
shortage and low labor produc tivity problems, as 
well as reduce transportation and logistics costs 
which would require support from the public sector 
in terms of infrastructure investment.

assessment 
Fiscal stimulus declined, in particular 
investment expenditures on large projects. 
Overall, this year’s fiscal stimulus would be similar 
in size to last year’s. 
Fiscal policy in 2015 would continue to 
provide economic stimulus, but at a lesser extent than evaluated in the previous Monetary 
Policy Report  (Chart 1.11). In fiscal year 2014, 
the fiscal deficit was ex pected to stand at 2.2 
percent of GDP, similar to last year’s level. 
The political situati on which stretched into 
2014 after the dissolution of parliament on 
December 9, 2013, directly affected both 
budgetary and non-budgetary spending. The disbursement rate for the 2014 budget was 
expected to stand at 90.5 percent, lower than the 
previous assessment, on the back of lower disbursements from both current and capital 
expenditures. Furthermore, political factors were 
likely to delay the 2015 budget process by one quarter. However, the government should be able 
to expedite budget disbursements for the 
remainder of the fiscal year , given the setup of the 
Budget Disbursement Co mmittee which oversees 
the expedition of budget di sbursements as was 
practised in the past (more details in BOX: 
Dissolution of parliament: the impact on 
budget disbursement) . 
Assumptions on public spending were 
adjusted downwards throughout the projection 
period (Table 1.4) , in particular the central budget 
for emergency and essential projects. With regard 
to non-budgetary expenditures, especially for the 
water management project, disbursements would be possible only for proj ects that required -5-4-3-2-10

authorities, for exampl e, canal dredging and road 
repairs. Meanwhile, only some projects under the 
infrastructure investment  plan were expected to be 
implemented, in particular in vestment projects that 
were ready and continued from the government’s 
original investment pr ojects. Furthermore, the 
political situation also delayed disbursements of 
transfers and allocation of funds to local 
governments, as well as economic spending 
plans. Postponement of some investments by 
state enterprises woul d also take place. 
 
 
     
Inflationary pressure edged up from the 
previous assessment 
Inflation was likely to increase, owing 
largely to the pass-through of household LPG cost to prepared food prices. Meanwhile, other 
commodity prices were expected to remain stable 
given that demand pressure and crude oil prices were poised to decline. 
Food inflation was higher than previously 
projected. The gradual increase in the household 
LPG price since September  2013 of 50 satang per 
kilogram per month led prepared food prices to 
rise steadily since end-2013 to 2014 Q1, and was 
higher than previously assessed. As a result, core 
inflation and headline inflation in the first quarter Table 1.4 Assumptions on public sector expenditure

ahead, prepared food pric es would continue to 
increase in tandem with hikes in the LPG price 
that would continue until September 2014. 
Nevertheless, the extent of pass-through was 
expected to decline from pr evious periods as the 
economic slowdown could make the pass-through of costs to prices more difficult. 
Inflationary pressure from the demand 
side was likely to ease in line with the 
weakening economy.  Softer domestic demand, 
especially during the first hal f of the year following 
high uncertainty in th e economic and political 
situation, coupled with high debt burden in some 
households, led the househol d sector to spend 
more cautiously. The w eakening economy caused 
the negative output gap to increase in the first half 
of the year (Chart 1.12) . However, once the 
economy started to pick up in the latter half of the 
year, the output gap would begin to narrow and 
move closer to zero, which could prompt demand pressure to increase somewhat in 2015. 
Cost pressure from world crude oil and 
non-fuel commodity prices were poised to decline 
in 2014. The MPC assessed that, going forward, 
Dubai crude oil prices  would be lower than 
previously appraised, remaining at 105.0 U.S. 
dollars per barrel throughout the projection period 
(Chart 1.13) . The downward adjustment was 
supported by easing concer ns over short-term 
tightening of oil supply which stemmed from 
unrest in oil producer count ries in the Middle East 
and Africa, such as Syria and Libya, which had 
subsided. Moreover, long-term oil supply was 
expected to increase following higher crude oil production in non-OPEC countries, particularly in 
North America which should be sufficient to 
accommodate recovery in global demand. The MPC thus deemed that supply and demand of -12-10-8-6-4-2024

the projection period. As a result, the high case 
and low case assumptions on the Dubai oil price 
were balanced at half a standard deviation above and below the baseline path. Meanwhile, world 
nonfuel commodity prices declined (Chart 1.14) 
owing mainly to prices of metal and agricultural raw materials
, such as rubber and cotton, which 
fell in line with slower-than-expected recovery in 
global demand, especially fr om China, in the first 
half of the year. At the same time, stocks 
remained high. Meanwhile, prices of food and 
beverages remained elevated due to drought conditions in Brazil. 
For 2014,  domestic fresh food prices 
adjusted up from the previous assumption 
following price increases in meat and agricultural 
products (excluding rice),  especially shrimp price 
which rose higher than expected owing to low 
supply from the disease out break, while external 
demand increased in tandem with global economic recovery. At the same time, the decline 
in rice price this year was consistent with the 
increase in supply due to expedited rice sales from the government’s ri ce pledging scheme. In 
addition, global rice price was likely to decline 
given high world production and stock of rice, such as in Indonesia. For 2015,  the MPC assessed that 
domestic fresh food prices should trend 
downwards following the expected increase in shrimp production after the disease outbreak 
situation improved (Chart 1.15) . 
Furthermore, given the
 government’s 
policy to control domestic energy prices, cost 
pressure from the transport sector was expected to remain low, declining from the 
previous assessment. The MPC maintained the 
assumption of a diesel excise tax exemption throughout the projection period. The MPC also Left axis:           Oct 13 (baseline)   Right axis:     Change in baseline

price for the transport sector, beginning in March 
2014, would be postponed. This was to adhere to 
the decision of the Comm ittee on Energy Policy 
Administration (CEPA) that  future policies would 
be under the discretion of the new government. 
Looking ahead, the MPC assessed that 
risks to inflation would be relatively balanced , 
with upside risk stemming from higher pass-through of household LPG co st to food prices than 
assessed in the baseline case as the gradual hike 
in LPG prices of 50 sat ang per kilogram per month 
would continue until September 2014 along with 
the observation that u nderestimation of pass-
through of LPG cost to food prices had been common in previous periods. On the other hand, 
the downside risk to inflation would stem from 
lower-than-expected demand pressure should the economy slow down by more than projected in the 
baseline case. 
Alternative scenarios 
The MPC appraised that there were 
various scenarios where Thai economic growth 
could deviate from the baseline case. The MPC 
thus took these scenarios into consideration to 
reflect key risk factors on the Thai economy and 
inflationary pressure, going forward. 
Scenario 1: Uncertainty in the domestic 
political situation extended into the latter half 
of 2015. This would affect private and tourist 
confidence, which in tu rn would cause private 
consumption and investment, as well as the 
tourism industry to recover slower than assessed in the baseline case. Moreover, financial positions 
of low income households would be more fragile, 
in particular those with high debt burden. The 2015 budget process could also be delayed by 20    Monetary Policy Report  March 2014  more than one quarter a nd disbursements of the 
government’s infrastructure  investment projects 
could be limited further. Under this scenario, 
Thailand’s economic growth would be lower than assessed in the baseline case throughout the 
projection period.  
Scenario 2: Emerging market economies 
(EMEs) slowed down more than expected, due 
to impacts from the Fed’s QE tapering. Risks 
from QE tapering throughout the year could cause 
capital outflow, as well as weaker and more 
volatile exchange rates. Consequently, EMEs could slow down by more than expected in the 
baseline case. Furthermore, QE tapering could 
also tighten liquidity in financial systems and reduce asset prices in EMEs. Nonetheless, sound 
external stability in T hailand, including high 
international reserves, should help the economy weather direct effects from capital flow volatility 
(more details in BOX: Central banks’ policy 
response to volatility in global financial markets and implications for Thailand) . 
However, Thailand could be faced with indirect 
impacts from an economic slowdown in ASEAN countries and China, th e country’s major trading 
partner which accounted for 38 percent of export 
market in 2013. As a resu lt, export recovery could 
be delayed and Thai economic growth could be 
lower than assessed in the baseline case. 
Scenario 3: The Thai political situation 
subsided earlier than assessed in the baseline 
case.  Under this scenario, private demand should 
start to pick up in the second quarter of this year, 
with respect to improvements in private sector 
confidence and the tour ism industry which 
returned to normal. Consequently, the Thai 
economy would expand sli ghtly higher than the 
baseline case.  Monetary Policy Report  March 2014                                                                                           21  1.3 Monetary policy decision   
 Monetary policy eased further   
In the past three meetings, the MPC voted 
to reduce the policy rate by 0.25 percent in the first 
meeting, hold the policy rate at 2.25 percent per 
annum in the next meeting, and reduce the policy 
rate by another 0.25 percent to stand at 2.00 
percent per annum in the latest meeting. The MPC 
deemed that there was room for monetary policy to 
ease further in order to lend more support to the 
economy during the recovery period which would 
take time.  
 In its meeting on November 27, 2013, the 
MPC assessed that the global economy would 
continue to recover; led by expansions in G3 
countries, especially the U.S. Nevertheless, high uncertainty in the outlook for monetary and fiscal 
policies in the U.S. would continue to weigh on 
global financial market stability. The Chinese economy expanded well across all sectors, while 
regional economies continued to grow gradually. 
Meanwhile, the Thai economy expanded less than expected in 2013 Q3 from both private and public 
spending, while recovery in exports of goods had 
not gained traction. Furthermore, the Thai economy was projected to grow at a slower pace than 
previously assessed on the back of greater 
downside risks which stemmed from further delays in public investment, weakening private confidence 
from the political situation, and exports that had not 
yet recovered fully. Given benign inflation outlook and moderating household credit growth, there was 
room for monetary policy to mitigate downside risks 
to the economy and support economic recovery. The MPC thus voted 6 to 1 to reduce the policy rate 
by 0.25 percent, from 2.50 to 2.25 percent per 22    Monetary Policy Report  March 2014  annum, with one member voted to hold the policy 
rate, deeming current monetary policy stance to 
be sufficiently accommodative.  
 In its subsequent m eeting on January 22, 
2014, the MPC assessed that G3 economies 
showed signs of gradual improvement, led by the U.S. economy which expanded on the back of 
stronger domestic demand. The Chinese economy 
expanded steadily, while exports of Asian economies, particularly in North Asia, began to 
recover. The Thai economy in 2013 Q4 was 
expected to grow less than previously assessed as a result of the ongoing political situation which 
put a dent in private c onfidence, weighing on 
overall outlook for growth. Meanwhile, exports continued to expand at a subdued pace. The MPC 
deemed that the current st ance of monetary policy 
was accommodative and supportive of economic recovery. The ongoing political situation posed 
risks to growth, but sound economic fundamentals 
should help the economy weather these short-
term risks. In addition,  safeguarding financial 
stability remained a co rnerstone for economic 
recovery in the periods ahead. The MPC thus voted 4 to 3 to maintain the policy rate at 2.25 
percent per annum. Three members voted to 
reduce the policy rate by 0.25 percent as they 
viewed that monetary polic y still had room to ease 
in order to guard agains t higher downside risks to 
growth. 
 With regards to the meeting on March 12, 
2014, the MPC assessed that the global economy continued to recover, led by major economies. 
The Chinese economy ex panded steadily, despite 
some signs of moderation in investment. Asian economies, overall, benefit ed from exports. Thai 
economic growth slowed in 2013 Q4 and January 
2014 from contractions in domestic demand, with Monetary Policy Report  March 2014                                                                                           23  private spending taking a hit by weaker private 
confidence. Meanwhile, tourism had begun to 
experience greater impact  from the political 
situation. Going forward,  political uncertainties 
would continue to impede recoveries of private 
consumption and investment. Nonetheless, exports 
of goods should gradually improve on the back of a recovery in major economies, which should 
provide impetus to growth this year. The MPC 
judged that downside risks to growth had risen in the wake of the ongoi ng political situation. 
Although core inflation edged up, it remained 
subdued. The MPC thus vot ed 4 to 3 to reduce the 
policy rate by 0.25 percent, from 2.25 to 2.00 
percent per annum. Three members voted to hold 
the policy rate, viewing that the monetary policy 
stance was already accommodative while the 
main headwinds to growth were not financial in 
nature. Hence monetary policy should be used 
when it would be effective in supporting economic 
recovery.

and implications for Thailand   
After the Fed signaled that 
it would start tapering QE in May 
2013, emerging market economies (EMEs) experienced continuous 
outflows of capital. The capital 
flight was a result of asset sell-offs and the reallocation of funds into 
safe haven assets of major 
industrialized count ries, causing 
EMEs’ currencies to depreciate 
(Chart 1) .  
Nevertheless, starting in 
early 2014, the currencies of EMEs 
started to move in diverse directions as investors began to 
give greater importance to 
economic fundamentals of each country. The ext ent of economic 
fundamental fragility, both domestic 
and external, helped differentiate risks of investi ng between various 
countries’ assets. Thus, countries 
with higher fragility would ultimately experience higher risk of capital 
flight. After studying the latest 
figures of EMEs’ fragile five
1/ and 
some ASEAN countries’ economic 
fundamentals (Chart 2) , the followings 
were found. (1) there were high risks to domestic stability in some 
countries, in particular fiscal 
stability which weakened on the

crisis, especially in South Af rica, India and Argentina. Mor eover, some countries were 
affected by high inflation, particularly in Ar gentina and India. (2) Alt hough external stability had 
improved overall, risks still remained. Most c ountries were able to maintain sufficient 
international reserves to cover short-term ex ternal debt. Nevertheless loss in competitiveness 
and accelerated imports in past periods led to  high current account deficits in Turkey and 
South Africa.        
The difference in economic f undamentals was partly a result  of differences in each 
country’s economic stru cture. For example, Malaysi an and Indian exports which benefited 
from the global economic recovery were im portant factors influencing the increase in 
Malaysia’s current account surplus and the decline in India’s current account deficit. 
Nonetheless, economic stabilit y measures that were gr adually implemented by some 
countries to withstand impacts fr om the Fed’s tapering of QE were also important factors 
which helped boost investors’ confidence and partly helped im prove economic stability, 
resulting in positive impacts  on EMEs’ exchange rates’ dire ctions. Important economic 
stability measures implement ed since 2013 by EMEs can be summarized as follows

countries resolved these problems by increasing the policy in terest rate. Brazil continued to 
raise its policy interest rate gradually sinc e April 2013, while Indonesia and India started 
hiking up their policy interest rates in mid-2013. After the interest rate hikes, downward trends 
of inflation were observed in these countries. At the same ti me, their currencies also became 
more stable. Meanwhile, Turkey and South Afri ca began increasing their policy interest rates 
in early 2014, with the hikes being quite subst antial in size. Nevertheless, impacts of the 
policy interest rate hikes on inflation and capital outflows were not yet clear. 
2. Measures to reduce persistently high fiscal deficits . Malaysia was committed to 
reduce the size of its budget def icit every year, aiming to achieve a balanced budget by 2020. 
In addition, Malaysia also im plemented measures to steadily  reduce public spending, which 
included cutting fuel and electric ity subsidies, terminating sugar subsidies and reducing 
expenditures of government agencies.  Similarly, apart from aimi ng to lower the budget deficit 
in 2015 from that in 2014, authorities in Indi a and Indonesia also impl emented measures to 
reduce public spending, such as cu rbing subsidies on fuel prices. 
3. Measures to cut down the current account deficit  differed between countries, 
depending on the specific c ause of the deficit. For instance,  India implemented measures to 
limit imports of gold due to high gold imports in past periods. In  Indonesia, fuel subsidy cuts 
were not only aimed at reduci ng the budget deficit, but also at cutting down domestic fuel 
usage and fuel imports. Meanwhile, Malaysia also  considered postponing in vestment projects 
with high import share but low economic  impact to curb capital imports.  
From the above experiences, it was observ ed that economic stab ility, both domestic 
and external, were important indicators of ri sk build-up. Countries with stronger economic 
fundamentals or ability to adjust more quickly w ould be able to better withstand impacts from 
external factors. Therefore, EMEs, includi ng Thailand, must maintain strong economic 
fundamentals and take serious steps to prepare t hemselves for adverse impacts in order to 
shore up investors’ confidence and stand ready to cope with vola tility in the global financial 
market which could lead to sudden reversals of capital flows.

2.1 The global economy 
The global economy continued to recover 
in line with development in major industrialized 
economies while exports from Asia and China 
benefited from improvem ent in these large 
economies more visibly.  
During the second half of 2013, the U.S. 
economy recovered strongl y thanks to continuous 
improvement in fundamental s, especially the labor 
and housing markets, despite  uncertainties over 
its monetary and fiscal policies.  
In the second half of 2013, the U.S. 
economy expanded on average by 3.3 percent 
each quarter (qoq, saar), accelerating from the The global economy continued to reco ver in line with development in 
major industrialized econom ies, especially the U. S. where consistent 
improvement in fundamentals was observ ed. Growth in the euro area finally 
returned to positive territory, mainly ow ing to recovery in major economies. 
However, the Japanese ec onomy moderated during 2013 H2 despite accelerated 
spending towards the end of the year in anticipation of an increase in 
consumption tax in 2014 Q2. Meanwhile , the outlook for Asia and China 
continued to be favorable thanks chie fly to improvement in exports. 
The Thai economy in 2013 H2 slowed down from the same period last 
year owing to domestic demand contracti on which stemmed from more cautious 
spending and investment behavio r of the private sector. Domestic demand was 
also affected by the politcal situation c oupled with delays in some parts of public 
investment after the dissolution of par liament. Such development in domestic 
demand coupled with the slow recovery in merchandise exports thus led to 
contraction in manufacturi ng production. In spite of this, tourism remained an 
important driver of growth, leading to  strong expansion in tourism-related 
activities in the trade and service sector.

1/ At the meeting on Decem ber 17–18, 2013, the FOMC 
decided to (1) reduce asset purchase by 10 billion U.S. dollars per month, resulting in a reduction in purchases 
of agency mortgage-backed securities from 40 billion U.S. dollars per month to 35 billion U.S. dollars per 
month, and will add to it s holding of longer-term 
Treasury securities at a pace of $40 billion per month 
rather than $45 billion per m onth; and (2) maintain the 
fed funds rate at 0–0.25 percent per annum where this low 
interest rate environment would be maintained should the unemployment rate conti nue to be higher than 6.5 
percent and inflation does not  exceed 2.5 percent. The 
FOMC also signaled that it w ould maintain the fed funds 
rate at this level even if the unemployment rate moved 
below 6.5 percent, especially if inflation continued to be 
below the 2 percent target.  
2/ On October 17, 2013, the U.S. government agreed to 
extend the time period to pass the temporary budget and 
suspended enforcement of t he requirements pertaining 
to the debt ceiling until January 17 and February 7, 
2014, respectively.  Monetary Policy Report March 2014                      33 The euro area3/ recovered steadily during 
the second half of 2013 and while some 
progresses on fiscal tightening and establishment

be needed for a fully functioning Banking Union to 
be set up. 
During the second half of 2013, the euro 
area continued to improve after pulling out of 
recession in the second quarter (Chart 2.2) . In 
2013 Q3, economic growth was mainly driven by 
domestic demand while exports moderated owing 
to slowdowns in trading partners’ economies, particularly Asian economie s. However, exports 
recovered and became supportive of growth again 
in 2013 Q4, thanks to rising foreign demand. In addition, there were some progresses on 
economic reform and fisca l deficit reduction, 
particularly in Spain where efforts were spent to increase flexibility of t he labor market and reduce 
spending associated with the pension system.  
In this connection, the euro-zone economy 
contracted by 0.4 percent  for the whole year, 
improving from last year  where a contraction of 
0.7 percent was observed.

11 percent, respectively. Meanwhile Greece, Ireland and Portugal together hold 6 perc ent share in the overall 
Eurozone economy.

Q3 Q434                          Monetary Policy Report March 2014  In the second half of 2013, the Japanese 
economy moderated from the previous half 
despite accelerated household spending prior to 
the planned increase in cons umption tax in April 
2014. 
In 2013 Q3, the Japanese economy 
continued to improve (Chart 2.3)  albeit at a slower 
pace compared to the first half of the year. Such 
moderation was due to weakening private consumption following a ccelerated spending in 
prior periods owing to t he government’s stimulus 
measures, uncertainties  surrounding the increase 
in consumption tax along wi th lack of clarity on the 
stimulus package to com pensate the tax increase, 
causing households to  postpone spending to 
future periods. Furthermore, exports also 
contracted following slow downs in Asian trading 
partners’ economies. 
Nonetheless, after the government 
announced an increase in cons umption tax from 5 
percent to 8 percent at  the beginning of 2013 Q4, 
to be implemented in Ap ril 2014, consumption 
accelerated again as c onsumers took advantage 
of the pre-consumption tax period. Moreover, 
manufacturing production and private investment 
also expanded in tandem with rising domestic and foreign demand. 
The Chinese economy was poised to 
continue expanding mainly from improvement in 
exports. Asian economies excluding China also 
continued to grow in line also with exports and strong domestic demand, particularly North Asia. 
In the second half of the year, the Chinese 
economy expanded on average by 7.8 percent, 
accelerating from 7.6 percent in the first half, 
mainly owing to continuous improvement in exports in line with recovery in the global Chart 2.3  Contribution to Japan’s GDP growth

investment, signaled some moderation (Table 2.1) , 
partly due to the authority’ s more cautious stance 
concerning risks in the financial sector and local governments. In this connection, the authority 
stepped up regulation in  various economic 
sectors, for example, (1 ) measures to safeguard 
the real estate sector; (2 ) supervision of lending by 
the shadow banking sector; and (3) credit limits for 
local governments’ asset management companies. 
 
 
    
 
   
 
   
On March 5, 2014, t he Chinese authority 
announced that economic gr owth target for 2014 
would be maintained at 7. 5 percent as was the 
case in 2013. (Table 2.2)  Consumption growth 
target was also maintained at 14.5 percent while 
investment growth target was decreased from 18.0 percent to 17.5 per cent, reflecting the 
authority’s commitment towards rebalancing the 
economy by reducing dependency on investment 
and increasing the role of  consumption on growth. 
In this regard, the gov ernment continued to pay 
attention to both economic reform and growth, resorting to both proactive fiscal policies along 
with prudent monetary policies. Notes:  * From the beginning of the year until present

The economies of Asia excluding China 
continued to improve in t he second half of the year 
(Chart 2.4)  with exports in North Asia recovering 
quicker than those in ASEAN. This observation could be attributed to the fact that North Asia’s 
exports consisted of m edium- and high-tech goods 
as well as products that we re crucial inputs in the 
global supply chains whic h greatly benefited from  
recovery in demand from advanced economies as 
well as China. Dome stic demand that had been 
the main driver of growth in North Asian 
economies also continued to grow strongly while 
that in ASEAN began to show signs of weakness, owing to moderation in fiscal spending in efforts to 
reduce budget deficits, for example, the 
abolishment of oil subsidies in Malaysia and Indonesia. In addition, priv ate investment also 
slowed down in part because financial institutions 
became more stringent in lending to some economic sectors, especially the real estate sector.

China also faced with larger outflows of capital as 
a result of the Fed’s announcement that it might 
begin to reduce asset pur chase known as QE 
tapering, along with si gns of moderation in 
regional economies. In th is connection, foreign 
investors started to sell o ff assets in attempt to 
rebalance the portfolios towards major 
industrialized economies, which subsequently led 
to depreciation of Asian currencies. However, 
Asian currencies regained stability in early 2014, 
in part owing to improvement in economic 
fundamentals as well as c ontinuous implementation 
of macroprudential measures to deal with  
the effect of QE taper ing by some countries.

2.2 The domestic economy  
In the second half of 2013, the Thai 
economy moderated in line with contraction in

demand. Subsequently, m anufacturing production 
contracted. Nonetheless,  the service sector 
continued to grow strongly,  providing an important

was unable to provide compensational effect given 
the sluggish recovery in foreign demand coupled 
with supply constraints in some industries. 
 The service sector  grew by 5.8 percent in 
the second half of 2013 and acted as the main 
driver of economic growth, particularly tourism-
related industries such as transportation and hotel 
and restaurant industries which expanded highly in 2013 Q3 following an increase in the number of 
tourists from all regi ons including Europe, the 
U.S., and East Asia. (Chart 2.7)  Nevertheless, the 
services sector began to moderate in 2013 Q4 in 
line with the tourism se ctor, partly because of a 
decrease in the number of Chinese tours after the 
Chinese authority introduced a law on quality 
control of tour packages  in October. Moreover, 
travelers’ concerns regarding the political 
demonstrations towards t he end of the year also 
heightened, thereby caus ing the number of 
tourists from almost all regions to decline. 
However, the aforement ioned impact was not as 
severe as during the polit ical unrest in 2010 since 
some tourists were able to re-direct travel itineraries to other regi ons of the country more 
easily thanks to increases in air flights.   
The trade sector  moderated during the 
second half of the year ow ing to contraction in 
manufacturing production in some sectors along with slowdown in imports. Moreover, the 
construction sector contra cted by 4.6 percent from 
the same period last year in line with slowdown in real estate activities and contractions in public and 
private investments whic h owed to the economic 
slowdown and delays in the government’s large infrastructure investment projects. However, some 
construction by state enterprises was proceeded

Agricultural production  in the second 
half of 2013 expanded by 1. 3 percent from the 
same period last year (Chart 2.8)  in line with 
production of rice that gr ew well during the end of 
the year from favor able weather conditions 
together with rubber and oil palm production which 
rose from increases in pl antation areas in previous 
periods. At the same time, shrimp production 
improved slowly towards the end of the year as 
shrimp farmers in some areas were able to gradually adjust production process to alleviate 
the impact of the outbreak  of Early Mortality 
Syndrome (EMS).  
Manufacturing  was the main sector which 
was affected by the slowdown in domestic demand. In 2013 H2, manufacturing production 
contracted by 1.7 percent  from the same period 
last year (Chart 2.9) , where contractions were 
observed in both the third and fourth quarters.  
As such, capital utiliz ation declined from 66.6 
percent in 2013 H2 to 63.0 percent. (Chart 2.10)  
Domestic-oriented m anufacturing production 
contracted, particularly that of automobiles and 
electrical appliances owi ng to significant reduction 
in demand for these goods, attributed in part by 
accelerated spending by households and 
businesses in prior periods together with the expiration of the first car tax rebate scheme and 
electrical appliance c oupons. Moreover, increase 
in debt burden and deterioration in consumer and business sentiments owing to  the political situation 
towards the end of 2013 Q4, led households to 
become even more cauti ous in their spending. 
Meanwhile, export-orient ed manufacturing production 
continued to contract in  both quarters, partly due 
to delays in economic recovery in major trading -20020406080

was that there were suppl y constraints in some 
industries, which made businesses unable to fully 
benefit from strong impr ovement in the global 
prospect during 2013 Q4. In particular, the frozen 
shrimp industry was unable to meet the demand 
for exports in spite of gradual improvement in the 
EMS outbreak. Meanwhile, the frozen poultry 
industry could not operate at full capacity given 
that a major producer was unable to completely resume production after facing a liquidity problem. 
The hard disk drive (HDD) industry also faced a 
decrease in global demand as  it could not adjust 
production to deal with changes in consumers’ 
preference. Together, all these factors led to 
persistent contraction in Thai exports. 
Nevertheless, manufac turing production in 
certain industries noted significant recovery in 2013 Q4 following improvement in the global 
outlook, particularly produc tion of electronic tubes 
and parts. Some other industries also benefited from special factors which resulted in production 
increases towards the end of the year, including 
the petroleum industr y in which demand edged up 
as a result of closures of oil refineries for 
maintenance in certain oil-importing countries 
along with increases in domestic oil stocks in accordance with the requi rement of the Energy 
Policy and Planning Office. The HDD industry was 
another example where production increased thanks to requirements of HDDs as inputs for a 
new game console.  
The economic slowdown during the 
second half of the year di d not affect employment 
as reflected by the unem ployment rate which 
continued to stabiliz e at 0.7 percent (Chart 2.11) .

businesses still faced with labor shortage and 
planned to hire more workers, going forward. 
Thus, Thailand’s strong labor sector was expected to help absorb the impact of negative factors to 
private consumption in the periods ahead. 
In the second half of 2013, domestic 
demand contracted from the same period last year 
due to slowdowns in private spending and public investment. Meanwhile, exports improved slowly 
in line with gradual recovery in the global prospect. 
As a result, domestic-oriented manufacturing production decreased from the first half of the year 
while export-oriented manufacturing production 
somewhat edged up slightly at the end of the year. 
Private consumption  contracted from the 
first half of the year (Table 2.3)  in line with 
continuous decrease in demand for durable 
goods, especially automobiles, after some 
consumers had already accelerated this part of household spending in prior periods to take 
advantage of the first car tax rebate scheme. In 
this regard, the afor ementioned accelerated 
spending, the increase in household debt along 
with financial institutions ’ more stringent lending to 
households, caused c onsumers to be more careful 
in their spending whic h ultimately cause 
consumption of non-durabl e goods to slowdown in 
2013 Q3 and to finally contract in 2013 Q4 when consumer confi dence began to deteriorate owing 
to the domestic political situation. (Chart 2.12)

Private investment  also contracted from 
the first half of the year (Chart 2.13)  as investment 
in machinery and equipment declined following accelerated spending in prior periods which owed 
to reconstructions and r epairs after the flood. 
Moreover, contraction in domestic demand, sluggish recovery in exports, along with 
uncertainties from the dom estic political situation 
caused some businesses to postpone investment 
to future periods in order to await greater 
economic and political clarit y. At the same time, 
investment in construction began to exhibit some slowdown in 2013 Q3 after it had accelerated 
highly in the first half of  the year. A contraction 
was later noted in 2013 Q4 owing to the economic slowdown which started to affect consumers’ 
purchasing power, along with  financial institutions’ 
more stringent lending to real estate developers.

Source:  National Economic and Social Development BoardPercentExports  improved slowly in the second 
half of the year thanks to more promising signs of 
recovery in 2013 Q4 after a contraction was 
witnessed in 2013 Q3 as exports of fisheries 
products were affected by a supply shock from 
outbreak of EMS in shrimp . Moreover, recovery in 
demand from major industrialized economies was also concentrated only in  some products which 
were not Thailand’s main export goods, for 
example, electronic goods  such as tablets and 
smart phones, in which T hai manufacturers had 
yet to make technological adjustment to support 
their production and exports. 
In 2013 Q4, prospect for exports began to 
brighten thanks to exports of agricultural products,  
electronics, electrical  appliances, processed 
agricultural products, and petroleum products 
which started to benefit from recovery in major industrialized economies and China more visibly. 
It should be noted that ex ports of services 
remained Thailand’s important source of growth given the continuous incr ease in the number of 
tourists. In this connecti on, annual growth rates in 
the number of tourists r egistered as high as 26.1 
and 10.7 percent in 2013 Q3 and Q4, respectively, 
notwithstanding some slowdown in the last quarter 
of the year due chiefly to a decline in the number of Chinese tourists fo llowing the amendment in 
Chinese law to prohibit below-cost tour packages, 
which resulted in price in creases. Additionally, the 
effect of Thailand’s po litical situation on the 
tourism sector which became more evident 
towards the end of the year  also contributed to the 
slowdown in the number of tourists. (Chart 2.14)

equipment which were in part due to high base 
effects that resulted from  accelerated imports for 
post-flood reconstructions  and repairs in the 
previous year. Imports of non-durable goods also 
contracted along with t hose of durable goods in 
line with weakening pr ivate consumption. 
Public expenditure  played a smaller role 
in contributing to growth compared to previous periods. In 2013 H2, government spending 
moderated from the same period last year (Chart 
2.16)  due to delays in disbursement of capital 
expenditure. Moreover, the impact of the political 
situation together with the dissolution of 
 
parliament at the end of the year also led to delays 
in disbursement of some  parts of the central 
budget along with capital expenditure. Likewise, 
non-budgetary spending was mostly held back. However, disbursement of current expenditure, 
including salaries and purchases of goods and 
services could still be done as usual. Overall 
revenue collection declined from the same period 
last year, particularly excise tax on automobiles 
due to accelerated sales in the previous year owing to the government’s first car tax rebate 
scheme, as well as impor t tax which decreased in 
line with import value.

0.82 percent in 2013 Q4 to  1.13 percent during the 
first two months of 2013. (Chart 2.18)  In this 
regard, 90 percent of the in crease in core inflation 
could be attributed by hi gher prices of prepared 
food, resulting from gradually rising pass-through 
from increases in cost s of LPG and sauces and 
condiments since 2013 Q4.  
Prices of energy accelerated from the 
previous quarter following an upward adjustment 
in the FT for the January – April 2014 round by 5 
satang per unit, along with increases in domestic retail oil prices owing to higher cost of imports, 
resulting from the w eakening baht against U.S. 
dollar. 
Prices of raw food also accelerated from 
the previous quarter. Such development was explained by higher demand for meat consumption 
during the Chinese New Year season coupled with 
a meat supply shortage c aused by severe drought.

the first two months of the year exceeded 
expectation owing to gr eater-than-expected input 
costs that is passed through to prepared food price. Energy prices were also underestimated 
due to higher-than-expected retail oil prices mainly 
attributed to the weak ening baht against U.S.

Production cost conditions During the first two months of 2014, the 
Producer Price Index expanded by 1.2 percent, edging up slightly from 0.4 percent in 2013 Q4 
(Chart 2.19)  in line with rising prices of petroleum 
products which owed to higher  cost of imports that 
resulted from the weakening baht. Nonetheless, 
costs of other raw materials remained stable at 
low levels thanks to absences of pressures on global commodity prices. 
Moreover, the government’s plan to 
steadily increase LPG price to better reflect actual 
cost coupled with an upwar d adjustment in the FT 
following higher import costs of natural gas led to increases in domestic energy costs from 2014 Q4. 
Inflationary pressure in the periods ahead Overall inflationary pressure was not 
expected to raise concern.  Despite some increase 
in cost pressure in line with the upward trend in 
domestic energy prices , domestic demand which 
continued to be weak along with declining inflation 
expectation of business sector would only result in 
minimal pass-through to prices.

costs. Nonetheless, the government’s decision to 
maintain domestic dies el price and postpone LPG 
price hike for the transportation sector for the time being, would help relieve some pressure in the 
short-term. However, if price maintenance was 
lifted, it would pose an important upside risk to 
cost pressure. 
(2) Demand pressure would continue  to 
be low in line with the slowdown in economic 
activities, particularly private consumption and 
investment as bus inesses and households 
remained concerned about  the prospect of 
domestic economic reco very along with the 
persistent political situation.  
(3) Inflation expectati ons were expected to 
stabilize close to recent levels where businesses’ 12-month-ahead inflation expectation in January 
2014 stood at 3.13 percent. (Chart 2.20)  
Concerning the short- term outlook of 
inflation, it was ex pected that both headline 
inflation and core inflati on would continue to rise 
from current levels in line with gradually rising cost 
pressure. Nonetheless, pass-through to prices 
would be limited only to prepared food, judging from its higher-than-expect ed trend during the first 
two months of the year. Moreover, increases in 
prices of other goods and services in the Core 
Consumer Price Index basket were expected to be 
minimal given that overall cost of production still 
remained low. The low cost pressure coupled with short-term demand pressure which was expected 
to remain weak would make it difficult for 
businesses to raise pric es of goods and services 
in periods ahead. 12345

2012 2012 2013 2013 201448 Monetary Policy Report  March 2014  Dissolution of parliament: the impact on budget disbursement  
 The dissolution of parliament on December 9, 2013, followed by an unsuccessful 
attempt at forming a new government raised c oncerns among many about the impact of this 
political deadlock on future budget disbursement. Th is article was aimed at providing clarity 
on such issue as well as analysis of t he extent of potentia l impact as follows. 
 (1) Fiscal year 2014 budget: Most items would be disbursed as usual  but the central 
government budget’s emergency prov ision along with some parts of capital expenditure might 
be affected . 
 Since the Annual Expenditure Budget Ac t B.E. 2557 (2014) was already enacted on 
October 11, 2013, disbursement according to  the Act could theref ore, be done as usual. 
However, because the Constitu tion of the Kingdom of Thail and B.E. 2550 (2007) granted the 
Acting Council of Minister s with only limited power1/, some parts of budget disbursement 
might be affected, including: 
 1. The central budget’s emergency provision . In normal circumstances, the Annual 
Expenditure Budget Act stipulates  an overall amount of budget pr ovision without details of 
individual items whereby any disbursement fr om this provision must be approved by the 
Council of Ministers as necessary on a case by ca se basis. In this case, items that were not 
approved by the Council of Ministers before the dissolution of parliament might not be 
available for disbursement giv en the Acting Council of Minister s’ absence of power to approve 
new budget. An exception, however, could be gr anted with authorizati on from the Election 
Commission of Thailand according to Ar ticle 181(2) of the Constitution. 
 2. Capital expenditure on new investment projects , including additional borrowing 
limits and changes to expenditures formerly appr oved. These items must be approved by the 
                                           
1/ Article 181 of the Constitution of Kingdom of Thail and B.E. 2550 (2007) stipulates  that the outgoing Council 
of Ministers shall remain in office for performing duties until the newly appointed Council of Ministers takes 
office; but, in the case of the vaca tion of office under section 180 (2), the Council of Ministers and Ministers 
may perform duties only to the extent of nece ssity, subject to the following conditions: 
(1) there shall not be taken any act whic h is, in nature, the exercise of  the power to appoint or transfer 
Government officials holding permanent positions or re ceiving permanent salaries or officials of State 
agencies, State enterpris es or undertakings of which the majority  of shares are hel d by the State or 
dismiss such persons from the perfo rmance of duties or from office or  instruct others to perform duties 
in replacement, unless upon prior approval by the Election Commission; 
(2) there shall not be taken any act which has the effect  of approving any disburse ment of reserved funds 
available for cases of emergency or necessity, unl ess upon prior approval by the Election Commission; 
(3) there shall not be taken any act which has the effect  of approving any work or  project or of creating 
binding commitment upon the subs equent Council of Ministers; 
(4) there shall not be any exploitation of State resources or State pers onnel for any act having impacts on 
an election and there shall not be committed any act whic h is, in nature, a violat ion of prohibitions in 
accordance with the rules prescribed by the Election Commission.  Monetary Policy Report  March 2014  49 Council of Ministers prior to disbursement2/. Thus, this part of capital expenditure also might 
not be available for disbursement  given the Acting Council of Mi nisters’ absence of power to 
bind new governments to its commitments accordi ng to Article 181(3) of the Constitution.  
 In this regard, during 
the first four months of fiscal 
year 2014, the government 
already disbursed a total of  
1 trillion baht of budget, 
equivalent to 37.5 percent of 
the total budget, representing a 5.3 percent growth from to 
the same period last year. 
The BOT, therefore, assessed that the government would be able to disburse approximatel y 90.5 percent of the annual 
budget this fiscal year, overall.  
 (2) Fiscal year 2015 budget: issuance of t he Annual Expenditure Budget Act B.E. 
2558 (2015) would likely be delayed though t he budget appropriation framework of the 
previous year could be used in the meantime . 
 In normal budget process, government offices, state enterprises and other 
government agencies prepare spending and invest ment plans according to pre-approved 
guidelines from the Council of Ministers. T he process usually begins one month prior to 
submission of the plans for review. The budget review proc ess is designed to provide a 
thorough, step-by-step examinat ion to ensure that all expendi tures are beneficial for the 
country and includes a review of the strategic plan on budget  allocation prepared by the 
Bureau of the Budget and the Na tional Economic and Social De velopment Board (NESDB), a 
joint review by four major econom ic institutions namely the Mini stry of Finance, the Bureau of 
the Budget, the NESDB and the BOT, and submissi on to Parliament for approval. Once the 
entire process is completed, the budget can then be s ubmitted to His Majesty King Bhumibol

Source: Annual budget calendar, Bureau of the Budget50 Monetary Policy Report  March 2014   Given the current circumstance in wh ich a new government could not be formed 
successfully and the budget process could not o fficially begin, it would be possible that 
enactment of the Annual Expendi ture Budget Act B.E. 2558 (2015) could be delayed or 
unable to meet the budget deadline at the beginning of October. 
 Notwithstanding the potent ial delay of the new budget, provisions under the 
Constitution3/ and the Budget Procedures Act B.E. 2502 (1959) 4/ would make it possible to 
use annual appropriations approved in the previ ous year’s budget in the meantime, as 
follows: 
 1. Current expenditure–according to the appropriations approved in the previous 
year’s budget for salary payments 
 2. Capital expenditure–only items in connec tion to the previous year’s budget 
 3. Subsidies–only items that were always subsidized in the past 
 4. Transfers to local governments–acco rding to the same rules as 1–3 
 Historical records revealed that w henever there was a delay in the budget, 
disbursement would be lower than target. For example, in fiscal years 2007 and 2012, 
announcements of the Annual Ex penditure Budget Act were delayed by 3 and 4 months, 
respectively. Disbursement rates, thus, stood at 93.6 and 90.3 per cent, respectively. 
 
 
 
 In summary, the impact of the dissoluti on of parliament on budget  disbursement for 
fiscal year 2014 was judged to be minimal t hough some parts of the central budget and 
capital expenditure might be affected. However, it was expected that issuance of next fiscal 
year’s budget would be delayed. Nonethele ss the annual appropriation framework approved 
in the previous year’s budget c ould still be used in the meantime.

3.1 Financial markets  
Money market interest rates adjusted 
downwards in tandem with the policy rate while 
movement of government bond yields was volatile 
due to demand for bond investment from both 
domestic and foreign investors that resulted from 
the domestic political si tuation and expectation of 
QE tapering. 
Money and bond markets 
During the second half of 2013, short-term 
money market rates conti nued to stabilize close to 
the policy rate which the MPC decided to maintain 
at 2.50 percent per annum at the July 10, August 
21 and October 16, 2013 m eetings. Then, short-
term money market ra tes adjusted downwards Thailand’s overall economic and financ ial stability continued to be well 
maintained. Money market interest rates moved in synchronization with the policy 
rate. Financial strength of the financial institutions syst em remained sound. 
Meanwhile, non-financial institution sect ors began to be affected by the economic 
slowdown such that households’ debt service burden increased and corporate 
profitability edged down slightly from the first half of the year. Moreover, concerns 
over the Fed’s tapering of Quantitativ e Easing (QE) measur es caused financial 
markets to become highly volatile in 2013 Q4, particularly the equity market. 
Important risks that needed to be moni tored in the periods ahead included 
1) uncertainty in the global economy that  could lead to sudden capital flight and 
financial market volatility; 2) slowdown in  the domestic economy that could affect 
household income and corporate profitabilit y, thereby leading to deteriorating 
debt servicing ability and financial inst itutions’ loan qualit y; and 3) prolonged 
political situation that could put a dent in priv ate sentiment  and households’ 
confidence. 
 52    Monetary Policy Report March 2014  following the MPC’s decis ion to decrease the 
policy rate from 2.50 to 2.25 percent per annum at 
the November 27, 2013 m eeting. At the end of 
2013, the overnight inter bank lending rate and the 
one-month government bond yield stood at 2.15 
and 2.30 percent per annum, respectively. 
During January–March,  2014, short-term 
money market rates remained close to the policy 
rate prior to a downward adjustment in accordance with the MPC’s decision to decrease the policy 
rate again, from 2.25 to 2.00 percent per annum at 
the March 12, 2014 meeting.  In this regard, the 
overnight interbank lending rate edged down to 
1.90 percent per annum on March 13, 2014. The 
one-month government bond yield also declined 
owing to (1) expectation of  policy rate decreases 
at the January and Marc h, 2014 MPC meetings; 
(2) higher demand for bond investment from domestic and foreign investors; and (3) a policy 
rate decrease in March.  As such, the one-month 
government bond yield, t hus, decreased to 2.06 
percent per annum in March 13, 2014. (Chart 3.1) 
During the second half of 2013, short-term 
government bond yields decli ned from the first half 
of the year in line with  direction of the policy 
interest rate and higher demand for bond 
investment from both domestic and foreign investors. Meanwhile, medium- to long-term 
government bond yields were  slightly volatile and 
edged up in tandem with the U.S. treasury yields 
following financial markets’  anticipation of  a 
sooner-than-expected QE tapering by the Fed 
which resulted in asset sell-offs by foreign investors. However, sinc e November, medium- to 
long-term government bond yields somewhat 
trended downwards following the MPC’s decision to decrease the policy ra te on November 27, 2013,

driven by concerns over potential reduction in new 
supply of government  bonds following the 
dissolution of parliament coupled with possible delays in investment in large infrastructure 
development projects.  
From January to March 2014, government 
bond yields became vo latile and adjusted 
downwards overall in tandem with financial 
markets’ expectation of a policy rate decrease by 
the MPC together with higher demand for bond 
investment from domestic investors given their 
preference for safer assets  due to concerns over 
the ongoing economic and polit ical uncertainties. 
Asset sell-offs by forei gn investors slowed down in 
line with greater stabilit y in the global financial 
markets after a period of concerns over fragilities 
in the fundamentals of em erging market economies 
subsided. In this regard,  the MPC’s decision to 
decrease the policy rate  on March 12, 2014 only 
caused government bond yields to decline 
marginally since the decis ion was already priced in 
by most investors. (Chart 3.2)     
Equity market 
 From 2013 Q4 to January 2014, 
movement in the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) index was rather volatile due to both 
domestic and external factors. On  the domestic 
front, there was political uncertainty while on the external front, there was the Fed’s QE tapering 
which affected investors’  confidence, leading to 
continuous asset sell-offs. As  a result, volatility in 
the SET index during 2013 Q4 remained high at 
19.8 percent per year. Meanwhile, the SET index 
also trended downwards c ontinuously to reach a 
new low record of 1,225 points on January 3, 2014

billion baht. (Chart 3.3)   
 Important risks to be monitored in the 
periods ahead included (1) ongoing risk of capital 
flow volatility which could affect Thailand’s equity 
market; and (2)  domestic political uncertainty which could put a dent in in vestors’ confidence. 
Foreign exchange market 
 Since February 2014,  the Thai baht 
resumed stability against the U.S. dollar after a year of volatility due to global financial conditions. 
On March 13, 2014, the Thai baht stood at 32.27 
baht per U.S. dollar, appr eciating from the end of 
2013 by 1.8 percent (Chart 3.4)  owing to (1) 
relatively well contained po litical situation despite 
prolonged conflicts; (2) depr eciation in the U.S. 
dollar following weak outturn in economic data; 
and (3) improvement in Asian economies, which 
led investors to regain confidence and alleviate 
concerns about potential em erging market crisis 
contagion. 
In this regard, factor s that caused the Thai 
baht to depreciate continuous ly during the latter part 
of 2013 included speculat ion on the Fed’s QE 
tapering following announcements of more 
promising economic data, and emerging fragilities in 
emerging market economie s. These two factors 
together led to capital outflows from regional 
economies including Tha iland. Another notable 
factor underlying weakness in the Thai baht was the domestic political situation. 
In February, the Nominal Effective Exchange 
Rate (NEER) registered at 102.35, appreciating 
from last month by 0.6 percent (Chart 3.5)  mainly 
from the strengthening of the Thai baht against the 
Chinese yuan, the U.S. do llar, and the euro. Such 6668707274767880828486

manufacturing sector coupl ed with the euro area’s 
weakening economic outlook  following the decline 
in inflationary pressure. Subsequently, financial markets began to expect fu rther monetary easing 
by the European Central B ank (ECB). Meanwhile, 
the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) stood at 100.07 in January, deprec iating by 1.4 percent 
from the previous month owing to the depreciation 
in the NEER. For 2013 overall, it was found that the NEER and REER both assumed weakening 
trends towards the second half of the year, 
reflecting improvement in Thailand’s price competitiveness compared to trading partners. 
3.2 Financial institutions 
During the second hal f of 2013, deposit 
rates on both normal time deposits and special 
deposit products as we ll as loan rates of 
commercial banks adjusted downwards in line with 
the trend in the policy rate along with waning 
competition for deposits whic h was consistent with 
financial institutions’ plans to reduce lending 
during the economic slowdown.                                          
Interest rates, deposits and credits  
Commercial banks’ interest rates on both 
deposits and loans adjust ed downwards during 
the second half of 2013 following the MPC’s 
decision to decrease the po licy rate in November 
2013. At the end of 2013, interest rates on the 12-
month deposits of the f our largest commercial 
banks1/ averaged at 2.23 percent per annum, 
declinding from 2.40 perc ent per annum recorded 
                                                        
1/BBL, TMB, KBank and SCB  56    Monetary Policy Report March 2014  at the end of the first half of the year. Towards the 
end of the year, many commercial banks and 
Specialized Financial Instit utions (SFIs) also 
reduced interest rates on existing special deposit 
products as a result of  waning competition for 
deposits, which was cons istent with financial 
institutions’ plans to  reduce lending gradually 
during the economic slowdown. 
Meanwhile, the average MLR of the four 
largest commercial banks at the end of 2013 
stood at 6.84 percent per  annum, declining from 
7.00 percent per annum re corded at the end of 
the first half of the year. 
Between January and February 2014, 
many commercial banks continued to reduce 
interest rates on normal time deposits and 
existing special deposit products and refused roll-
overs of products falling due, in line with waning 
competition for deposits. At the end of February 
2014, the interest rate s on the 12-month deposits 
of the four largest commercial banks averaged at 
2.10 percent per annum while the average MLR 
edged up slightly from the end of 2013 to 6.88 
percent per annum owing to the increase in MLR 
by one commercial bank to match the levels of 
the other three, after it  had previously decreased 
its MLR by more than the others.  
Private credits slowed down continuously 
in the second half of the year. At end-December 
2013, private credits expanded by 9.9 percent 
from last year, moderati ng from 12.9 percent at 
the end of the first half of the year (Chart 3.6)  
owing to the slowdown in the economy together 
with financial instituti ons’ more stringent lending 
practice. Consumer credits trended downwards 
partly due to the high level household debt. In 
particular, auto leasing slowed down substantially -505101520

scheme was completed. At the same time, 
corporate credits moderated in line with private 
investment. Moreover, the BOT’s Senior Loan Officer Survey at end-December 2013 revealed 
that commercial banks would raise their lending 
standards further, espec ially for SMEs, auto 
leasing and other personal loans. 
Deposits and bills of exchange (B/E) 
moderated in the second half of the year after high 
acceleration in the first half. At the end of 2013, 
deposits and B/E grew by 7. 5 percent from last 
year, slowing down from 10.4 percent registered 
at the end of the first half. The slowdown was 
observed in deposits of both corporate and households in line with financ ial institutions’ plans 
to reduce lending during the economic slowdown, 
which resulted in waning competition for deposits. 
In addition, given greater interest in savings 
alternatives towards the end of the year, for 
example, mutual f unds and bonds, the Loan to 
Deposit and B/E ratio cont inued to increase from 
95.3 at the end of 2013 Q2 to 96.6 at year-end. 
Looking ahead, it was expec ted that competition 
for deposits would continue to lessen owing to 
various factors, namely fi nancial market conditions, 
corporate bond issuance by the private sector and 
demand for credits, albeit s ubject to the economic 
conditions.  
Stability of financial institutions 
 Stability of financial in stitutions in the 
second half of 2013 remained sound. Commercial 
banks’ profitability decli ned slightly from the 
second quarter owing to a special item arising 
from one commercial bank’s profits from the sale 
of its subsidiary. T he capital adequacy ratio 58    Monetary Policy Report March 2014  remained high. Meanwhile, overall loan quality 
slightly deteriorated due to auto leasing. 
Commercial banks continued to pose 
strong profitability in the second half of 2013 
despite a continuous decreas e in net profit from 
58.1 billion baht at the end of 2013 Q2 to 54.4 and 
50.2 billion baht at the end of 2013 Q3 and Q4, 
respectively. (Table 3.1)  Excluding the special 
item on the sale of a commercial bank’s subsidiary, net profit of commercial banks in 2013 
Q3 would increase by 6.1 billion baht from 2013 
Q2 before decreasing by  4.16 billion baht in 2013 
Q4 owing to rising operating cost along with higher 
provisioning for loss and doubtful loans. Meanwhile, 
commercial banks continued to be well capitalized in spite of a small decr ease in the capital adequacy 
ratio from 16.5 percent in  2013 Q3 to 15.7 percent 
in 2013 Q4. Moreover, overall loan quality remained sound though some deteriora tion in auto leasing 
was observed as reflected by an increase in 
delinquency and NPL ratio fr om 5.2 percent in 
2013 Q2 to 5.4 and 5.7 percent in 2013 Q3 and 
Q4, respectively. In contrast, delinquency and 
NPL ratio of overall private credits remained stable from the first half of t he year at 5.3 percent. (Chart 
3.7) Nonetheless, liquidity tightened slightly in the 
second half of the year as reflected by the ratio  
of Loan to Deposits and B/E that increased 
continuously from 2013 Q2, ow ing to the fact that 
deposits expanded less than credits.    
Looking ahead, factors to keep abreast 
included the impact from the slowdown in the economy along with t he prolonged political 
situation, which could affect  liquidity of the private 
sector and subsequently worsen debt servicing 
ability and loan quality.  051015

Overall stability in non-financial sectors 
was well maintained though risks increased in some sectors, namely household, corporate and 
real estate sectors. Deve lopment in these sectors 
would thus, require close monitoring in the periods 
ahead, especially from the economic slowdown 
which could affect household income and 
corporate profitabiit y and subsequently debt 
servicing ability. Moreover, domestic political 
uncertainty could also undermine private 
sentiment, if problems persisted.  
Household sector  
Overall stability of the household sector 
remained intact thanks to the slowdown in 
household debt. However, the slowing economy 
could potentially affect income and debt servicing 
ability of households, going forward. 
Household income improved as reflected 
by average earnings for both farm and non-farm 
sectors that trended upwards throughout 2013. (Chart 3.8)  Employment conditions remained 
favorable such that the average unemployment 
rate stood at a low level of 0.7 percent in 2013. 
Furthermore, after strong acceleration in prior 
periods, household debt dec lined continuously as 
the first car tax rebate scheme gradually expired and households became more cautious in their 
spending and debt accumulation. Financial 
institutions also adopted mo re stringent practice in 
lending. In this regard,  household debt (financial 
institutions’ loans to households) at the end of 
2013 Q3 expanded by 14.0 percent, slowing down from 15.7 percent in the previous quarter. 
However, growth in household debt still remained 100110120130140150160

competition in the mark et for consumer loans. 
Given the more-than-expec ted slowdown in the 
economy, the ratio of hous ehold debt to GDP thus 
increased slightly, from 79.2 at the end of 2013 Q2 
to 80.1 at the end of 2013 Q3. (Chart 3.9)  In 
addition, household liqui dity also tightened 
somewhat as reflected by  the ratio of financial 
assets to debt of househol ds which continued to 
edge down from the previous quarter to stand at 201.7 at the end of 2013 Q3. (Chart 3.10) 
Debt servicing ab ility of households 
worsened marginally as re flected by an increase 
in delinquency ratio of c onsumer loans from 5.4 
percent at the end of 2013 Q3 to 5.7 percent at 
the end of 2013 Q4, owing ch iefly to auto leasing. 
As a result, household income and debt servicing 
ability would warrant cl ose monitoring in the 
periods ahead, especia lly given households’ 
already high indebtedness that was due to 
accelerated borrowings in previous periods. In this connection, any potentia l negative development 
could therefore lead to instability in the household 
sector, going forward. 
Corporate sector 
The global and domestic economic 
slowdown started to affect corporate profitability 
slightly, in particular, t he manufacturing, wholesale 
and retail sectors, causing some deterioration in 
the overall debt servici ng ability. Nonetheless, 
retained earnings, to certain extent, remained a cushion for negative impact on the corporate 
sector. 
During the second half of 2013, Net Profit 
Margin (NPM) of the corporate sector registered at 
5.9 percent, declining slight ly from 6.3 percent in 
2013 Q2.  (Chart 3.11) Although the domestic 5101520

on the corporate sector, overall stabiity continued 
to be intact with retained earnings, debt servicing 
ability and liquidity remaining sound. The interest coverage ratio increased from 3.1 in 2013 Q2  
(Chart 3.12)  to 4.0 and 4.2 in 2013 Q3 and Q4, 
respectively, partly as a re sult of the slowdown in 
debt accumulation. Meanwhile, the Current Ratio 
(CR) edged up to 1.6 in 2013 Q4. However, closer 
examination revealed that fragilities built up in some sectors in 2013 H2 as a result of the 
economic slowdown, for ex ample, the manufacturing 
and the wholesale and retail sectors, with the latter also being significantly affected by higher 
production costs. In this r egard, the Debt to Equity 
(D/E) ratio of wholesale and retail sector started to climb from 0.8 in 2013 Q2 to 0.9 and 1.0 in 2013 
Q3 and Q4, respectively while the Current Ratio 
deteriorated from 1.5 in 2013 Q3 to 1.3 in 2013 Q4. 
Looking ahead, factors that continued to 
warrant close monitori ng included the impact of 
the economic slowdown which could impair 
corporate profitability, particularly  in small and 
medium enterprises, t hereby deteriorating debt 
servicing ability. 
Real estate sector Stability in the real estate sector remained 
sound overall where markets in Bangkok and vicinities began to cool down in tandem with 
economic development al ong with deteriorated 
consumers’ and businesses’  sentiments resulting 
from the short-term political situation. 
 Overall, real estate market conditions in 
2013 Q4 improved from the previous quarter,

stimulate demand. Howeve r, from December

in prior periods. Factors that contributed to such 
market cooldown were the economic slowdown 
and the domestic political situation which caused 
consumers to postpone pur chasing decisions to 
future periods. Development in new supply was in 
line with demand, in particular, condominiums though supply of low-rise  residential properties 
increased (Chart 3.13)  as developers chose to 
diversify investment given that construction cost of 
low-rise residential properties could be managed 
more easily than condominiums.  
 Overall stability in the real estate sector 
was well maintained. The signal of market 
slowdown led to adjustments by all stakeholders to handle upcoming risks. Consumers were more 
cautious in their s pending as reflected by 
reduction in the proportion of second home mortgages (Chart 3.14).  New launches were 
postponed by developers, especially c ondominiums 
whereby the domestic political uncertainty was also responsible for part of this delay. In addition, 
there were signs of more stringent mortgage 
approvals as reflected by the Debt Service 
Coverage Ratio (DSCR) of 4.8 in January 2014 
which was higher than the av erage of the last five 
years of 4.4. (Chart 3.15) 
 The real estate market slowdown led to 
some easing in price pressure as well as construction cost. In spite of well maintained 
stability overall, a fact or that required close 
monitoring in the next periods included the economic slowdown which could negatively affect 
consumers’ purchasing power and therefore, 
demand for real estate.

Fiscal sector stability continued to be 
sound though public debt to GDP edged up slightly in 2013 Q4. Looking ahead, key risks to 
keep abreast included implem entation of the rice 
mortgage scheme and lower-than-targeted revenue collection in fiscal year 2014. 
Fiscal sector stability continued to be 
sound despite the marginal  increase in public debt 
to GDP in 2013 Q4. As of December 2013, public 
debt to GDP stood at 45.7 percent, rising from 45.5 percent at the end of  the previous quarter. 
(Chart 3.16)  Going forward, key risks to be 
mindful of included (1) the government’s quasi-
fiscal activities, particularly the rice mortgage 
scheme; (2) lower-than-targeted revenue collection 
owing the economic sl owdown; and (3) the 
political situation that if  persisted, could affect 
Thailand’s credit rating, thus causing financing 
costs to hike up.

 66   Monetary Policy Report  March 2014 Developing the new Nominal E ffective Exchange Rate (NEER ) 
The Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER ) and the Real Effective Exchange Rate 
(REER) are two indicators of movement of t he baht compared to trading partners’ currencies, 
which are used to assess the country’s pric e competitiveness along with its impact on the 
overall economy. 
Construction of the NEER1/ to represent movement of the baht compared to other 
currencies according to their relative import ance in terms of trade requires selection of 
countries and assignment of wei ghts to the chosen currencies t hat reflect the structure of 
trade between Thailand and each chos en country.  Additionally, t he weights must be revised 
consistently in order to ensure that the structure of trade can be most accurately proxied in 
each time period.  
The BOT, thus, proceeded to revise the wei ghts used in the constr uction of the NEER 
and REER in order to capture the true structure of trade as follows. 
(1) Used trade data in 2012 instead of 2007 as weights  for the calculations of the 
NEER and REER from 2012 onwards. Given that Thailand’s and the global economies 
became quite stable after the gl obal economic crisis in 2008, it  was assessed that trade data 
in 2012 would be appropriate representati ons of today’s structure of trade. 
(2)  Used 2012 as base year instead of 2007 to ensure consistenc y with year of 
trade data used. 
(3)  Improved data filtering method in the calculation of trade value 
(3.1) Included export and import value of serv ices in the calculation of trade 
weights for Thailand, given that exports of services, parti cularly tourism, became increasingly 
more important to the Thai econom y compared to previous periods.2/ 
(3.2)  Excluded export and import value of gold from Thailand’s trade data since 
gold were more frequently regarded as investm ent goods rather than traded goods, therefore, 
it did not reflect the country’s competitiveness. As a result, si gnificant increases in export and 
import volume of gold in recent periods may, in fact, distort actual structure of trade. 
(3.3)  Excluded data on re-exports and re-imports3/ to avoid double counting.  For 
example, in case of re-exports, if a c ountry was in the trade chain like Hong Kong and 
Singapore, the country at  the beginning of the c hain would be regarded as the true exporter of 
such re-export goods. 
                                                 
1/ For further information, please refer to Focused and Quick (FAQ) No. 86 “Getting to know the NEER” 
(http://www.bot.or.th/Thai/Ec onomicConditions/Publication/ FAQ_documents/ FAQ_86.pdf)   
2/ Nonetheless, data limit ation on the services sector  in other countries made it  impossible to fully include 
such data into the calcul ation of trade weights. 
3/ Reasons for re-import include but would not be limited to  return of faulty goods, recall of cancelled orders, 
payment default or trade barri er in importing countries.   
  
Monetary Policy Report  March 2014  67 (4) For competition in a third market  between Thailand and an oil-exporting 
country, namely Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates, a “zero” weight was assigned  
since Thailand did not compete directly with  these countries in that third market.  
 The revisions outlined above resulted in adj ustments in the number  of countries and 
trade weights of Thailand’s import ant trading partners, as follows. 
 (1) The number of trading partners’ curre ncies in the calculation of the NEER 
increased from 23 to 25 (Table 1)  from the addition of Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia , owing 
to their rising importance in trade which was ex pected to continue in the future. Moreover, 
Canada was removed  from the calculation since the proportion of its trade and extent of 
competition with Thailand declined significantly. In addition, given Estonia’s adoption of the  
euro (making it the 17th country to join the single currency) , the total number of countries that 
were included in the calculations of trade weights increased from 38 to 41 countries.  
  
 
  
 
  
 
 
(2) The weight of each currency was changed. In particular, while China 
received a larger weight, Japan and the eu ro area were assigned smaller weights due 
to their declining roles as Thailand’s trading partners.  This observation was consistent 
with recent dynamics in international trade.  
 The BOT would begin using the new N EER and REER in March 2013 while data 
would be revised backwards to January 2012. The base year would also be changed to 2012, 
which was also the year of data used in the ca lculations of trade wei ghts. Moreover, the BOT 
would revise the weights along wi th calculation methods every th ree years in order to ensure 
that the indicators c ould capture the true structure of tr ade in line with changing international 
trade dynamics.  Comparison of the number of countries 
and currencies included in the calculation of the NEER
