Monetary Policy in Thailand  
Monetary Policy Committee  
Under the Bank of Thailand Act, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC ) comprises the governor 
and two deputy governors, as well as four distinguished external members representing various 
sectors of the economy, with the aim of ensuring  that monetary policy decisions a re effective and 
transparent . 
Monetary Policy Objective   
The MPC implements monetary policy under the flexible inflation targeting regime . While regarding  
medium -term price stability as its primary objective, the MPC also aims at supporting sustainable ,  
full-potential economic growth and preserving financial stability, attributing to long -term price stability  
and economic sustainability  
Monetary Policy Target  
On December  22, 2020, the Cabinet approved the monetary policy target for 202 1, which was 
mutually  agreed between the MPC and the Minister of Finance to set the headline inflation  within 
the range of 1 –3 percent as the target for the medium -term horizon and for 202 1. 
In the event that average headline inflation in the past 12 months or a forecast of av erage 
headline inflation over 12 months ahead breaches the target range, the MPC shall  send an open 
letter to the Minister of Finance to explain  reasons  for the breach of the target range,  together 
with measures taken and estimated time to bring inflation back to the target . In addition, the MPC 
will write an additional open letter to the Minister of Finance every six months if average headline 
inflation based on the above criteria remains outside the target range . 
Monetary Policy Instrument  
The MPC utiliz es the 1 -day bilateral repurchase transaction rate as the policy interest rate to signal  
the monetary policy stance . 
Evaluation of Economic Conditions and Forecasts  
The Bank of Thailand takes into account information from all sources, the macroeconomic mo del, 
data from each economic sector, as well as surveys  of large enterprises, together with  small and 
medium -sized enterprises from all over the country, and various financial institutions  to ensure that 
economic evaluations and forecasts are accurate and cover all aspects, both at the macro and 
micro levels . 
Monetary Policy Communication  
Recognizing the importance of monetary policy communication to the public, the MPC employs  
various  channels of communication, both in Thai and English, such as (1) organi zing a press statement  
at 14 :00 on the day of the Committee meeting, (2) publishing edited minutes of the MPC meeting two 
weeks after the meeting, and (3) publishing the Monetary Policy Report  every quarter

Monetary Policy Conduct in the First Quarter of 2021  
At the meetings on  February 3 and March 24, 2021, the Committee voted unanimously 
to maintain the policy rate at 0 .50 percent . The Committee assessed that the Thai 
economy continued to expand despite the impact from the new wave of COVID -19 infections  
due to less strict  containment measures relative to last year, the timely  implementation of 
fiscal stimulus measures, and exports  recovery  in line with trading partner  economies ’ 
growth . Nevertheless, the economic recovery remained uneven across  economic sectors 
and would be su bject to risks and uncertainties . Main risk factors include  the efficacy and 
distribution of COVID -19 vaccines, the recovery in foreign tourist  figures, and the continuity of  
government measures . The financial system remained sound, but vulnerabilities  increased  in 
the business and household sectors, especially SMEs and low -income households . Headline 
inflation would  return to the target range  around mid -2021 and remain close to the lower 
bound of the target range throughout the forecast period . The Committ ee viewed that the Thai 
economy still needed continued support from the low policy rate;  in addition,  given the risks 
and uncertainties ahead, the Committee viewed that  the limited policy space should be 
preserved for the most appropriate timing to maximiz e policy effectiveness .  
The Committee viewed that the continuity of government measures and policy  
coordination among government agencies would be critical to the economic recovery 
going forward . The government should prepare  measures to provide continued  support to 
the economic  recovery  and to respond to relevant risks  in each period,  together with  devising  
additional  measures for worst -case scenarios as needed . The Committee also saw the need 
to expedite the implementation of the new  financial rehabilita tion measures for businesses 
affected by COVID -19 pandemic proposed by the Bank of Thailand, the Ministry of Finance, 
and other related parties . These measures include the soft loan facility to support viable 
businesses and the asset warehousing program . 
Assessment of the Economic and Financial Outlook as the Basis for Policy Formulation  
1. Global Economy  
The global economic outlook has improved  on account of the large economic  stimulus 
package in the U .S. and a strong recovery in Asia ’s exports . Looking ah ead, the global 
economy would continue to recover on the back of the distribution of COVID -19 vaccines 
that would likely increase  in many  countries, as well as  the support from  ongoing fiscal 
stimulus measures  and accommodative monetary policy . The Committ ee assessed that 
Thailand ’s trading partner economies would grow 5 .5 percent in 2021 and 3 .8 percent  
in 2022 . Meanwhile, the balance of risks was still tilted to the downside overall . Near -term 
risks receded as the U .S. trade policy became more supportive of global trade  and as 
COVID -19 vaccination coverage increased . However, there remained risks stemming from 
the new wave of COVID -19 infections that could be severe and prolonged, as well as  the 
more fragile global financial stability . 
Governments worldwid e continued to implement monetary  and fiscal measures , particularly  
in the U .S. with the recent 1 .9 trillion U .S. dollars fiscal stimulus package . Central banks also  
Monetary Policy Report  March 2021                                                                                                                 6 continued to maintain their accommodative monetary policy by keeping policy rates low as 
well as through quantitative easing . 
2. Financial Conditions and Financial Stability  
Overall financial conditions in Thailand remained accommodative . Short -term interest 
rates in financial markets remained at low  levels consistent with the policy rate . Mean while, 
long-term government bond yields increased in tandem with their U .S. counterparts, which 
rose on account of higher inflation expectations in the U .S., better economic outlook in light 
of the U .S. stimulus package, as well as the U .S. Treasury bond s upply that was expected to 
rise given the stimulus package . Nevertheless, this had limited impact on overall financial 
conditions and financing costs in Thailand  in the recent period . Financial markets  were able 
to adjust accordingly through market mechani sm and function as normal . Benchmark lending 
rates of commercial banks remained at low levels, while new loan rates (NLR) have declined 
across all loan sizes . On exchange rates, the baht against the U .S. dollar and the effective 
exchange rate depreciated f rom the previous quarter due to appreciation of the U .S. dollar 
following the announcement of the large U .S. stimulus package . Despite the pressure on the 
baht having eased as a result of the significant reduction in Thailand ’s current account 
surplus in 2 021, the Committee would closely monitor  developments in the foreign exchange 
market and capital flows and their implications for  the economic recovery going forward, 
together with  assessing  the necessity of additional  appropriate measures, while continue to 
expedite the new FX ecosystem in Thailand . 
The Thai financial system remained vulnerable amid the slow economic recovery  due 
to fragile balance sheets and debt servicing capabilities of households and businesses . 
Looking ahead, the new wave of COVID -19 outbreak  would exacerbate the uneven recovery 
across sectors,  with tourism -related services being most affected . As such, it would be 
necessary to closely monitor balance sheets and debt servicing capability of households and 
businesses going forward .  
3. Economic and Inflation Outlook  
The Thai economy was projected  to expand  3.0 percent in 2021 , which is lower  than the 
previous assessment . The downward revision to the growth forecast was attributable to the 
new wave of COVID -19 infections at the beginning of the year and lower foreign tourist 
figures . Meanwhile, the less restrictive containment measures relative to last year, the 
additional  government measures, and the recovery in merchandise exports in tandem with 
trading partner  economies ’ growth were key  factors supporting Thailand ’s economic growth . 
The Thai economy would grow  4.7 percent in 2022, slightly lower than  the previous 
assessment on account of lower government expenditure  under the fiscal year 2022 annual  
budget . Nevertheless, the anticipated rebound in foreign tourist figures on the back of 
widespread vaccination  in Thailand and abroad would support the return of Thailand ’s GDP 
to the pre -pandemic level in the second half of 2022 . 
The value of Thai merchandise exports was projected to grow by 10 percent in 2021 
and 6 .3 percent in 2022  – an upward revision from the previous assessment . Export 
growth prospects  would be driven by higher export prices following the increase in crude oil 
prices, as well as higher export quantity owing to  trading par tners ’ improved  economic outlooks .  
Monetary Policy Report  March 2021                                                                                                                 7 In particular, the  large U .S. stimulus package would  drive the U .S. economy and would also 
have positive effects on other trading partners .  
Exports of services would continue to fall and recover at a slow pace . The numbe r of 
foreign tourists  was projected to decline to 3 .0 million in 2021 and 21 .5 million in 2022 due to 
the delay in Thailand ’s re-opening  plan to foreign tourists, international travel restrictions 
faced by Chinese tourists, delays in COVID -19 vaccination i n some countries, and the 
mutation of COVID -19 which affected tourism sentiment . 
Current account surplus was projected to decline significantly in 2021 due to high 
import growth . The current account balance was projected to register a surplus of 1 .2 
billion U.S. dollars in 2021, owing to low foreign tourist figures as well as higher import prices 
following the rise in crude oil prices . However, the decline in current account surplus in 2021  
would be partly attributed to temporary factors such as an increase  in gold imports when 
gold prices drop and higher transportation costs from shortage of freight containers . Current 
account balance  would record a  larger  surplus of  approximately  25 billion U .S. dollars 
in 2022 following the recovery in foreign tourist fig ures . 
Private consumption  would expand  more -than -expected  in the near term  but would 
likely be subdued later . Private consumption in the fourth quarter of 2020 turned out 
stronger -than-expected due to (1) car purchases during the end -of-year sales promotio n 
campaigns and  (2) positive effects of additional government measures  in response to  the 
new wave of COVID -19 outbreak . Nevertheless, the recovery in labor income was not yet 
broad -based . Given the fragile balance sheets of households and weak labor marke t, private 
consumption  in the period ahead would likely be subdued . 
Private investment  would recover at a gradual pace . Investment in machinery and equipment  
grew on the back of  international trade and better -than-expected  private consumption . 
Meanwhile,  public-private partnership (PPP) investment projects, particularly in the Eastern 
Economic Corridor (EEC), were progressing  with greater clarity .  
Going forward, Thailand ’s economic outlook would  remain highly uncertain and could 
face downside risks due to the following factors . First, Thailand ’s border  re-opening to 
foreign tourists could delay given the limited progress of COVID -19 vaccination . Second, 
fiscal stimulus could be lower  given  delay  in approval  process for remaining projects under 
the Emergency  Decree which would remain in effect  until the third quarter of 2021 . Third, 
balance sheets of businesses could deteriorate, possibly triggering permanent shutdowns 
and layoffs . This could  leave scarring effects and hinder recovery of businesses and labor 
even after the pandemic subsided . Fourth,  the non-performing loan  ratio in the business and 
household sectors could surge after the phase -out of credit relief measures .  
The Committee assessed the different recovery scenarios for the  Thai economy  which 
would depend largely on the foreign tourist  figures . The assessment based on three 
scenarios  – the base case, the worse case, and the worst case  – indicated that foreign tourist 
figures  in 2021 could be between 0 .1 million  to 3 million, which would result in GDP growth 
ranging from  -1.7 to 3 percent . For 2022, the number of foreign tourists was estimated 
between 0 .1 million to 21 .5 million which would correspond to GDP growth ranging from  -0.3 to 
4.7 percent .  
Monetary Policy Report  March 2021                                                                                                                 8 Headline inflation was projected to be 1 .2 percent in 2021 and 1 .0 percent in 2022 .  
The rise in headline inflation in 2021 would be mainly on account of supply -side factors, 
namely the increase in Dubai crude oil  prices to an average of 60 U .S. dollars per barrel . 
Headline inflation would also spike tempo rarily in the second quarter of 2021 due to the low -
base effect as Dubai crude oil  prices were low at about 30 U .S. dollars per barrel  in the same 
period last year . Core inflation projections were largely unchanged at 0 .3 percent in 2021 and 
0.4 percent in  2022 . The Committee assessed that headline inflation would return to the target 
range  around mid-2021 and would remain close to the lower bound of the target throughout the 
forecast period .

The global economic activities had obviously recovered, supported by the stimulus package  in 
the U .S. and continued recovery in exports . In the near -term, Thailand ’s trading partner 
economies would be affected by the new wave of COVID -19 infections to some degree, 
although th is would not affect the overall outlook by a significant margin . 
In the fourth quarter of 2020,  major advanced economies contracted less than 
expected . Economic growth in the U .S. was stronger than expected, owing to the implementation  
of stimulus measures  such as  unemployment benefits . The euro area and Japanese 
economies contracted less than previously assessed due to the limited impact of containment  
measures on domestic demand, and strong export growth . 
Looking ahead, major advanced 
economies were e xpected to register 
stronger growth . While the new wave of 
COVID -19 infections has some impact on 
economic activities in the near term, the 
overall outlook has improved thanks to the 
increase in COVID -19 vaccine distribution in 
many countries and the gradu al relaxation of 
containment measures . Additionally, the large 
economic stimulus package in the U .S. that 
was recently announced in March 2021  
(totaling 1 .9 U.S. dollars1/) would underpin a 
stronger economic recovery in the U .S. and 
support the recovery in  global exports . However , 
hindering factors in the period ahead include 
(1) the new wave of infections and mutation 
of COVID -19 which could push back the 
relaxation  of containment measures; (2) the 
slow recovery in labor income, especially in 
the service s ector, despite the continuous  
government measures having helped to sustain  
hiring to some extent (Chart 1 .1); and (3) 
the delayed implementation of travel bubbles 
between countries or designated cities,  which 
slowed down the recovery for tourism -related 
businesses and prolong the existence of 
excess capacity . Meanwhile, the manufacturing sector would continue to recover (Chart 1 .2), 
although capacity utilization is still below pre -pandemic levels given that global demand has  
not fully recovered .  
                                                             
1/  Key measures include (1) direct stimulus payments of 140 0 U.S. dollar per person (2) extension of the weekly 
unemployment benefits payout of 300 U .S. dollar (3) additional budget allocation to local governments (4) 
funding assistance to support school reopening and education (5) additional budget for COVID -19 testing and 
vaccination, and public health

recovery in exports following the relaxation of containment measures in trading partner 
countries and the positive effects from a stronger global economic recovery .  
In the fourth qua rter of 2020, the Chinese economy continued to expand from 
the previous quarter driven by stronger exports as external demand recovers following the 
relaxation of containment measures, especially demand for electronic goods and medical 
equipment which incr eased due to the COVID -19 pandemic . Looking ahead, the Chinese 
economy would continue to expand despite some slowdown in the beginning of 2021 
due to the new wave of COVID -19 infections  among trading partners . Private consumption  
would continue to grow alo ngside the gradual improvements in employment and income . 
Private investment would also continue to expand, especially in the manufacturing sector . 
Meanwhile, exports would see a strong expansion supported by the large stimulus package 
in the U .S. and the gradual relaxation of containment measures in many countries .    
Asian economies (excluding Japan and China ) registered a smaller contraction 
in the fourth quarter of 2020  as exports continue to grow in tandem with the recovery in 
global demand, following  the relaxation  
of containment measures (Chart 1 .3). 
However, private expenditure was   
still gradually recovering as the 
containment measures in some 
countries were still holding back the 
recovery in domestic demand . In 
the period ahead, Asian economies 
were expected to see stronger 
growth driven by (1) merchandise 
exports growth supported by the 
large stimulus package in the U .S. 
and (2) the gradual relaxation of 
measures to contain the new wave 
of COVID -19 and the gradual increase  
in vaccination coverage .   
Governments worldwide  continued to implement monetary policy and fiscal measures to 
alleviate  the impact from the COVID -19 outbreak .  
Governments in many countries deployed additional fiscal stimulus  to alleviate 
the economic impact of the COVID -19 pand emic . This includes the U .S.’s stimulus package 
totaling 1 .9 trillion U .S. dollars (approximately 8 .7 percent of GDP ), the UK ’s [Three -Point 
Plan] totaling 65 billion British pounds  (approximately 3 .2 percent of GDP ), Hong Kong ’s 
relief package totaling 12 0 billion Hong Kong dollars  (approximately 4 .2 percent of GDP ), 
and the euro area ’s Recovery and Resilience Facility totaling 672 .5 billion euros .  
Central banks in major advanced economies continued to maintain accommodative  
monetary policy, including bot h low policy interest rates and  quantitative easing. The 
Federal Reserve (Fed) continued to purchase treasury bonds and mortgage -back securities 
under the Large -Scale Asset Purchase program . The European Central Bank (ECB) continued

Refinanc ing Operations (TLRO III ) which is set to end in June 2022; and (3) the Pandemic 
Emergency Longer -Term Refinancing Operations (PELTROs ) to provide liquidity support for 
financial institutions . The ECB also continued to purchase bonds under its Asset Purcha se 
Program (APP) in the amount of 20 billion euros per month . The Bank of Japan (BOJ) continued 
to implement Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing with Yield Curve Control although 
the operational parameters have been adjusted for better effectivene ss and sustainability . 
Adjustments include (1) establishing the new Interest Scheme to Promote Lending which applies 
fixed interest rates on current account balances to financial institutions that borrow funds from 
the BOJ to finance  their lending activiti es in order to mitigate the impact of future policy rate cuts 
on financial institutions; (2) allowing the 10 -year Japanese Government Bond (JGB) to fluctuate 
within the 0±0 .25 percent range; and  (3) making permanent the upper limits on purchases of 
ETFs (12 trillion yen ) and J -REITs (180 billion yen ) which were originally set as temporary 
measures in response to the COVID -19 pandemic .  
Regional central banks maintained an accommodative monetary policy . Most 
central banks kept their policy rates at low level s, while Bank Indonesia (BI) had cut its policy 
rate further and continued to purchase government bonds in the primary market (direct  
financing ) to accommodate Indonesia ’s large fiscal deficit .  
The growth projections for Thailand ’s trading partners were r evised up throughout the 
forecast period, but the balance of risks remained tilted to the downside  overall .  
Trading partner economies were projected to see higher growth in 2021 and 2022 than 
previously assessed in the Monetary Policy Report . Major advan ced and Asian economies 
were expected to grow stronger than previously assessed, mainly on account of the large fiscal 
stimulus package in the U .S. as well as the continued recovery in exports . The Committee thus 
revised up the growth forecasts for trading  partner economies to 5 .5 percent in 2021 and 
3.8 percent in 2022  (Table 1 .1).

tilted to the downside . Near -term risks receded as the U .S. foreign trade policy became 
more supportive of global trade under the Biden administration . Going forward, risks 
pertaining the outbreak of COVID -19 would gradually recede as vaccination coverage 
increases rapidly across many countries . However, there remained pockets of risks 
stemming from (1) the new wave of COVID -19 infections in many countries that could be 
severe and prolonged; and (2) the more fragile global financial stability whereby the private 
sector and governments of some countries might face higher default risks or could hav e their 
credit ratings downgraded . At the same time, trading partner economies could still 
outperform the baseline forecasts  if (1) the COVID -19 pandemic subsides and vaccination 
is timely, and (2) fiscal stimulus measures of various countries provided a l arger -than-expected  
boost to economic growth .  
There were capital outflows from emerging market economies towards the end of the 
first quarter of 2021 as government bond yields in most countries rose in tandem with  
U.S. Treasury yields .  
In the beginning of 2021, there were continued capital inflows into bond and 
equity markets of emerging market economies since the end of 2020 . Key factors 
underpinning improved investor confidence at the time were the vaccination progress in 
many countries and greater cla rity regarding Joe Biden as the next U .S. President .  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
However, there were capital outflows from EMs towards the end of the first 
quarter of 2021, especially from the bond market as government bond yields in many 
countries rose in tandem with U.S.  Treasury yields (Chart 1 .4). The MOVE index2/ spiked 
around the end of February, reflecting the increased volatility in U .S. Treasury yields .

to a state of reflation with rising inflation expectations and rising prices of risky assets such as 
equity, oil, and commodities . Investors were concerned that the Fed might raise the Fede ral 
Funds Rate sooner  than expected to rein in inflation, and that the issuance of U .S. Treasury 
bonds would accelerate with increased financing demand to boost economic growth . This led 
to an increase in the long -term U .S. Treasury yields, which also prom pted increases in 
governmen t bond yields globally . As a result, foreign investors started to scale back their 
investments in EMs given that EM bond prices would likely decline due to the sharp rise in 
government bond yields, and that EM currencies would li kely depreciate .  
Looking ahead, capital flows in EMs would likely be highly volatile . This depends  
on a number of factors . First, the direction of monetary policy in the U .S. and other major 
advanced economies  in the period ahead . Second, the recovery pat h of the global economy 
and the implications for inflationary pressure, particularly the  developments in the U .S. labor 
market . Third, the global COVID -19 vaccination progress . Fourth, the fragility in global financial  
stability from elevated debt levels on a global scale as the private sector and governments in 
some countries could default on their debt . 
Dubai crude oil prices increased in the first quarter of 2021 due to a tightening in the 
supply of oil following production cuts by Saudi Arabia, oil pr oduction in the U .S. being 
impacted temporary by the severe winter storm, extension of production cuts by OPEC + 
countries, and increased oil demand from the improved global economic outlook .     
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Dubai crude oil prices increased in the first quart er of 2021 (Chart 1 .5) due to a 
tightening in the supply of oil . This tightening can be attributed to (1) Saudi Arabia further 
cutting oil production by 1 million barrel per day on top of OPEC members and allies to cut 
production between February to April 2021 to restore oil market balance; (2) the temporary 
decrease in oil supply from the U.S. due to the severe winter storm which caused a 
widespread power outage and impacted oil production; and (3) OPEC members and allies 
extended their agreement to cut pr oduction by 7 .2 million barrel per day by one month

Monetary Policy Report  March 2021                                                                                                                 14 through to April 2021 . Moreover, the increase in Dubai crude oil prices was also driven by 
increased oil demand as prospects for a global economic recovery improved following the 
announcement of the large  fiscal stimulus package in the U .S.  
The Committee revised up Dubai crude oil prices assumptions in 2021 and 
2022 from 47.3 and 51.5 U.S. dollars per barrel to 60.0 and 62.5 U.S. dollars per barrel, 
respectively . The upward revision was attributed to the global economic recovery prospect 
boosted by stimulus measures in the U .S., oil production cuts by OPEC members and allies, 
and a prospective slowdown in investment by U .S. oil producers that would result in a 
slower -than-expected increase in shale oil pro duction . Nevertheless, U .S. oil producers 
might ramp up oil production if the increase in global oil prices continues . Meanwhile, global oil 
supply could also pick up after production cuts by OPEC members and allies come to an end .  
Risks to the outlook fo r Dubai crude oil prices became balanced between the 
downside and the upside . Downside risks include  (1) prolonged outbreak of COVID -19 and 
delays in vaccination that lead to a decline in demand for oil; (2) escalation of US -China trade 
tensions; and (3) OPEC members and allies failing to meet their production cut agreements . 
Upside risks include  (1) geopolitical risks becoming more intensified; (2) decreased fossil fuel 
subsidies in the U .S. resulting in higher production costs for U .S. oil producers .

2.1 Recent developments  
The Thai economy continued to recover in the fourth quarter of 2020 thanks to the support  
from government measures . The new wave of COVID -19 infections had limited impact 
on economic activities in the first quarter of 2021 .   
The Thai economy contracted 4 .2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2021 – an 
improvement from the 6 .4 percent contraction in the previous quarter . Private consumption  
growth turned slightly positive with the support from governme nt measures and the gradual 
improvement in  household purchasing power . Public consumption remained an important 
growth driver, although public investment slowed down somewhat due to the delayed enactment 
of the Annual Budget Expenditure Act for the fiscal year 2021 . Merchandise exports improved  
in tandem with the recovery in trading partner economies, especially exports of electronics 
and electrical appliances which benefited from the work -from-home arrangements being 
widely implemented . Growth in exports o f automobiles resumed owing to the relaxation of 
containment measures in many countries and pent -up demand from the prior period . Private 
investment registered a smaller contraction thanks to stronger demand and  improved business 
confidence . Meanwhile, exp orts of services continued to see large contractions due to 
international travel restrictions, although the re -opening of the country to foreigners who hold 
the Special Tourists Visa (STV) has been commenced since October 2020 . 
Economic indicators reflecte d a clearer impact of the new wave of COVID -19 
infections on the Thai economy in the first quarter of 2021. Nonetheless, the overall 
impact was not as severe as the first wave . Private consumption contracted on account of 
declining consumer confidence and household purchasing power as well as reduced economic  
activities following stringent containment measures in some areas . Nevertheless,  the 
continued government measures helped shore up purchasing power to some extent . Private 
investment declined as busine ss confidence faltered following the new wave of infections . 
Meanwhile, public expenditure increased, in part due to the postponement of some budget 
disbursement from the fiscal year 2020 to the fiscal year 2021 . Merchandise  exports 
continued to recover in  tandem with trading partners ’ growth, with exports of automobiles 
accelerating this quarter in light of pending orders from December 2020 . Export of services 
continued to register  large contractions due to international travel restrictions and the more 
severe COVID -19 outbreaks in many countries . 
Household income remained fragile  due to the new wave of COVID -19 infections and 
the drought .  
Household income remained fragile overall . Non-farm income was affected by 
the new wave of COVID -19, although to a les ser extent compared to the first wave .  
The number of employed persons, as reflected by the number of employees who contribute 
to social security system (Section 33), remained lower than the pre -pandemic  level.  
The number of initial jobless claims by insu red persons (Section 38 ) increased since January 
2021, with most claims being made by workers that  were laid off (Chart 2 .1).    
Monetary Policy Report  March 2021                                                                                                                 16  Farm income growth slowed as agricultural output fell due to the  drought,  especially 
sugarcane and rice . Meanwhile, agricultura l prices increased  from rising sugarcane and rubber 
prices . The rise in sugarcane price was attributed to lower  crop output, while the rise in rubber 
prices was attributed to increased demand for rubber gloves . 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Headline inflation was more negati ve than the previous quarter mainly due to the decline 
in fresh food prices . Core inflation also decreased on account of government measures 
to lower the cost of living . 
Headline inflation  in the first two months of the first quarter of 2021 averaged -0.76 
percent, more negative than -0.40 percent in the previous quarter (Chart 2 .2). This was 
largely attributed to the contraction in fresh food prices as vegetable prices fell due to higher 
crop output . Meanwhile, energy prices registered a smaller contracti on compared to the 
previous quarter as retail oil prices increased in line with global crude oil prices . 
Nevertheless, the government ’s measure to reduce electricity bills  to lower the cost of living 
during the new wave of COVID -19 infections had curbed th e increase in energy prices .

percent, down from 0 .19 percent in the previous quarter . Core inflation in the non -food 
category decreased in line with prices of h ousing and furnishing, which declined due to the 
government ’s measure to reduce water bills to lower the cost of living during the new wave 
of COVID -19 infections  (Chart 2 .3). Core inflation in the food category increased slightly 
from higher prices of sea soning and condiments  (Chart 2 .4).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Both the short -term and long -term inflation expectations remained within the 
target range . The short -term (one-year ahead ) inflation expectations according to the 
survey of professional forecasters in March 2021 was 1 .1 percent, while inflation expectations  
based on the survey of businesses in February 2021 was 1 .5 percent . The long -term  
(five-year ahead ) inflation expectations based on the survey of professional forecasters in 
October 2020 was 1 .7 percent (Chart  2.5).

low despite the sharp rise in long -term government bond yields in February and March 
2021 . Meanwhile, corporate credit spreads continued to decline .  
During the first quarter of 2021, 
the overall cost of financing remained 
accommodative, as indicated by the real 
policy rate in Thailand which remained low 
and consistent with those in other EMs 
(Chart 2 .6). Short -term interest rates in 
financial market s remained at low levels 
close to  the policy rate . Meanwhile , 
short -term government bond yields 
rebounded  to levels close to the policy 
rate (Chart 2 .7). This was on account of 
increased issuance of short -term government  
bonds consistent with higher bond d emand 
from domestic  investors following a period 
of low bond supply in the fourth quarter  
of 2020 . Medium -term  and long -term  
government  bond yields  rose sharply  
in February and March 2021 (Chart 2 .8) 
driven mainly by external factors.  The 
movements of Tha i bond yields were in 
line with the sharp rise in U .S. Treasury 
yields following the announcement of the 
large stimulus package in U .S. which 
would likely result in higher issuance of 
U.S. Treasury bonds to finance the large 
spending needs . The rise in bon d yields 
was also driven by the recovery outlook 
of the U.S. economy and improvement in 
its COVID -19 situation, which resulted in 
higher inflation expectations in the U .S. 
Nevertheless, the increase in long -term 
Thai government bond yields had limited  
impa ct on bond market functioning and 
overall  financial conditions in Thailand . 
Most recently, long -term Thai government 
bond yields have declined and exhibited 
less co -movement with U .S. Treasury yields . 
Institutional investors were also drawn by 
higher yield s and resumed purchase of 
long-term Thai government bonds .

at low levels  as reflected by the benchmark lending rates of five largest commercial banks 
which were unchanged (Chart 2.9). Since the end of last year, new loan rates (NLR3/) have 
declined to 3 .45 percent in January 2021 as the interest rate on new loans declined across 
all contract sizes  (Chart 2 .10). Meanwhile, deposit rates  remained low (Chart 2 .11).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The credit spread between corporate and government bonds  (corporate credit 
spread ) with 1 -3 year maturity (common maturity among corporate bonds issued in recent 
times ) and credit rating of A  or higher  continued to see a gradual decline (Chart 2 .12). In 
particular, the corporate credit spread for AAA -rated bonds declined to pre -pandemic levels . 
However, the corporate credit spread of those with credit rating of BBB remained high as 
investors were still cautious about investing in corporate bonds with high er risk ratings .

Monetary Policy Report  March 2021                                                                                                                 20 Private sector financing expanded on the back of business credit, while growth  in 
household credit was stable .  
In January 2021, private sector 
loans and bond issuances (private 
credit )4/ grew 4 .7 percent  from the same 
period last yea r (Chart 2 .13) primarily on 
account of business credit . Business 
loans and corporate bond issuances 
grew 5 .1 percent  from the same period 
last year (Chart 2 .14). This was driven by 
the acceleration in business credit in 
December 2020  as large corporates bo rrowed  
from abroad to  finance acquisitions, as well 
as borrowings by commercial businesses . 
However, business credit slowed down  
slightly in January 2021 as commercial 
banks reduced lending to manufacturing 
businesses . Meanwhile, growth  in corporate 
bond i ssuance in January 2021 was at a 
historical low5/ of 2.4 percent . This could 
be attributed to the ample liquidity in the 
financial system, low interest rates offered 
by financial institutions, and high corporate 
credit spread for lower -rated bonds, which 
drove businesses to obtain financing through 
financial institutions . Household  credit 
expanded 4 .3 percent in January 2021  
from the same period last year, close to 
the growth in the fourth quarter of 2020 . 
This was attributed to loans from specialize d 
finan cial institutions as their soft loan 
programs  were extended to help alleviate 
the impact of the new wave of COVID -19.  
For the first quarter of 2021 , 
businesses and households would likely 
need additional liquidity due to the impact of the new wave of COVI D-19 infections 
which could be prolonged6/. It was expected that businesses would obtain financing 
mainly through commercial banks  to benefit from the new soft loan measures announced 
by the government and low interest rates . At the same time, financial in stitutions would 
remain cautious in extending credit throughout the first quarter of 2021, especially to new

likely be limited  as businesses shift to borrow from commercia l banks  due to the lower 
financing costs compared to bonds . This is because interest rates offered by commercial 
banks would likely remain low, while long -term Thai government bond yields could be driven 
higher by external factors and the high corporate cr edit spread for issuers with lower credit 
rating (BBB). Demand for household credit was expected to increase , especially for 
consumer loans and credit card loans to manage their liquidity during the new wave of 
COVID -19 infections . This increase in demand could also be attributed by the  enhancement 
and extension to the soft loan programs offered by specialized financial institutions .  
The baht against the U .S. dollar and the nominal effective exchange rate depreciated 
from the previous quarter due to the ap preciation of the U .S. dollar following the 
announcement of the large stimulus package in the U .S. which improved the outlook of 
the U.S. economy . 
In the first quarter of 2021, 
the baht against the U .S. dollar  
depreciated compared to the previous  
quarter  (Chart 2 .15). This was due 
to the appreciation of the U .S. dollar 
following the announcement of the 
large stimulus package in the U .S., 
which improved the outlook of the 
U.S. economy while also sparking 
market concerns regarding inflation 
expectations in the U .S. Nevertheless, 
the Federal Reserve  maintained that 
it would continue to pursue monetary 
easing and allow inflation to accelerate 
under the new monetary policy 
framework  which now targets the 
average inflation . Between March 1 – 23, 2021, the exchan ge rate averaged 30 .65 baht to 
the U .S. dollar, which was a 1 .9 percent depreciation from the December 2020 average . 
Between March 1 – 23, 2021,  
the Nominal Effective Exchange 
Rate (NEER ) averaged 122 .14, 
depreciating by 0 .8 percent from 
the December 2020 average as the 
baht depreciated in line with most 
trading partner currencies (Chart 
2.16). The preliminary Real Effective  
Exchange Rate (REER ) in February  
2021 depreciated by 0 .5 percent  
from the December 2020 average .

Monetary Policy Report  March 2021                                                                                                                 22 Financial system stability rema ined vulnerable to the slow economic recovery, especially 
from the financial positions of households and businesses . The debt serviceability of the 
private sector must therefore be closely monitored, especially once the various support 
measures gradually p hase out .  
Financial system stability was still vulnerable to the slow economic recovery . 
The stability of financial institutions remained robust, as reflected by high level of capital 
buffers and reserves held by commercial banks as well as ample liquidit y in the banking 
system . However, financial system stability was still fragile as financial positions and  debt 
serviceability of households and businesses remained weak . Key risks to financial stability 
that must be monitored are as follows . 
1. Fragile hou sehold balance sheets  were a key risk to financial system 
stability . Household debt to GDP rose from 86 .6 percent in the third quarter of 2020 to 89 .3 
percent in the fourth quarter of 2020 . This was mainly due to contractions in GDP growth 
given that growt h in household debt remained stable at 3 .9 percent . It was expected that the 
household debt -to-GDP ratio as of end -2021 would not be larger than the ratio seen at the 
end of 2020 given that the economy would likely recover at around the same pace as 
househ old debt .  
The debt serviceability of households must be closely monitored . While the 
share of stage -3 NPLs in consumer loans remained stable at 2 .8 percent at the end of 2020 
due to measures to assist retail borrowers and debt restructuring, Thailand ’s ec onomic 
recovery was still subject to large degrees of uncertainties . In this regard, households would 
still need to rely on continued support from government measures to  assist with their income 
recovery and debt serviceability . As such, the credit quality  of consumer loans needs to be 
monitored closely as after the phase -out of government measures .  
2. Financial positions of businesses continued to improve from the previous 
quarter, but vulnerabilities in some business sectors must be closely monitored, 
especially tourism -related businesses which have yet to recover from the first wave of 
COVID -19 infections whilst also being affected by the new wave . The resumption in 
economic activities after containment measures were relaxed combined with cost -reduction 
efforts on part of the businesses saw overall operating profit margin (OPM ) improved from 
the previous quarter . The overall interest coverage ratio (ICR) also improved from the 
previous quarter, especially among manufacturing and petroleum -related business es, partly 
due to exports growth driven by the global economic recovery . Nevertheless, the financial 
positions of SMEs and tourism -related services such as hotels, restaurant, and commerce 
were still fragile . While their OPM improved due to government meas ures to boost domestic 
demand, these businesses experienced losses and their debt serviceability deteriorated . In 
sum, the share of stage -3 NPLs of businesses overall remained stable at 3 .2 percent as of 
end-2020, while the share of stage -3 NPLs of SMEs we re still on the rise .  
In the period ahead, the new wave of COVID -19 would exacerbate the uneven 
recovery across sectors and therefore the financial positions and debt serviceability of 
businesses must be closely monitored, especially for SMEs and tourism -related services .   
Monetary Policy Report  March 2021                                                                                                                 23 3. The real estate market remained fragile given large housing inventories and 
the longer time -to-go in 2020, especially for low -rise properties and condominiums in 
the price range of 1 -2 million baht . Despite higher demand for low -rise properties since 
the COVID -19 pandemic and the 10 -percent contraction in number of new real estate 
projects in 2020, the inventory of low -rise properties in Bangkok and vicinities grew 8 .6 
percent and the overall time -to-go increased to 54 months  across al l price range . Meanwhile, 
inventory of condominiums in Bangkok and vicinities contracted by 3 .2 percent in 2020 on 
account of the 61 -percent contraction in the number of new real estate projects as well as 
price competition and sales promotion activities b y developers in order to sell off their 
inventories . Nevertheless, the time -to-go for condominiums in Bangkok and vicinities still 
increased to 30 months with condominiums in the 1 -2 million baht price range being most at 
risk due to a significant rise in inventory and time -to-go. 
Risks in the real estate market stemmed from weak demand and financial positions 
of property developers who could face liquidity shortage . However, the demand for housing 
gradually recovered in the fourth quarter of 2020 as refle cted by the 3 .1 percent growth in 
new mortgage loans and less stringent credit underwriting standards of commercial banks . 
Overall, the recovery and risks in the real estate market still required close monitoring going forward .

Thailand ’s economic growth was projected to slow down slightly due to the new wave of 
COVID -19 infections in the beginning of 2021 . Inflation was projected to rise in tandem  
with crude oil prices .  
The Committee projected that 
the Thai economy would grow 3 .0 
percent in 2021, which is lower than the 
3.2 percent growth projected in the 
previous  Monetary Policy Report . The 
downward revision to the growth forecast 
was attributable to the  new wave of 
COVID -19 in the beginning of the year 
which was more severe than previously 
assessed (Chart 2 .18), and lower foreign 
tourist figures from delays in Thailand ’s 
border re -opening and strict international 
travel restrictions especially those faced 
by Chinese tourists . However, the impact  
of the new w ave of infections on the Thai 
economy was not as severe as the first 
wave  thanks to less restrictive containment  
measures relative to last year, and the support from additional government measures to 
alleviate its impact (Box: Government measures in respon se to COVID -19). Additionally, 
Thailand ’s economic growth would benefit from the exports recovered in tandem with trading 
partner economies . Outturns of GDP in the fourth quarter of 2020 was also better than 
expected in many components . As such, the Thai e conomy was projected to slow down only 
slightly overall .  
The Thai economy was projected to grow 4 .7 percent in 2022 , slightly lower than 
in the previous Monetary Policy Report . This downward revision was on account of lower 
government expenditure under th e fiscal year 2022 annual budget and the reallocation of 
some spending under the Emergency Decree to transfer payments under to the remedy 
plan. Nevertheless, the anticipated rebound in foreign tourist figures once vaccination 
becomes more widespread in Th ailand and abroad would support the return of Thailand ’s 
GDP to pre -pandemic levels in the second half of 2022 .  
Additional assumptions underpinning the latest growth forecasts  are as follows . 
First, Thailand could relax the new containment measures and th e situation could return to 
normal within the first half of 2021 . Second, countries could achieve widespread vaccination 
around mid -2021 . This would allow Thailand to reduce the length of  mandatory quarantine 
upon arrival in Thailand — from 14 days to 10 d ays for those with “COVID -19 free certificate ” 
and to 7 days for those with vaccine certificate  — within the second quarter of 2021, and 
eventually remove the quarantine requirement altogether in the fourth quarter of 2021 . 
Commercial flights would also be  permitted to enter the country without requiring passengers 
to present vaccination certificate or COVID -19 test results within the second half of 2022 .

 Third, the government could effectively disburse budgeted expenditure under the Emergency 
Decree . 
Head line inflation was projected to rise to 1 .2 percent in 2021  on the back of 
higher crude oil prices . Headline inflation would temporarily spike in the second quarter of 
2021 due to the low -base effect as crude oil prices were low in the same period last yea r. 
Headline inflation was projected to be 1 .0 percent in 2022 . Overall, headline inflation 
would return to the target range around mid -2021 and would remain close to the lower 
bound of the target throughout the forecast period . 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Summary of key fo recast assumptions  
 Trading partner economies  were projected expand faster on account the large stimulus 
package in the U .S. as well as the clarity on stimulus measures in other countries such as 
the euro area, the UK, and Hong Kong. At the same time, the o utturns of economic 
indicators in the fourth quarter of 2021 contracted less than expected in many countries . 
In the near -term, trading partner economies would be somewhat affected by the new 
wave of COVID -19 infections . In the long -run, trading partner ec onomies would register 
robust growth through to 2022 .     
 The Federal Funds Rate  was expected to remain low for an extended period of time.  
The rate was projected to be maintained in the 0.00 -0.25 percent range throughout 2022 .   
 Regional currencies (excluding the Chinese yuan ) were projected to appreciate throughout  
the forecast horizon . This was based on the appreciation seen in the beginning of 2021 
due to better recovery prospects of Asian economies and improved investor confidence 
from the efficacy an d distribution of vaccines .   
 Dubai crude oil prices  was revised up throughout the forecast horizon due to the significantly  
lower supply of oil in the short run, especially from the U .S. producers where oil production  was 
affected by the winter storms. Me anwhile, the slowdown in investment by U .S. oil producers  
would hamper the production of shale oil . In the period ahead, crude oil prices would 
gradually pick up in line with demand and the global economic recovery .

  Farm income (excluding government suppo rt measures ) for 2021 was revised  up in 
accordance with the rise in prices of many agricultural products especially rubber, palm 
oil, and pork . Demand for rubber would increase from the production of rubber gloves and 
automobiles . Farm income growth would slow down in 2022 due to the high -base effect of 
agricultural prices in 2021 .  
 Public spending at current price  was revised down due to (1) lower expenditure under the 
fiscal year 2022 budget due to lower projected revenue collection from the economic 
slowdown; (2) some expenditures under the Emergency Decree being carried over as 
transfer payments under the remedy plan; and (3) the likelihood that the effectiveness of 
budget disbursement could be lower than expected . 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Merchandise exports was expected  to register to higher growth on the back of the economic 
recovery among trading partners .  
The value of Thai merchandise exports was projected to register higher growth in 
2021 and 2022 driven by higher export prices following the increase in crude oil pr ices, 
as well as higher export quantity in tandem with trading partners’ economic recovery . In 
particular, the large U .S. fiscal stimulus package would have positive effects on other trading 
partners  and spur  the recovery in global trade and investments . Meanwhile, the value of Thai 
gold exports would decline slightly due to the decline in gold prices . The Committee assessed 
that the value of Thai merchandise exports would grow by 10.0 percent in 2021 and 6 .3 
percent in 2022 .  
Exports of services would cont inue to contract and recover at a slow pace .  
The tourism sector was projected to grow at a slower pace than previously 
assessed  due to delays in the re -opening of Thailand ’s borders to foreign tourists as well as 
other negative factors such as the strict international travel restrictions in countries like 
China, delayed vaccination in some countries, and virus mutations  in many countries, which 
would dampen tourism sentiment and confidence in international travel . The Committee 
hence revised down the forei gn tourist figures to 3 .0 million in 2021 and 21 .5 million 
in 2022  (Chart 2 .19).

Current account surplus was projected to decline significantly in 2021 due to high 
import growth .  
The current account balance was projected to register a surplu s of 1 .2 billion 
U.S. dollars in 2021 , a large downward revision from the previous assessment . The decline 
was mainly due to low foreign tourist figures and higher import prices following the rise in 
crude oil prices . However, the decline in current accoun t surplus in 2021 would be partly 
attributed to temporary factors namely (1) the large net gold imports during periods of 
declining gold prices; (2) higher freight costs from the shortage of containers which would 
likely be resolved in 2022 . The current ac count balance would record a larger surplus of 
approximately 25 billion U .S. dollars in 2022 following the recovery in foreign tourist figures . 
Private consumption growth would be higher than expected in the near term, but recovery  
was not yet broad -base d.  
Private consumption growth in 2021 would be stronger than previously assessed  
as private consumption in the fourth quarter of 2020 turned out stronger -than-expected due 
to car purchases by high -income households during the end -of-year sales promotion 
campaigns and the rollout of government measures that helped support a swift recovery in 
economic activities after containment measures were relaxed . However, while economic 
activities and household income gradually recovered amidst the new wave of COVID -19 
infections in the beginning of the year, the economic recovery remained uneven across 
economic sectors . Labor income in export -related businesses continued to recover but that 
in tourism -related businesses was still affected by the low foreign tourist figur es. This was 
reflected in labor income indicators which showed that income in the service sector 
remained low . Additionally, the income of those in the low -income group was still declining . 
Against this backdrop, it was expected that private consumption gr owth would be 
modest  in the period ahead . Fragile household balance sheets due to elevated household 
debt along with weak labor market would be key  drags to the recovery of private consumption  
going forward .

Private investment  would improve in 2021  from investment in machinery and 
equipment driven by international trade and better -than-expected private consumption 
growth . Meanwhile, public -private partnership (PPP) investment pr ojects, particularly those 
in the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC), were progressing with greater clarity such as the 
Laem Chabang Port (Phase 3 ) project . This helped support the overall investment sentiment 
in Thailand despite delays in some PPP projects s uch as the Orange Line MRT .  
Headline inflation would be slightly higher due to rising crude oil prices and was expected  to 
return to the lower bound of the target range around mid -2021 .  
The rise in headline inflation projection for this year would be pr imarily driven 
by supply -side factors,  namely the increase in Dubai crude oil prices to an average of 60 
U.S. dollars per barrel . Nevertheless, higher input costs from oil would have limited pass -
through to prices in other categories as the government ’s me asures to reduce electricity bills 
would help offset the higher energy costs, while subdued demand in the current economic 
environment would prevent businesses from raising prices . Headline inflation was expected 
to decline temporarily in the first quarter  of 2021 because of government measures to reduce 
electricity and water bills before spiking temporarily in the second quarter of 2021 due to the 
low-base effect as Dubai crude oil prices were low at about 30 U .S. dollars per barrel in the 
same period last  year. Against this backdrop, the Committee kept core inflation projections  
unchanged at 0 .3 percent in 2021 and 0 .4 percent in 2022 and revised the headline 
inflation projections to 1 .2 percent in 2021 and 1 .0 percent in 2022 . The Committee 
assessed that headline inflation would return to the target range around mid -2021 and would 
remain close to the lower bound of the target throughout the forecast period .

Monetary Policy Report  March 2021                                                                                                                 29 Thailand ’s economic outlook was still subject to uncertainties and downside . The recover y 
ahead would be largely dependent on the gradual re -opening of Thailand ’s border to 
foreign tourists .  
The Committee assessed that Thailand ’s economic outlook was still subject to 
uncertainties and downside risks as reflected by the  wide fan chart  skewin g to the 
downside (Chart 2 .20). The level of uncertainty has somewhat receded recently given that 
the new wave of COVID -19 infections appeared to be manageable, and the efficacy of 
COVID -19 vaccines was in line with expectations . Nevertheless, Thailand ’s economic 
growth could still underperform the baseline projection  due to the following factors . 
First, the re -opening of Thailand ’s borders to foreign tourists could be delayed further due to 
limitations in the COVID -19 vaccination such as the sufficiency of  vaccine supply, concerns 
about the efficacy and side effects of vaccines, and the emergence of new COVID -19 strains  
(Box: The recovery in foreign tourist arrivals – a key risk to Thailand ’s economic recovery ). 
Second, fiscal stimulus could be lower than e xpected if there are delays in the approval of 
projects under the Emergency Decree which would remain in effect until the third quarter of 
2022 . Third, balance sheets of businesses could deteriorate further, possibly triggering 
permanent business closure a nd lay -offs. This could result in scarring effects that would 
hinder the recovery of businesses and labor  even after the pandemic subsided . Fourth, the 
default rate of business and household sectors could surge once credit relief measures are 
phased out . 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Upside risks that could see Thailand ’s economic growth outperforming the 
baseline projection  are as follows . First, herd immunity through vaccination might be 
achieved earlier than previously expected, thus bringing an earlier resolution to the COVI D-
19 outbreak abroad and allowing Thailand to re -open its borders to foreign tourists sooner . 
Second, the government might deploy additional stimulus measures to support domestic 
consumption and investment, while financial and credit relief measures implem ented might 
be more effective than expected . Third, domestic demand growth might be stronger than 
expected as public investment in infrastructure projects and PPP projects could attract 
higher private investment . Fourth, multinational corporations could sh ift their orders and 
production base to Thailand more than expected .

 The recovery in foreign tourist arrivals – 
 a key risk to Thailand ’s economic recovery  
Thailand ’s economic recovery in the period ahead remained highly uncertain 
and would depend largely on the r ecovery in foreign tourist arrivals . This is because 
income from spending by foreign tourists accounts for 11 percent of GDP and tourism -related  
businesses accounts for 20 percent of total employment in Thailand .  
If the COVID -19 pandemic is prolonged furt her by additional wave of infections 
and virus mutations, the recovery in foreign tourist arrivals  might be slower than expected . 
The Committee assessed 3 recovery scenarios for the Thai economy  based around the 
efficacy of COVID -19 vaccines and the durati on of achieving a widespread coverage of COVID -19 
vaccination, both of which would determine the pace of Thailand ’s border re -opening, tourism 
sentiment, and overall economic activities . Foreign tourist figures in 2021 is expected to could 
be between 0 .1 million to 3 million, which would result in GDP growth ranging from -1.7 to 3 .0 
percent (Chart 1 ). The details of each scenario are as follows .

Source : forecast by Bank of Thailand  
 
 1. In the baseline,  foreign tourist figures in 2021 would be 3 .0 million and GDP 
would grow 3 .0 percent . In this scenario, a coverage of vaccination in both Thailand and 
abroad is effective and well -underway in 2021 .The government can r elax quarantine  
requirements for foreign tourists arriving in Thailand starting from the second quarter and 
provide exemptions for those that have been vaccinated and possess certificates showing 
that they are COVID -19 free starting from the fourth quarter . For 2022, it is expected that the 
proportion of people who have been vaccinated in both Thailand and abroad would be high 
enough to reopen to foreign visitors without requiring vaccine certificates or negative COVID -19 
test results within the second half  of the year . Foreign tourist figures in 2022  are expected to 
be 21 .5 million and GDP would grow 4 .7 percent .  
  2. In the worse case , foreign tourist figures would not recover through to end -2021 
and GDP would continue to contract from 2020 . The assumptio ns for this scenario are as 
follows . First, there is a third wave of COVID -19 infections in Thailand in the latter half of 
2021 while vaccine procurement and distribution are also delayed . As such, the conditions -
free re -opening of Thailand ’s borders is pu shed back even further . Second, international 
travel restrictions and domestic travel promotion campaigns in China could impact the 
recovery in the number of Chinese tourists who have been the main source of income for 
Thailand ’s tourism industry . Third, v irus mutations in many countries hinder the effectiveness 
of vaccine and thus affecting demand for tourism . In this scenario, foreign tourist figures  
Monetary Policy Report  March 2021                                                                                                                 33  
would be 0 .1 million in 2021 and 10 million in 2022 and the Thai economy would 
contract by 0 .5 percent in  2021 before resuming positive growth of 3 .5 percent in 2022 .   
 3 . In the worst case , foreign tourist figures would recover significantly slower than 
the baseline scenario . This is under the assumption that the mutation of the virus becomes 
more severe ac ross countries, rendering vaccines ineffective in reducing hospitalization 
rates and deaths . New vaccines are developed and starts being distributed in early -2023 . 
The re -opening of Thailand ’s border to foreign tourists would be pushed back to the latter 
half of 2023 . Delays in vaccine development would also impact Thailand ’s economic growth 
through exports given that trading partners ’ growth would slow down  from strict containment 
measures and affect the supply chain . In this scenario, foreign tourist figu res would be 
0.1 million for both 2021 and 2022, and the Thai economy would contract 1 .7 percent in 
2021 and 0 .3 percent in 2022 . It is important to note that the Bank of Thailand ’s assessment 
of the worst case scenario was intended to evaluate the crisis situation and potential impact 
on financial system stability, as well as to prepare contingency measures as needed . 
 The situation remains highly uncertain and there are many factors that would 
affect the recovery in tourism . The Committee would closely mo nitor the recovery in 
foreign tourist figures given its significant implications for Thailand ’s economic 
recovery going forward  (Chart 2 ) .  In particular, the Committee will monitor vaccination 
progress in Thailand and abroad, the virus mutation of COVID -19 and the efficacy of 
vaccines, infection rates in Thailand and abroad, and progress in re -opening Thailand ’s 
borders to foreign tourists to re -evaluate the different recovery scenarios periodically .

The MPC ma intained the policy rate at 0 .50 percent and assessed that the continued low 
policy rate would help support economic recovery, which was still subject to uncertainties  and 
risks. Therefore, the limited policy space should be preserved for the appropriate a nd 
most effective timing . 
At the meetings on February 3 and March 24, 2021, the Committee voted 
unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 0 .50 percent . The Committee assessed that 
the Thai economy continued to expand despite the impact of the new wave of COVID -19 
infections. However, the impact of the new wave was less severe compared to the first 
outbreak due to less strict containment measures which amounted to a relatively smaller 
economic impact. In addition, the timely implementation of fiscal stimulu s measures and 
export recovery in line with trading partner economies ’ growth helped the economy to 
expand . Nevertheless, the Thai economy would grow at a slower pace in both 2020 and 
2021 compared to the projections from December 2020 . This is due to the impact of the new 
wave of COVID -19 infections, the lower foreign tourist figures given the gradual pace of 
border re -openings, virus mutations in many countries, and the reduction in the fiscal year 
2022 budget from lower projected revenue collection . More over, the economic recovery 
remains highly uncertain and uneven across economic sectors . The financial  system 
remained sound, but vulnerabilities increased in the business and household sectors . This is 
especially true for  SMEs and low -income households th at have yet to recover from the 
impact of the first wave of COVID -19 infections and were further affected by the new wave of 
infections, which resulted in declining labor income and increasing numbers of unemployed and 
underemployed workers . Headline infla tion would return to the target range around mid -2021 
and remain close to the lower bound of the target range throughout the forecast period . 
Medium -term inflation expectations remained well anchored within the target range . The 
Committee therefore assesse d that the Thai economy still needed support from the continued  
low policy rate given that the recovery remained subject to high certainties and risks, and 
thus the limited policy space should be preserved for the appropriate and most effective timing . 
In determining the appropriate course of monetary policy, details on the key assessment  
are as follow.  
The continuity of government measures and policy coordination among government agencies  
would be critical in supporting economic recovery going forward .  
Thailand ’s economic outlook  remained  subject to high degree of uncertainties . 
There is still the possibility that the COVID -19 pandemic could be prolonged and 
complicated by  the virus mutations , which could hinder the efficacy of vaccines and 
impact the econ omic recovery especially for the tourism sector . There is also the risk that 
disbursement of expenditure under the new relief plan of the Emergency Decree could be 
lower than expected . Furthermore, Thailand ’s economic recovery would also take a long 
time t o gain strong footing and remains uneven across business sectors . The Committee 
viewed that the continuity of government measures and policy coordination among 
government agencies would be critical to the economic recovery going forward .  
So far, recent fi scal measures that were swiftly implemented in response to the new wave of  
Monetary Policy Report  March 2021                                                                                                                 35 COVID -19 infections played vital roles in supporting the economy . Looking ahead,  the 
government should prepare a policy package of financial and fiscal measures that would 
ensure co ntinuity of policy support and addresses the relevant risks in each period . The 
government should also devise additional measures for the worst -case scenarios as needed 
to mitigate the adverse economic impacts and prevent scarring effects . It is also impor tant 
that additional fiscal measures being deployed to ensure the sufficiency and the continuity of 
fiscal impulse during the recovery would not contribute significant risks to medium -term fiscal 
sustainability (Box: Preparing for risks to Thailand ’s econo mic outlook ). 
The economic recovery has become more uneven across economic sectors and thus it 
would be necessary to provide timely, well -targeted assistance through the new financial 
rehabilitation measures to assist businesses affected by the pandemic an d credit relief 
measures for retail borrowers . 
The new wave of COVID -19 infections exacerbated the fragile balance sheets of 
businesses and households and the uneven economic recovery across sectors, especially  
SMEs, tourism -related services, and low -incom e households . For businesses, this new 
wave of COVID -19 infections would result in lower income and a more fragile balance sheet 
position, especially SMEs and service businesses which have yet to recover from the first 
wave of infections . Default risks and  credit risks of businesses could increase to a point 
where it could affect access to credit even if there is ample liquidity in the financial system .  
The Committee saw the need to expedite well -targeted financial assistance and 
credit relief through the implementation of the new financial rehabilitation measures 
to restore businesses affected by the COVID -19 pandemic, proposed by the Bank of 
Thailand, the Ministry of Finance, and other related parties7/. These measures would 
ensure that the large amount o f liquidity in the financial system is  channeled to the target 
group in a more effective, flexible, and inclusive manner to meet the varying needs of each 
business sectors and support the economic recovery in the period ahead . These measures 
will provide c redit relief for viable businesses that were severely affected by the pandemic 
and would take a long time to recovery, through the new soft loan facility and the asset 
warehousing program (Box: Financial rehabilitation measures to support and restore viabl e 
businesses ). 
Low-income households have yet to recover from the previous wave of COVID -19 
infections and were further affected by the new wave of infections, resulting in further 
declines in household income . The numbers of unemployed and underemployed w orkers 
are on the rise, especially those who are freelance workers, daily hires outside the agricultural  
sector, and hotel workers . The Committee was concerned that the labor market remained  
fragile, and that household debt remained elevated and might furt her deteriorate in 
credit quality . Thus, the Committee saw the need to closely monitor labor market 
developments and household credit quality, while also expediting measures to assist 
retail borrowers  through the Debt Clinic, the debt restructuring program s, the improved 
calculations of default interest rate, and debt mediation .

household as well as to strengthen their financial positions while financial conditions 
are still accommo dative . Doing so would support the economic recovery and prepare the 
economy for the uncertainties ahead .  
Long -term Thai government bond yields increased in tandem with U .S. treasury yields 
over the recent period, although this had limited impact on domes tic financial conditions . 
Meanwhile, the baht depreciated in line with other currencies in the region . 
Long -term Thai government bond yields increased in tandem with U.S. Treasury yields 
over the recent period . Nevertheless, this had limited impact on dome stic financial conditions 
and financing costs of the private sector and households, given that most still obtain financing 
primarily from banks . Financial markets were also able to adjust accordingly through market 
mechanisms and function as normal . Meanwh ile, the baht depreciated against the U .S. dollar, 
in line with other regional currencies . Despite the pressure on the baht having abated due to 
the significant reduction in Thailand ’s current account surplus in 2021, the Committee would 
closely monitor de velopments in the FX market and capital flows as well as their implications 
on the economic recovery going forward . The Committee also considers the need to deploy 
additional measures as deemed appropriate to ensure that the exchange rate does not 
impede e conomic recovery . The Committee will continue to expedite the new FX ecosystem in 
Thailand, which would directly address the structural challenges in Thailand ’s foreign exchange  
market and facilitate more balanced capital flows . 
Economic structural reform policies  would foster a sustainable economic recovery and 
uplift long -term growth potential .  
The Committee assessed that Thailand ’s growth potential has been declining 
after each subsequent crisis . The COVID -19 pandemic would impact long -term growth 
pote ntial (Chart 3 .1) and exacerbate  structural challenges of the Thai economy  – aging 
population, income inequality, and excess capacity . Thus, the public sector must push forth 
structural reform policies that are relevant to the post -COVID world. This includ e labor 
upskilling and reskilling, mitigating excess capacity for many businesses waiting to be 
revitalized or transitioned into new business models through asset warehousing, and 
developing fundamental infrastructure to support the digital economy . These efforts will help 
foster a sustainable economic recovery and uplift long -term growth potential .

restore the economy and finance key infrastructure projects . The approval and 
disbursement of remaining expenditure under the relief plan of the Emergency Decree 
should be expedited to ensure continuity of fiscal impulse and help uplift growth potential . The 
government should also implement revenue and expenditure reforms in order to enhance the 
effectiveness of fiscal policies as well as promote long -term fiscal sustainability . 
The Committee continued to put emphasis on supporting economic recovery, and stand 
ready to use additional appropriate monetary policy tools if necessary.  
Unde r the monetary policy framework with objectives of maintaining price stability , 
supporting sustainable and full -potential economic growth, and preserving financial 
stability, the Committee continued to place great emphasis on supporting the economi c 
recove ry. To formulate the appropriate course of policy action going forward, the Committee 
will monitor the adequacy of government measures, fragility in the labor market, balance 
sheets of businesses and households, and the various risks namely the COVID -19 ou tbreak 
in Thailand and abroad as well as the progress in re -opening borders to foreign tourists . The 
Committee would stand ready to use additional appropriate monetary policy tools if necessary.

Preparing for risks to Thailand ’s econom ic outlook   
In the period ahead, the Thai economy would gain tailwind from additional 
fiscal and financial measures but also faces headwinds from the outbreak of COVID -19 
in Thailand and abroad . A key emerging risk is the more virulent virus mutations, 
which could hinder the efficacy of the vaccines and impact the economic recovery, especially 
in the tourism sector . The uncertainties posed by those risks warranted close monitoring by 
the government . The continuity of government measures and policy coordinat ion among 
government agencies would be critical to the economic recovery . Fiscal policy, in 
particular , will play important roles in shoring up growth . In addition, the government 
should also devise additional measures for the worst -case scenario if the si tuation 
takes an unexpected turn .    
Chart 1 The Thai economy gained additional tailwind from fiscal and financial measures but remained 
subject to risks stemming from the mutations of COVID -19.  
Note : Change from the December 2020 Monetary Policy Report  in green . 
  H1 - 2021  H2 - 2021  2022  
Tailwinds  - Additional measures under 
the Emergency Decree  
(“We win” financial aid, 
“Section 33 We Love Each 
Other” financial aid,  
“Tour Tiew Thai” subsidy ) 
- The new soft loan facility 
and the asset warehousing 
progra m 
- Relaxation of containment 
measures  
-  Trading partners ’ economic 
recovery  -  Widespread vaccination 
abroad and in Thailand  
-  Foreign tourists are able to 
travel to Thailand without 
being subject to quarantine 
requirements, but 
vaccination and COVID -19 
test certificates are 
required .   - Thailand and other 
countries achieve herd 
immunity from sufficient 
vaccination . 
- Re-opening for commercial 
flights into Thailand and 
foreign tourists are able to 
enter the country without 
the need to present 
vaccinatio n and COVID -19 
test certificates .  
-  Good progress in infrastructure investment and public -
private partnership (PPP) projects, especially in the EEC, 
improves the investment climate in Thailand . 
Headwinds  - New wave of COVID -19 
infections in Thailand impact 
the economic recovery  
- Containment measures 
abroad are prolonged  - Credit relief and other 
financial measures 
expires at the end of 
2021 . The government 
will re -assess the 
situation thoroughly .   - Stimulus support from 
measures under the 
Emergency  Decree phases out  
 
Risks  - Financial institutions remain 
cautious in extending credit, 
resulting in less liquidity 
being channeled to 
businesses than previously 
expected .  
- The re -opening of Thailand ’s 
borders is delayed due to 
concerns over the mutatio ns 
of COVID -19 and 
vaccination delays in both 
Thailand and abroad .  - The efficacy and 
coverage of COVID -19 
vaccines remain 
uncertain  
- The more virulent virus 
mutation s - Tourism could change in the 
post-COVID world, resulting in 
lower -than-expected forei gn 
tourist figures .   
Monetary Policy Report  March 2021                                                                                                                 39  
The important tailwinds are the additional fiscal measures rolled out after the new wave of 
COVID -19 and the return of foreign tourist arrival towards end -2021 .  
 In the first half of 2021, the important tailwinds are the additional  fiscal measures  
rolled out after the new wave of COVID -19 (i.e. “We win” financial aid, “Section 33 We Love  
Each Other” financial aid , “Tour Tiew Thai” subsidy ) and the new financial rehabilitation 
measures . The new financial rehabilitation measures inclu de the new soft loan facility 
targeted at supporting high -potential SMEs that were adversely affected by the pandemic 
and would take time to recover, and the asset warehousing program  aimed to reduce the 
debt burden and provide another opportunity to conti nue business operations . Towards the 
end of 2021, the gradual re -opening of Thailand ’s borders to foreign tourists without 
quarantine requirements would lead to an increase in foreign tourist figures and help 
tourism -related services recove r. However, vacc ination and infection test certificates are still 
required.  
Key risks to the growth outlook are the delays in the re -opening of Thailand ’s borders due to 
concerns over the mutations of COVID -19 and delayed vaccination in both Thailand and 
abroad . 
The growt h outlook is subject to additional risks from potential delays in the 
re-opening of Thailand ’s borders  due to concerns over the mutations of COVID -19 and 
delayed vaccination in both Thailand and abroad . Furthermore, should the virulent 
mutations of COVID -19 could lead to vaccine inefficacy that requires new vaccines to 
be developed, the gradual re -opening of Thailand ’s borders to foreign tourists might 
be delayed further  (Box: The recovery in foreign tourist arrivals – a key risk to Thailand ’s 
economic reco very)    
Government measures will be critical to supporting Thailand ’s economic recovery, which 
remained highly uncertain and requires sufficient and continued support from fiscal and 
financial measures .  
Thailand ’s growth outlook remained highly uncertain . The economic recovery 
ahead would require sufficient and continued support from fiscal and financial 
measures in order to provide relief measures and support economic recovery . 
Additional fiscal measures did not pose significant risks to medium -term fisc al 
sustainability  due to several factors . First, it is possible the public debt to GDP ratio 
could decline if GDP outgrows public debt . This was reflected by the experience during 
the 1997 crisis whereby public debt to GDP increased to 57 .8 percent in 2000  before 
declining to 47 .5 percent over the next 3 years as the economy rebounded strongly . 
Continuous, well -targeted, and effective fiscal measures will help alleviate the short -run 
growth impact and bring the economy back on a strong footing . Second, risk s related to 
the composition of public debt remained low . Thailand ’s public debt consisted mostly of 
long-term debt with an average time -to-maturity of about 10 years and was mostly 
denominated in baht  (Chart 2 ). Third, borrowing costs for the government r emained low  
in line with the trajectory of the policy rate and were lower than the projected GDP growth . 
Yields on the 10 -year Thai government bonds were also lower than those of other emerging 
markets in the region8/.   
                                                             
8/ As of March 23, 2021, the 10 -year government bond yields for Thailand, Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia 
were 1 .9 percent, 2 .8 percent, 3 .4 percent, and 6 .7 percent, respectively . (Sour ce: Thai Bond Market  
Association, Bloomberg )

 Additional financial measures bei ng rolled out to mitigate risks should ensure 
that the assistance provided to those affected are more inclusive and should be 
flexible enough that the conditions could adapt to the prevailing situation at the time 
and accommodate the worst -case scenarios . To that end, the Bank of Thailand and the 
Ministry of Finance announced new financial measures9/ in response to the new wave of 
COVID -19 infections . The legal text of these measures only includes broad principles so as 
to leave enough flexibility to make f urther adjustments in the future . The Bank of Thailand 
and the Ministry of Finance will continue to monitor and periodically assess the 
effectiveness of the various measures to make refinements as needed to suit the 
evolving situation . The Committee has al so preserved the limited policy space in order to 
act at the appropriate and most effective timing .

The continuity of government measures and policy coordination among government  
agencies will be critical to Thailand ’s economic recovery . While monetary  policy  
remained accommodative, financial measures and credit relief measures  should channel 
liquidity to those affected in a targeted and timely manner in order to facilitate economic 
recovery going forward . Fiscal measures should continue to support the economy by 
maintaining the fiscal impulse and devising additional measures for the worst -case scenario . 
Supply -side policies  to support new business models and uplift labor skills would also 
foster a stronger and more sustainable economic recovery . 
 
   
 
 
 
                                                             
9/ Joint press release “Financial Rehabilitation measures to support business recovery post -COVID -19”  
(March 23, 2021 )  
Monetary Policy Report  March 2021                                                                                                                 41  
The new financial rehabilitation measures  
to support business recovery post -COVID -19 
Existing measures to alleviate short -term impacts of the pandemic might not be suitable nor 
sufficient to support Thailand ’s economic recovery in the period ahead, given  that the outbreak 
could be prolonged and is highly uncertain .  
The first wave of COVID -19 in 2019 resulted in sharp growth contractions due to the 
strict containment measures and businesses, especially SMEs, faced liquidity problems . At 
the time, the gove rnment viewed that the impact would be severe but short -lived. As such, 
the government announced  the soft loan10/ program to provide liquidity assistance to 
affected SMEs and offered a blanket  6-month debt moratorium for SMEs with a credit 
line not exceedin g 100 million baht .  
The timely implementation of financial measures would help alleviate the impact of the new 
wave of infections on Thailand ’s economic recovery and preserve Thailand ’s longer -term 
growth potential .  
  The new wave of COVID -19 exacerbated  fragility in balance sheet positions of 
high -potential businesses,  especially those that have yet to recover from the first wave . If 
the government does not provide timely financial assistance to these businesses, the 
economic recovery process could be dr awn out and become more uneven across economic 
sectors (K-shaped recovery ), affecting Thailand ’s growth potential over the long -term. 
Looking ahead, financial institutions would likely assess higher credit risks given that 
the outbreak could be prolonged a nd remain highly uncertain . This could affect 
access to credit, especially for SMEs, even though there is ample liquidity in the 
financial system . Without assistance from the government, businesses might face 
temporary liquidity shortages that could affect  their balance sheets to the extent that could 
lead to closure or employee lay -offs. This in turn would impact labor income and exacerbate 
the fragility of household balance sheets . In addition, this could further lead to widespread 
defaults, impacting the  balance sheet positions and credit intermediation functions of 
financial institutions and overall financial stability .   
The new financial rehabilitation measures were announced to channel liquidity to target groups 
in a more effective, flexible, and incl usive manner depending on the needs of each business sector .  
 After consultation with all stakeholders, both financial institutions and the 
private sector, the Bank of Thailand and the Ministry of Finance jointly announced 
new financial rehabilitation mea sures11/ to help Thai businesses sustain their operations 
and hiring as well as restore and adjust their business models to the post -COVID  
environment.  The measures focused on (1) achieving more effective channeling of liquidity  
to the target groups amidst heightened credit risks ; (2) having greater flexibility  by 
including only the broader principles within the legal text so as to give room for the measures 
to be adjusted to better serve the circumstances in the future; and (3) being more inclusive  
so as to  meet the varying needs of different business sectors, especially those that were 
heavily impacted by the pandemic and would take long to recover . The new financial

Chart 1 The public sector expedited the soft loans and asset warehousing measures to make the 
financial measures more comprehensive
 
 
 Details of the financial rehabilitation measures are as follows12/: 
1. Soft loan facility for businesses (totaling 250 billion baht ) to support high -potential  
SMEs affected by the pandemic . This measure addresses the limitations of the previous soft 
loan measure by expanding the pool of eligible borrowers to include new borrowers, expanding 
the loan tenor, expanding the credit limit, amending the interest rates  to facilitate lending, and 
expanding the pool of eligible collateral assets to include higher -risk assets . In addition, the 
government will waive or reduce related taxes and fees, while the Bank of Thailand will offer  
low-cost funding to financial instit utions to channel credit to businesses in need . These efforts 
will help prevent scarring effects and foster a swifter economic recovery going forward .  
2. The Asset Warehousing program (totaling 100 billion baht ) provides a standardized  
debt restructuring program with buy -back options for high -potential businesses that were 
adversely affected by the pandemic and would take time to recover . These businesses must 
also possess high high -potential business models and collaterals that could be transferred in 
order to be eligible for temporary debt relief . The program aims to temporarily reduce the 
principal payment and interest burden for businesses that would take time to recover, especially 
those in tourism -related services . Businesses whose assets have been tr ansferred as collateral 
may lease their assets from financial institutions to continue business operations which would 
help sustain hirin g in the short -term. Some businesses may opt to temporarily close  their 
business operations, which would reduce excess capacity and reduce the risk of asset fire sales . 
Businesses also have the rights to repurchase their collaterals from the financial institutions in 
order to resume business operations once the pandemic subsides . In support of the program, 
the government c an waive or reduce taxes and related fees, while the Bank of Thailand will offer 
low-cost funding to support the transfer of assets  by financial institutions .

The new financial rehabilitation measures were part of the comprehensive package of financial 
and fiscal measures to assist all borrowers affected by the COVID -19 pandemic .  
 Prior to March 23, 2021, when the financial rehabilitation measures aimed at SMEs 
borrowers were announced, the Bank of Thailand and the Ministry of Finance have 
implemented var ious measures to assist all borrowers . Previous measures aimed at 
assisting retail and business borrowers are as follows . 
 1. Measures to assist retail borrowers : The government provided income assistance  
to retail borrowers that faced temporary liquidity problems through programs such as “We Win”  
financial aid, “Section 33 We Love Each Other” financial aid, and the Half -Half Co -Payment 
scheme as well as soft loans from specialized financial institutions for working capital and 
liquidity purposes . The Bank of Thailand also implemented measures to assist existing 
borrowers such as the Debt Clinic, Debt Exit Fast Lane, Debt Restructuring Programs and 
Debt Mediation .   
 2. Measures to assist business borrowers : The government continued to implement 
measures to support financial institutions in providing relief to business borrowers, both SMEs 
and large corporates, especially through expediting the debt restructuring process . In addition, 
the government has set up the Corporate Bond Stabilization Fund (BSF) to pr ovide liquidity 
backstop to support financing activities in the bond market . So far, businesses have yet to apply

views from a wide range of perspectives . In the present arrangement, the MPC comprise 
7 members – 3 ex-officio members from the Bank of Thailand and 4 external members who

monetary policy act ions. The schedule of the MPC meetings  for the year is announced 
ahead of time . The MPC may hold a special meeting outside the regular schedule  to 
formulate a policy decision if needed . The MPC publishes their economic and inflation 
forecasts on a quarterly basis .

and information from discussions with related government agencies, all of which contributes to a 
comprehensive, thorough, and timely analysis in support of the decision -making process .  
(2) Pre-MPC meeting : The MPC members discuss the  latest developments, 
outlook,  and risks pertaining to economic growth, inflation, financial markets, and 
financial stability . The pre -MPC meeting serves as an input for the MPC meeting where the 
policy decisions are made . During periods where the situation i s highly uncertain, the MPC 
will also conduct different scenario analysis for the Thai economy,  taking into consideration 
the key risks to the outlook, and conduct stress tests to prepare for the worst -case scenario .  
(3) The MPC Meeting : The MPC members f urther discuss the key economic and 
financial issues as well as the different policy options in order to ascertain the most 
appropriate course of policy action . The MPC considers the mix of policy tools that would be 
used in an integrated manner, which inc ludes exchange rate policies and other measures under 
the managed -float exchange rate regime . In deciding the policy rate to signal the monetary 
policy direction, each MPC member will cast their vote and deliberate the rationale behind their 
decision . The MPC communicates its policy decision and the rationale in the MPC press release 
and edited minutes of the meeting . 
 (4) Communication to the public : The MPC secretariat will announce the outcome 
of the MPC meeting  at 2 p.m. on the day of the  MPC meeting . The announcement includes 
the policy decision and rationale, the key issues that were discussed, and a Q&A session with

Meeting is held on a quarterly basis . The Analyst Meeting provides an opportunity to have 
two-way communication where analysts can pose questions a bout the policy decisions and the 
views on the outlook directly to the MPC member13/. In the event that inflation movement 
deviates from the target range, the MPC will issue an open letter  to the Finance Minister to 
explain the underlying reasons of inflation movements and the monetary policy actions taken to 
guide inflation back to the target within an appropriate time horizon . The open letter is also 
published on the Bank of  Thailand website for public viewing .  
In addition to the main channels of communications above, the Bank of Thailand 
also communicates with the public regarding monetary policy and other measures 
through other channels  such as press interviews with the Go vernor and senior executives, 
press conference on monthly economic and monetary conditions, disseminating key information 
through short video clips and infographics on social media platforms . These additional channels 
of communication help keep the public informed of the latest economic developments, as well as 
the policy direction and rationales underpinning actions taken by the MPC and the Bank of Thailand .  
Asides from the 8 MPC Meetings held within the year, the MPC has a joint meeting 
with the Financia l Institution Policy Committee (FIPC ) at least twice a year to monitor and 
assess Thailand’s financial system stability as well as to share information between the 
two committees . The joint meeting enables the MPC to have a more complete and 
comprehensive set of information to formulate the appropriate monetary policy decision . It is also 
an opportunity to communicate financial stability issues to the public through the  press release 
on the outcome of the joint meeting between the MPC and FIPC .
