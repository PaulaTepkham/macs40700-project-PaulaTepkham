Monetary Policy in Thailand  
Monetary Policy Committee  
Under the Bank of Thailand Act, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) comprise s the 
governor and two deputy governors, as well as four distinguished external members  
representing various sectors of the economy , with the aim of ensuring  that monetary policy 
decisions are effective and transparent.  
Monetary Policy Objective  
The MPC sets monetary policy to promote  the objective of supporting sustainable a nd full 
potential economic growth, without causing inflationary problems or economic and financial 
imbalances or bubbles.  
Monetary Policy Target  
The Cabinet  approved the annual average headline inflation target of 2.5 + 1.5 percent as the 
target  for the medium  term and for 201 9. The inflation target  is to assure the general public 
that the MPC will take  necessary policy actions to return headline inflation to the target within 
an appropriate time horizon without jeopardizing growth and macro -financial stability.  In the 
event that headline inflation deviates from the target, the MPC shall explain the reas ons 
behind the target breach to the  Minister  of Finance and the  public, together with measures 
taken and estimated time to bring inflation back to the target.  
Monetary Policy Instrument  
The MPC utilizes the 1 -day bilateral repurchase transaction rate as the policy interest rate to 
signal the monetary policy stance.  
Evaluati on of Economic Conditions and Forecasts  
The Bank of Thailand takes into account  information from all sources, the macroeconomic 
model, data from each economic sector, as well as surveys  of large enterprises , together with  
small and medium -sized  enterprises from all over the country,  and various financial institutions  
to ensure that economic evaluations and forecasts are accurate and cover all aspects, both at 
the macro and micro levels.   
Monetary Policy Communication  
Recognizing the importance of monetary policy communication to the public, the MPC 
employs  various  channel s of communication, both in Thai and English, such as (1) organizing 
a press statement at 14 :00 on the day of the Committee meeting, (2) publishing edited 
minutes of the MPC meeting two weeks after the meeting, and (3) publishing the Monetary 
Policy Report  every quarter.  Monetary Policy Report March  2019  Content

Monetary Policy Report March  2019  1 Executive Summary  
Monetary Policy Conduct  in the First Quarter of 2019  
In the Committee’s view, the Thai economy was expected to expand around its potential, on the back of 
domestic demand, despite at a slower pace than previously assessed due to a slowdow n in external 
demand. Headline inflation was projected to be in line with the previous forecast. Core inflation would be 
slightly lower than previously assessed while still gradually trending up. However, there were pockets of risks 
in the financial system  that might pose vulnerabilities to financial stability in the future. The Committee 
weighed various factors in determining the most appropriate course of monetary policy and voted 
4 to 2 at the meeting on February 6, 2019 to maintain the policy rate at 1. 75 percent with one 
committee member absent. At the meeting on March 20, 2019, the Committee unanimously voted to 
maintain the policy rate at 1.75 percent.  The Committee viewed that the current accommodative monetary 
policy stance contributed to the contin uation of economic growth and was appropriate given the inflation 
target. In addition, given heightened global and domestic uncertainties in the current period, the Committee 
thus voted to keep the policy rate unchanged to assess the clarity of impacts fro m such uncertainties. 
Furthermore, there remained a need to address risks to financial stability through a combination of tools, 
including an appropriate policy rate as well as microprudential and macroprudential measures.  
Looking ahead, the policy rate i ncrease would be gradual and follow a data -dependent approach. The 
Committee would closely monitor developments of economic growth, inflation, and financial stability, 
together with associated risks, in deliberating appropriate monetary policy in the perio d ahead.  
Assessment of the Economic and Financial Outlook as the Basis for Policy Formulation  
1. Global Economy  
The global economy was expected to expand at a slower rate, but still close to its potential.  Private 
consumption of most trading partner econo mies continued to expand, consistent with strong labor market 
conditions and government support in some countries. Nonetheless, economic outturns in the fourth quarter 
of 2018 and developments in the first quarter of 2019 reflected that economic growth was  below expectations 
in many economies. This was due to the impact from global trade slowdown as well as country -specific 
factors. Such factors included a temporary impact from the U.S. government shutdown, hampered 
confidence in Europe following prolonged political issues, and uncertainties surrounding trade protectionist 
measures between the U.S. and China. The Committee thus revised down the growth projection of 
Thailand’s trading partner economies to be 3.2 percent for both 2019 and 2020. However, there 
remained possibilities that growth in the trading partner economies would underperform the 
baseline projection  due to uncertainties pertaining to trade negotiations between the U.S. and China as 
well as Brexit negotiations. Other risks that still warranted  monitoring included uncertainties regarding the 
impact of trade protectionist measures on the global value chain, geopolitical risks, and China’s financial 
stability concerns.  
Most central banks maintained their monetary policy stance and followed a data -dependent 
approach, while some central banks started to signal a dovish stance toward policy normalization. 
The U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) was expected to raise the policy rate once in 20191/ from the previous 
anticipation of two rate hikes. The European Central Bank (ECB) ended new bond purchases at the end of 
2018 according to its announced plan but continued rolling over matured bonds. The ECB was expected to 
keep the policy rate on hold throughout 2019 and implement a plan to increase liquidity in the financial 
system through targeted longer -term refinancing operations (TLTROs). Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) 
                                                
1/ This was an assessment as of 19 March 2019 before the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting at  
20 March 2019, with the tone of the statement dovish than the market expected.   
Monetary Policy Report March  2019  2 would maintain both short - and long -term interest rate targets for some period. Many central banks in the 
region, including the Bangko Sentral  ng Pilipinas and Bank Indonesia, maintained their policy rates after 
having continuously raised the rate in 2018. Other central banks such as the Bank of Korea, Bank Negara 
Malaysia, and the Reserve Bank of Australia kept their policy rates on hold due to  the outlook of economic 
slowdown, declining inflation, and uncertainties on trade protectionist measures.  
Emerging markets (EMs) experienced capital inflows after risks in the global financial market declined. 
This was due to the Fed’s dovish stance rega rding the monetary policy communications, improvements in 
trade negotiations between the U.S. and China, as well as lower risks of the no -deal Brexit during the 
beginning of the year. However, geopolitical risks affected investor confidence in certain peri ods. Looking 
ahead, the global financial market would remain highly volatile. International capital flows both into and out 
of EMs could fluctuate depending on monetary policy directions of advanced economies, prolonged 
uncertainties pertaining to U.S. -China trade protectionist measures, uncertainties regarding Brexit 
negotiations, political developments in the euro area as well as geopolitical risks.  
2. Financial Conditions and Financial Stability  
Thailand’s financial conditions remained accommodative.  The new loan rate remained stable at a low 
level despite the gradual increase of short -term government bond yields in line with the policy rate. 
Meanwhile, medium - and long -term government bond yields fluctuated due to both domestic and external 
factors. Pri vate credit expansion continued in both business and household sectors. Business sectors 
continued to raise fund through both bond and equity markets. The Thai baht appreciated against the U.S. 
dollar at the beginning of the quarter, consistent with other regional currencies, due to (1) a weaker U.S. 
dollar after the Fed’s dovish stance regarding the monetary policy communications, (2) a lower possibility of 
the no -deal Brexit during the beginning of the year, and (3) improvements in U.S. -China trade negoti ations. 
The baht appreciated to a larger extent as compared with other regional currencies given Thailand’s large 
current account surplus and investors associating the baht with low risks. In late February 2019, the baht 
depreciated against the U.S. dollar  due to better -than-expected outturns of some U.S. economic figures. 
Moreover, investors were concerned about geopolitical risks between the U.S. and North Korea as well as 
the general election in Thailand. Meanwhile, the real effective exchange rate (REER ) appreciated.  
There were some risks in the financial system that could pose vulnerabilities to financial stability in 
the future.  These risks included (1) an accumulation of household debt especially for auto and mortgage 
loans, (2) the search -for-yield behavior which persisted in the low interest rate environment and could lead 
to underpricing of risks, particularly among saving cooperatives and large corporates, and (3) risks in the 
property sector including uncertainties regarding Chinese demand for Th ai condominiums. There remained 
a need to monitor adjustments in the property market and mortgage loans after the revised macroprudential 
measure on mortgage loans were to be effective in April 2019.  
3. Economic and Inflation Outlook  
The Thai economy was projected to register slower growth at 3.8 and 3.9 percent in 2019 and 2020, 
respectively, down from the projection in the previous Monetary Policy Report . Growth drivers stemming 
from external demand were expected to moderate following the slowdown in tra ding partner economies and 
global trade volume. Merchandise and services export growth was thus expected to slow down. Meanwhile, 
domestic demand would remain a key growth driver.  
Merchandise exports were expected to slow down in line with global demand.  Export volume was 
projected to moderate in tandem with the outlook of trading partner economies and global trade volume. 
Looking ahead, Thailand’s merchandise exports would be supported by the relocation of production base in 
some industries to Thailand, r edirected orders from China to Thailand, and 5G technology -related infrastructure  
investment plans in many countries, which would benefit Thailand’s exports of electronics parts in the period 
ahead.   
Monetary Policy Report March  2019  3 Exports of services were projected to exhibit slower grow th mainly due to lower spending per head, 
despite a higher -than-expected number of foreign tourists.  The global economic slowdown could lead 
to lower spending per head, especially for Chinese tourists, and a shorter trip duration of European tourists. 
The projected number of foreign tourist arrivals was revised up to 40.4 and 42.0 million for 2019 and 2020, 
respectively. The upward revision was on the back of tourist confidence on improvements in Thailand’s 
safety standards and the extended exemption of vis a-on-arrival (VOA) fees until the end of April 2019.  
Private consumption was expected to be well maintained despite some moderation in durable goods 
which had accelerated significantly in 2018. Supporting factors included a continued improvement in 
househ old income for both farm and non -farm households, improved consumer confidence, and support 
from government policies. However, elevated household debt would weigh on consumption. In addition, the 
adoption of automation in place of labor in the production p rocess and inflation remaining at a low level would 
limit pressures on employers to increase wages, thus resulting in a gradual improvement in household 
purchasing power.  
Private investment, particularly investment in machinery and equipment, would contin ue to expand.  
Supporting factors included expansion in production capacity and the relocation of production base to 
Thailand for hard -disk drives and other industries affected by the trade protectionist measures between the 
U.S. and China, which would lend  support to Thai exports going forward. In addition, the private sector was 
expected to invest further in public -private partnership (PPP) investment projects.  
Public spending would continue to drive the economy , especially investment on transportation 
infrastructure including the dual -track railway and mass rapid transit projects. Nevertheless, public 
investment was projected to grow at a slower pace than previously assessed due to delays in some state -
owned enterprises’ infrastructure investment projects  and changes in the investment structure of some PPP 
projects to allow for greater investment by the private sector. Moreover, the budget allocation for 
replenishment of the treasury account balance for fiscal year 2020 was higher than expected, resulting in 
lower composition of capital and current expenditures.  
Inflation was expected to trend up consistent with the previous assessment . Fresh food prices were 
expected to rise on account of an intensified drought and would offset some decline in core inflat ion following 
the softening in economic activity. However, demand -pull inflationary pressures would subsequently slowly 
rise reflecting a gradual closing of the output gap in the period ahead. Thus, the Committee projected 
headline inflation to average 1.0  and 1.1 percent for 2019 and 2020, respectively, and core inflation 
to average 0.8 and 0.9 percent for 2019 and 2020, respectively.   
The growth projection was subject to downside risks  due to (1) lower -than-expected trading partner 
economic growth followi ng such as more intensified trade protectionist measures between the U.S. and 
China, uncertainties regarding Brexit negotiation, the U.S. import tariffs on automobiles and parts, and 
geopolitical risks; and (2) lower -than-expected private investment due to  political uncertainties. However, 
there was a possibility that the Thai economy would outperform the baseline projection  due to (1) 
less-than-expected slowdown of the Chinese economy due to government economic stimulus measures; 
(2) higher -than-expected d omestic demand as a result of (2.1) sooner -than-expected implementation of 
government infrastructure investment projects, PPP projects, and private investment, (2.2) a quick 
dissolving of political uncertainty, and (3) additional government measures to sup port private spending. 
Meanwhile, risks to the forecasts of headline and core inflation were expected to tilt downward in 
line with increased downside risks  to growth projections.  
 
 
  
Monetary Policy Report March  2019  4 1. Global Economy  
Major advanced economies were expected to grow at a sl ower rate . The U.S. economy 
mainly experienced a temporary impact from the government shutdown, while the euro area 
and Japanese economies moderated due to country -specific factors and global trade 
slowdown . 
The U.S. economy was projected to slow down  in the fourth quarter of 2018. Private 
consumption moderated in line with consumer confidence, which was partly a result of a sharp fall 
of stock indices. Meanwhile, some economic activities faced a temporary impact from the 
government shutdown in the first qu arter of 2019. The manufacturing sector would likely slow 
down, after having accelerated in building up inventories prior to the increase in import tariffs 
between the U.S. and China. However, strong labor market (Chart 1.1), high consumer 
confidence, as w ell as personal and corporate income tax cuts would be supporting factors for 
domestic demand to drive the U.S. economy in the period ahead. The euro area was projected 
to grow at a slower rate  because the new emission standard had a longer -than-expected i mpact 
on automobile production, low water levels of the Rhine River hindered merchandise exports from 
Germany, and political uncertainty in some countries, such as France and Italy, hampered 
confidence and economic activities. In addition, merchandise expo rts from the euro area 
decreased as global trade volume was affected from the trade protectionist measures between 
the U.S. and China, as well as the global economic slowdown. Nonetheless, the euro area were 
projected to expand on the back of private consu mption, as supported by labor markets that 
remained robust. The Japanese economy was expected to moderate  due to lower 
merchandise exports in response to global trade outlook. Going forward, the Japanese economy 
was expected to expand primarily on the back  of domestic demand with support from the labor 
market, government economic stimulus measures, and continuously accommodative monetary 
policy. Furthermore, private consumption was expected to accelerate prior to an increase in 
consumption tax in October 20 19. 
The Chinese economy slowed down due to a series of financial stability measures 
implemented in recent periods. Meanwhile, moderating global trade had a larger -than-
expected impact on other Asian economies .  
The Chinese economy was expected to slow down  slightly  due to a series of 
financial stability measures to curb debt in the economy implemented in recent periods.  
In addition, impacts from the U.S. trade protectionist measures on China’s merchandise 
exports were expected to be increasingly prominent in the period ahead, particularly from 
measures that were already imposed. However, the Chinese government’s growth -supportive 
measures, including accelerated infrastructure investment, tax deductions for businesses and 
households, and liquidity injection into the financial system by reducing the banks’ reserve 
requirement ratio (RRR), would help alleviate some adverse impacts and support the economy 
to expand around 6.0 -6.5 percent in 2019, consistent with the government’s target.  
Asian economies, excludin g Japan and China, were expected to exhibit slower 
growth.  Merchandise exports of several countries began to slow down in line with global trade 
volume, which was affected by the trade protectionist measures between the U.S. and China 
and the waning effect  of front -loading exports ahead of the full implementation of tariffs  
Monetary Policy Report March  2019  5 imposed by the U.S. and China (Chart 1.2). Looking ahead, merchandise exports would likely 
slow down in line with global trade volume. Nonetheless, Asian economies were expected to 
expan d on the back of domestic demand, as supported by strong labor markets, an increase 
in minimum wages in several countries, as well as fiscal stimulus through infrastructure 
investment projects along with measures to support low -income earners in some count ries. 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
The growth projection for Thailand’s trading partners was revised downward, but remained 
close to  its potential.  
Going forward, Thailand’s trading partner economies were expected to register 
slower growth than previously assessed in the previous Monetary Policy Report .  
The downward revision was due to lower -than-expected growth outturns during the fourth 
quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019 in several countries, which were affected by 
moderating global trade and aforementioned c ountry -specific factors. However, most trading 
partner economies would continue expanding around their potential levels, with private 
consumption and government spending as key growth drivers. The committee, thus, revised 
down the growth projection for Tha iland’s trading partners from 3.4 percent to 3.2 
percent in 2019 and expected growth in 2020 to be around this year’s growth of 3.2 
percent  (Table 1.1).  
There remained possibilities that growth of trading partner economies would 
underperform the baseline p rojection  due to prolonged uncertainties pertaining to trade 
negotiations between the U.S. and China, despite some improvement after the U.S. 
announced to delay the increase in tariffs on imported goods from China indefinitely, as well 
as uncertainties sur rounding Brexit negotiations. Other risks that still warranted monitoring 
included, first, uncertainties regarding impacts from trade protectionist measures on the global 
supply chain and business sentiment. Second, geopolitical risks remained, particularl y the 
denuclearization agreement between the U.S. and North Korea which had yet to materialize. 
Moreover, recurring tensions in other regions could heighten volatility in the global financial 
and commodity markets, especially through oil prices, and would,  in turn, affect the real 
economy. Moreover, there remained political uncertainties in Europe, for instance, the unrest 
in France and the election in Spain. Third, economic and financial concerns in China still

Most central banks maintained th eir monetary policy stance and followed a data -dependent  
approach, while some central banks signalled a more dovish stance toward policy normalization . 
 The U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) raised the policy rate 4 times in 2018 on account of  a 
robust economic g rowth and continuously tightening labor market. In 2019, the Fed was 
expected to be more dovish toward monetary policy normalization , raising the policy rate once  
instead of  two times as previously assessed2/. The dovish stance was on account of softening 
inflation prospects,  moderat ing global economic  outlook , and heightened volatility  in the 
financial market. Going forward , the Fed’s monetary policy would mainly follow a  
data-dependent approach. Meanwhile , the European Central Bank (ECB) communicated its  
monetary policy stance  in a more dovish manner. The ECB ended new bond purchases at  
the end of 2018 as previously announced , but continued rolling over matured bonds. The ECB 
was expected to keep the policy rate on hold throughout 2019, instead of until the second half 
of 2019 as previously expected . Moreover, the ECB would also  implement a plan to increase 
liquidity in the financial system through targeted longer -term refinancing operations (TLTROs) , 
starting from September 2019 until March 2021. Meanwhi le, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) would 
maintain both short - and long -term interst rate targets for some period. Many central banks in 
the region, including the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) and Bank Indonesia (BI) , began 
to maintain their policy rates in th e first quarter of 2019 after having continuously raised the 
policy rate in 2018. Other central banks , such as the Bank of Korea (BOK), Bank Negara 
Malaysia (BNM) and the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), kept their policy rate on hold due 
to the slowdown o f economic growth outlook since 2018, declin ing inflation and uncertainties 
on trade protectionist measures.

Monetary Policy Report March  2019  7 Emerging markets (EMs) experienced capital inflows following the Fed’s dovish stance  
in the monetary policy communications, easing concerns over t he U.S. -China trade 
protectionist measures, as well as lower risks of the no -deal Brexit at the beginning of 2019.  
Overall risks in the global financial market declined at the beginning of 2019 due to  
the Fed’s dovish stance regarding the monetary policy  communications, improvements in 
trade negotiations between the U.S. and China, as well as lower risks of the no -deal Brexit, 
as reflected by a substantial decline in VIX Index3/ (Chart 1.3). Investors, thus, increased their 
risk appetite and returned to i nvest continually in EM assets, particularly in equity markets, 
consistent with rising stock indices. However, geopolitical risks had an impact on investor 
confidence in some periods, such as tension between India and Pakistan and the abrupt end 
of the U.S .-North Korea summit.  
Looking ahead, the global financial market would remain highly volatile. International 
capital flows , both into and out of EMs , could fluctuate depending on monetary policy 
directions of advanced economies, prolonged uncertainties p ertaining to U.S. -China trade 
protectionist meaures, uncertainties regarding Brexit negotiations, political developments in 
the euro area , as well as geopoitical risks.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Crude oil prices in the first quarter of 2019 declined from the previous quar ter. Looking 
ahead, despite moderating demand for crude oil following the global economic slowdown, 
tightening crude oil supply would support oil prices .  
In the first quarter of 2019, the Dubai crude oil prices declined from the previous 
quarter.  Such dec line was owing to investors’ concerns over a softening outlook of the global 
economy. Besides, the U.S. Department of Energy also expected the U.S. crude oil production 
to rise in 2019 and 2020, due mainly to an increase in crude oil supply by shale oil pr oducers. 
However, oil prices gradually picked up since the middle of the first quarter of 2019,

Monetary Policy Report March  2019  8 as investors projected the global oil supply to tighten in the period ahead due to several factors 
including (1) a lower production capacity of the OPEC member s and allies according to the 
agreement to cut production, (2) the U.S. sanction against Venezuela, and (3) the end of 
sanction exemptions for some of Iran’s oil exports starting in the second quarter of 2019.  
The Committee thus maintained the projection for Dubai crude oil prices 
throughout the forecast horizon. Despite moderating demand for crude oil following 
the global economic slowdown, tightening oil supply would support oil prices.  
Therefore, the Committee maintained the projection for Dubai crude o il prices at 66.0 dollars 
per barrel in 2019 and 2020 (Chart 1.4). Moreover, there were risks that oil prices would 
be below the baseline projection, similar to those evaluated in the previous Monetary Policy 
Report . In the short run, crude oil prices coul d rise in certain periods due to uncertainties 
pertaining to the U.S. sanctions against Venezuela and Iran, which might have an impact on 
the projection of crude oil supply and investor sentiment. In the period ahead, there remained 
several factors which c ould pressure oil prices to stay below the baseline projection. These 
risks included a larger -than-expected global economic slowdown, a possibly faster -than-
expected increase in the U.S. shale oil production, the cut in oil production by OPEC members 
and a llies which could be lower than the agreement, as well as the enforcement of the new 
marine fuel regulations imposed by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) which might 
lower demand for high -sulpher crude oil including Dubai crude oil.

Monetary Policy Report March  2019  9 2. The Thai Economy  
2.1 Recent Developments  
The Thai economy continued to gain traction in the fourth quarter of 2018, mainly 
driven by domestic demand while external demand gradually improved.  
In the fourth quarter of 2018  the Thai economy expand ed 3.7 percent from the same 
period last year. The key driver was private consumption which continued expanding across 
almost all product categories. In addition, purchasing power of farm and non -farm households 
improved, partly thanks to higher output of major crops such as rice, tapioca, rubber, vegetables 
and fruit, and government measures aiming to re lieve costs of living of the lower income groups. 
Private investment accelerated, driven by investment in machinery and equipment, especially in 
vehicle an d transport equipment. Meanwhile, construction investment continued to expand, 
partly on account of public -private partnership (PPP) for the mass rapid transit projects. Public 
spending growth moderated somewhat due to a slight contraction in public invest ment in tandem  
with lower disbursement in the central government’s current -year and carry -over budget, partly 
as a result of government project review to comply with the master  plans under the National 
Strategy . With regard to external demand, merchandise exports expanded slightly on the back 
of increased exports of gold and some major manufacturing products such as metal products, 
auto parts, and sugar. However, some other exports  products were affected by the slowdown in 
trading partner economies, trade p rotectionist measures between the U.S. and China, as well 
as the down cycle of electronic products. As a result, overall export growth moderated. Export 
of services slightly improved in line with increased tourism revenues and higher numbers of 
tourists fi gures relative to the previous quarter. Overall, the Thai economy expanded 0.8 percent 
in the fourth quarter of 2018 after seasonal adjustment. The annual growth for 2018 was 4.1 
percent, an improvement over 4.0 percent in 2018.  
In the first quarter of 20 19, the Thai economy continued to gain momentum, as 
reflected by recent economic indicators. Key growth driver was domestic demand, as private 
consumption continued to expand on account of improved and more broad -based household 
income improvement  and gove rnment measures aiming to support low -income households. 
However, purchasing power of households would be constrained by elevated household debt 
that continued to trend up. Private investment expanded, especially investment in machinery 
and equipment.  Pub lic spending expanded on the back of both procurement of goods and 
services and compensation of civil servants, while public investment expanded in both the 
central government and state -owned enterprises.  Merchandise exports slowed down on 
account of trad ing partners’ economic slowdown and the U.S. trade protectionist measures.  
Export of services expanded mainly due to a higher number of Chinese, Indian, and Taiwanese 
tourists thanks to an extended exemption of visa -on-arrival (VOA) fees from January 13, 2019 
to April 30, 2019, the opening of new flight routes from China and India, and tourist confidence 
on improvements in Thailand’s safety standards.  
 
  
Monetary Policy Report March  2019  10 Overall employment level remained high. Non -agricultural  employment remained high and  
was more broad -based, while agricultural employment stabilized after a decline following 
the drought. Overall purchasing power continued to expand thanks to improvement in both 
farm and non -farm household income.  
The economic expansion contributed to  improvements in househo ld purchasing power 
and high employment (Charts 2.1 and 2.2). Employment of non -farm households remained 
high and more broad -based, particul arly the manufacturing sector. Employment in the service 
sector increased, while employment in the construction and commerce sectors remained high. 
The slowdown in merchandise exports since the end of 2018 had yet to significantly  impact on 
overall employment. However, some export -related sectors such as electronics and rubber 
products observed  overtim e labor hours, partly due to industry -specific factors such as the 
product cycle and the adoption of automation. Overall non -farm income continued to increase 
across sectors and income groups, particularly the middle -income and high -income households.  
 Employment of farm households  remained stable after a decline owing to the drought 
situation mainly in the Northeast region. Despite lower output of jasmine rice following the 
drought, overall farm income expanded due to output increase in some crops, less c ontraction 
in crop prices, and a constant rise in rice prices. In addition, government measures aiming to 
assist rice, rubber, and oil palm growers helped shore up purchasing power of farm households. 
Looking ahead to the first half of 2019, output of some  crops such as rice and fruits might reduce 
compared to last year. This is because there remained risk of drought due to the El Nino, which 
could lead to lower dam water levels than last year and low rainfalls during February -April 2019.   
The favorable labor market condition in the previous periods supported purchasing 
power and consumption of households in various aspects, including the number of employed 
workers, improvements in household income, and persistently low unemployment rates. 
Analyzing labor  market conditions could utilize a multitude of indicators to provide a 
comprehensive picture, for example, labor market sentiment, employer behavior, labor potential. 
This would help reflect structural problems in Thai labor market and lead to the appropr iate 
formulation of labor and economic policies going forward. (Box:  Implications of low 
unemployment rate in Thailand )

Monetary Policy Report March  2019  11 Headline inflation declined mainly due to the fall in energy prices and core inflation.  
Headline inflation  averaged at 0.50  
percent over the first two months of the first 
quarter of 2019, down from 0.84 percent in the 
previous quarter (Chart 2.3). The drop was due 
to declines in energy prices as domestic retail 
oil prices fell in line with global oil prices. On the 
other hand,  fresh food prices increased, mainly 
due to increased prices of pork and eggs as 
excess supply abated. Vegetable and fruit 
prices declined to a lesser degree as there were 
smaller supplies in the market.  
 Core inflation  averaged at 0.65 percent over the fi rst two months of the first quarter of 
2019, down from 0.71 percent in the previous quarter. Core inflation in the food category 
declined (Chart 2.4) due to slower increases in prices of processed foods and non -alcoholic 
beverages (Chart 2.5). Core inflati on in the non -food categories declined mainly due to a slower 
increase in house rents. In other categories, prices slowly increased as domestic demand 
gradually rose. Moreover, structural factors encompassing rising e -commerce trends, intensified 
price com petition, and lower production costs from higher production efficiency weighed down 
core inflation in non -food categories.  
 Short -term (one -year ahead) inflation expectations  according to the survey of 
businesses in February 2019 stood at 1.7 percent, down  from 1.9 percent in the previous 
quarter. Inflation expectations of professional forecasters in March 2019 stood at 1.5 percent, 
up slightly from 1.3 percent in the previous quarter. Long -term (five -year ahead) inflation 
expectations according to the surv ey of professional forecasters in October 2018 stood at 1.8, 
down from the previous survey (April 2018).

Monetary Policy Report March  2019  12  
Short -term money market rates and short -term government bond yields gradually rose in 
line with the policy rate.  Medium -term and long -term government bond yields fluctuated 
owing to external and domestic factors.   
In the first quarter of 2019, short -term 
money market rates  rose in line with the policy 
rate.Short -term government bond yields 
rose gradually (Chart 2.6) especially at the e nd 
of January, on account of higher supply of the 
Bank of Thailand’s 1 -day bonds. Yields on 
two- to three -year  government bonds  
were stable in the beginning of the quarter 
before falling slightly at the end of February 
(Chart 2.7) partly due to higher dem and by 
investors following the Ministry of Finance’s 
announcement of the first bond switching in 
FY2019. The source bonds accepted by the 
Ministry of Finance were due to mature in 
around 3 years. Yields on five -year and longer - 
term government bonds  rose g radually mainly 
on account of net sales by foreign investors. At 
times, these bond yields fluctuated in tandem 
with U.S. government bonds yields, influenced by 
positive developments in the U.S. -China trade  
negotiations and the outlook of global economic 
slowdown, and more dovish stance of monetary 
policy communicated by the Fed and the ECB .  
 Corporate bond yields slightly edged up in line with government bond yields in the first 
quarter of 2019. Meanwhile, credit spread4/ was stable after rising in the pr evious quarter.  Cost 
of financing through commercial banks , as represented in the new loan rate (NLR) 5/ remained 
stable at about 4.0 percent (Chart 2.8). Meanwhile, reference loan rates of commercial banks  
                                                
4/  A credit spread is the difference between corporate and government bond yields with the same tenure, reflecting 
an assessment on corporate bond issuers’ default risks.   
5/  NLR is calculated based on a weighted average of interest rates fo r new loan contracts extended by 14 Thai 
commercial banks (excluding consumer loans and loans to financial intermediaries). The data covers loans of value 
of 20 million baht or higher for all purposes and terms and  includes both secured and non -secured loa ns. Moreover, 
interest rates used in the calculation refer to the mid -rate between the lowest and the highest rates in each loan 
contract.

Private credit extended to both businesses and households continued to expand in line with 
the economic expansion.  
Private credit6/ in January 2019 expanded 5. 6 percent, the  same rate as in the fourth

credit lines such as real estate businesses. Household credit continued to rise across all loan 
purposes in line with strong private consumption growth (Chart 2.9 ).

Monetary Policy Report March  2019  14 The net issuance of corporate bonds  continued to increase in the fourth quarter of 2018 
and in Januar y 2019 relative to the previous quarter, mainly driven by corporate funding in the IT 
and telecommunication, retail and wholesale trade, and energy sectors. Overall, net corporate 
bond outstanding rose 17.4 percent from the same period of last year (Chart 2.10). Funding 
through the equity market continued to increase in the fourth quarter of 2018 and in January 
2019, particularly in the IT and telecommunication, real estate, and electronic component sectors.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Going forward, financial  
conditions w ere expected to remain 
accommodative . The real policy interest 
rate increased slightly but still remained 
accommodative and was moderate 
relative to other countries (Chart 2.11). 
Meanwhile, costs of financing through 
commercial banks, as reflected in the 
new loan rate (NLR), would stabilize at a 
low level. However, financial institutions 
were expected to tighten credit 
standards in the first quarter of 20197  , 
particularly for loans extended to large 
corporates owing to the outlook of 
economic slowdown and concerns over 
some industries. Meanwhile, credit standards for loans extended to households were also 
expected to be slightly tightened, particularly for auto and mortgage loans.

Monetary Policy Report March  2019  15 The baht appreciated against the U.S. dollar and the nominal effective exch ange rate (NEER) 
index also appreciated.  
In the first quarter of 2019, the baht appreciated against the U.S. dollar  relative to the 
end of the previous quarter (Chart 2.12).  In January, the baht appreciated against the U.S. 
dollar in line with the move ment of regional currencies due to the weakening U.S. dollar following 
the Fed’s monetary policy communications toward more dovish stance. Concerns over global 
economic uncertainties surrounding the no -deal Brexit also alleviated in the first quarter of 20 19. 
In addition, trade negotiations between the U.S. and China showed signs of positive 
developments. Despite net portfolio outflows of non-residents , primarily from the bond market 
(Chart 2.13), the baht appreciation was more pronounced than regional curr encies, partly due 
to Thailand’s large current account surplus. Also, the flash crash of U.S. securities prices in the 
beginning of January 2019 led to the appreciation of the yen and the baht which were regarded 
as safe -haven currencies. Since the end of February 2019, the baht weakened against the U.S. 
dollar due to better -than-expected outturns of major U.S. economic figures in the fourth quarter 
of 2018. Furthermore, there were concerns over geopolitical risks regarding an abrupt end of 
the U.S. -North K orea summit as well as the Thai general elections. Consequently on 19 March 
2019, the baht closed at 31.67 to the U.S. dollar, up 2.8 percent from the end of the previous quarter.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The nominal effective exchange rate 
(NEER) index  stood at 119.72 on 19 March 
2019, an appreciation of 2.1 percent from the 
end of the previous quarter. The movement was 
in line with the baht appreciation against 
currencies of most trading partners, except 
pound sterling (Chart 2.14). As the end of 
February 2019, the prelim inary real effective 
exchange rate (REER) index  rose about 2.4 
percent from the end of the previous quarter.

Monetary Policy Report March  2019  16 Going forward, exchange rates would likely remain volatile due to monetary policy 
directions of advanced economies, uncertainties over the U.S. a nd China trade protectionist 
measures, geopolitical risks, and the political situation in Thailand. Thus, businesses should 
regularly manage their foreign exchange risks in both directions through various instruments 
such as local currenc y invoicing , forei gn currency deposit accounts , and the foreign exchange 
forwards. (Box:  Building an ecosystem to foster resilience against exchange rate volatilities )  
Financial stability remained sound overall. However, there remained a need to monitor risks 
that might po se vulnerabilities to the financial system in the future. These included:  
(1) leveraged household debt and deteriorating credit quality of some categories, (2) search -
for-yield behavior amid persistently low interest rates which could lead to underpricing  of risks , 
particularly saving cooperatives and large corporates, and (3) risks in the real estate sector.  
Thailand’s financial stability remained 
sound overall.  External stability continued to 
be strong, as indicated by the country’s high 
level of inte rnational r eserves and sustained 
current account surpluses, while the external 
debt to GDP ratio remained low.8/ These 
factors combined to cushion the Thai 
economy against volatilities in global financial 
markets. Financial institutions maintained 
robust f inancial positions, as reflected in high 
levels of capital buffers to cushion against 
risks stemming from deterioration in credit 
quality. Nevertheless, there remained pockets  
of risks that warranted monitoring going 
forward. Such risks were as follows . 
 (1) Leveraged household debt would continue, while debt serviceability of some 
household groups and small enterprises continued to deteriorate. The ratio of household 
debt to GDP rose slightly from the previous quarter to 77.9 percent in the third quarter o f 2018 
(Chart 2.15) and remained elevated compared with other emerging economies. 9/ Sustained 
accumulation of  household debt was a structural problem  that should be urgently recognized  
and  resolved. (Box: Financial disciplines of Thai households and the  BOT’s role in mitigating 
the household debt problem ). In particular , household debt would continue to rise due to the 
following factors: (1) a continued expansion of auto loans since the second quarter of 2017 in 
tandem with increased car sales, partly du e to sales promotions and more lenient credit 
standards on auto loans in the previous periods, and (2) the uptrend in mortgage loans before 
the macroprudential measure on mortgage loans were to be effective. Besides, persistently low 
interest rates induced  households to incur new debts, which could weigh on future consumption 
and debt serviceability and result in limited  households’ cushion against economic volatilities.   
Overall credit quality remained stable, partly as a result of debt restructuring and 
delinquent debt write -offs, as indicated by the NPL ratio of commercial banks in the fourth 
                                                
8/ The latest data as of Q4 2018 was 35.3 percent.  
9/ The ratio of household debt to GDP was around 40 percent among emerging economies in 2018.

remained high at 3.3 percent. Meanwhile, NPL ratios of auto loans and cre dit card loans started 
to trend up since the second half of 2018, which indicated that credit quality had yet to show 
clear signs of improvement. Financial positions of some small enterprises remained fragile, 
particularly those in the construction and uti lities sectors. These were reflected in  the sustained 
negative operating profit margins  (OPM) and interest coverage ratio (ICR) of small companies10/ 
which were consistent with the NPL ratio of commercial banks’ SME loan portfolios which 
remained high at 4. 5 percent. 11/     
 (2) The continued search -for-yield behavior under the environment of persistently 
low interest rates could lead to underpricing of risks. Although systemic risk remained 
limited, there were issues that warranted close monitoring.  Such risks included, first, a search -
for-higher -yield behavior of saving cooperatives. As a result, assets and deposits of saving 
cooperatives continued to expand at a high rate (Chart 2.16) despite slowing somewhat after 
regulatory authorities collaborated to enhance supervision standards. Moreover, credit risk and 
liquidity risk warranted close monitoring owing to higher short -term borrowings by some large 
saving cooperatives for investment in financial instruments. In addition, increased borrowings 
among savi ng cooperatives heightened their interconnection, resulting in increased systemic 
risks in the saving cooperatives sector. Second, large corporates having significant 
connectedness with the financial system increasingly raised funds through bond and equity  
markets given a prolonged period of low interest rates. Those corporates with high debts were 
in the service, manufacturing, and utilities sectors. Furthermore, many of these corporates 
expanded foreign investments, particularly holding companies. The bus iness structures of such 
businesses had become increasingly complicated, resulting in more difficult risk assessment 
and possibly underpricing of risks. Third, although offshore investments through foreign 
investment funds (FIF) had contracted somewhat in the recent period due to concerns over 
volatilities in global financial markets, FIF investments started to rise in February 2019 relative 
to the same period last year. Concentration risks still warranted monitoring as FIF investments 
were concentrated in only five major countries.

(3) Risks in the real estate sector such as risk pertaining to foreign, particularly 
Chinese, demand for condominiums. In 2018, foreign demand for condominiums in Thailand 
continued to grow, as reflected in the value of  foreign funds transferred for condominium 
purchase amounting to 92 billion baht, up 30.3 percent from the same period last year. The 
majority of these foreign buyers were Chinese, accounting for 43 percent of total foreign funds 
transferred (Chart 2.17). Consequently, risks regarding possible decline in Chinese demand 
warranted monitoring as it could result in an oversupply and liquidity problems of real estate 
developers. In particular, the U.S. -China trade protectionist measures could lead to an economic  
slowdown in China, and political uncertainties in Thailand could affect decision of Chinese 
buyers. Furthermore, real estate developers viewed that a decline in Chinese demand would 
affect tourist destinations such as Chiangmai and Phuket at a greater deg ree than Bangkok and 
its vicinities as it would be more difficult to find substitution for Chinese demand in such area. 
Besides,  there remained a need to monitor the impact of the revised macroprudential 
measure  on mortgage loans12/ regarding the adjustment  of the property market and mortgage 
loan quality. The regulations were to be effective on 1 April 2019.

Monetary Policy Report March  2019  19  Implications of low unemployment rate in Thailand  
A ranking by the World Bank in 2018 reveals that Thailand’s unemployment rate  of 1.1% 
was the 9th lowest out of 233 countries worldwide . Such low unemployment rate may reflect the 
tightness of the Thai labor market following a solid economic growth in recent periods.  However,  it 
may not reveal structural problems in the Thai labor market. Hence, this article aims to analyze 
implications of Thailand’s low unemployment rate in 3 main aspects, namely  
1) definition s of unemployment rate  in Thailand and the international standard , 2) structural 
problems in the Thai labor market that are  not reflected in unemployment figure s, and  
3) alternative indicators to assess the Thai labor market in a wider scope . 
1. Definition s of unemployment rate  in 
Thailand and the international standard  
The International Labour Organization 
(ILO) defines the  unemployed  as all persons  
who  are  without  work  or work  less  than  one  
hour  per  week.  This definition is adopted  by 
countries all over  the world including Thailand. 
However, the U.S. has added to the definition 
to include those  who work for family businesses  
without any compensation  and work  for less 
than 15 hours per week. Using the U.S. 
definition, Thailand’s unemployment rate will 
edge up from 1.1 percent to  1.5 percent, 
which is still considered very low compared 
to 4 percent of the U.S. (Chart 1).  
2. Structural problems in the Thai labor market  
The low unemployment rate in Thailand cannot  reflect the following 4 structural problems in 
the Thai labor market.  
First problem  Some workers have unstable  jobs. 
In terms of work status , most workers in the agricu ltural sector, which constitutes  
nearly one -third of the labor force, are self -employed and are not in the social  security system . 
Thus, they may not have access to significant  
social benefits for, such as childbirth, childcare, 
disabilities, death, or une mployment  (Chart 2). 
For workers in the non -agricultural sector, one -
third of non-agricultural  workers are not in the 
social securit y system . This is particularly the 
case for workers in the trading sector, where 
most of the firms are  small firms that face high 
competition and are financially vulnerable . 
Examples of these firms include retail 
businesses , street stalls, mom -and-pop shops, 
or stalls in front of shops .

2018Workers in agricultural sector  by work status  (seasonally adjusted) 
Monetary Policy Report March  2019  20  Second problem  Some  workers in the agricultural sector are underemployed13/. 
The average working hours  of the agricultural sector is 36 hours per week, which is lower 
than the average of non -agricultural sector at 46 hours per week , and average s of each non -
agricultural sector (Chart 3). Furthermore, the number  of workers in the agricultural se ctor who work 
less than 35 hours per week and prefer to work more is larger than that of the non -agricultural sector. 
Taken together, a larger number  of agricultural workers , compared to non -agricultural workers , is 
underemployed . Therefore, difficulties for agricultural workers to relocate to other economic activities 
reflect a structural problem in the Thai labor market . 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Third problem  Some workers have  given  up seeking  jobs and are therefore excluded from  
the labor force . 
The low unemployment rate is partly due to the early retirement of  some workers  who 
are thus not  counted in  the labor force.  This  can be observed in the rising number of houseworkers 
out of the labor force with  age between 51 and 60 (Chart 4). However, it is likely that some of the se 
people have attempted to seek a new  job  for  some  time  before  giving  up and  becoming  
discouraged  workers , which are neither considered as unemployed nor part of the labor force. 
Unlike surveys  in developed countries , Thailand’s labor force survey is stil l unable to separate 
discouraged workers from those out of  the  labor force. Thus, Thailand’s  unemployment rate 
calculated based on this data is relatively lower than if discouraged workers were to be categorized 
as unemployed and part of the labor force.  
Fourth problem  Some workers  confront skill mismatch  given their education al levels or 
fields of studies.  
Although workers  are employed, if their jobs do not match their qualifications, they might 
not be able to reach their full potential. A study reveals that 1 in 10 of non-agricultural workers  in 
Thailand  is underpaid given his or her educational level , since  the job does not match his or her 
skills . In other words, worker experiences a job mismatch with regard to both educational  levels 
(vertical mismatc h) and fields of study (horizontal mismatch). Among various fields of study, job 
mismatch is found to be most  common among social science graduates.  
3. Alternative indicators to assess  the Thai labor market  in a wider scope  
 Given four structural problems above, it is clear that the unemployment rate alone is not 
sufficient to capture all aspects of labor market development . Thus, other indicators are

Monetary Policy Report March  2019  21 necessary to monitor additional aspects of the overall Thai labor market, including the following 3 
dimen sions.  
1) Labor market confidence, such as business employment outlook which  represents 
confidence among employers  
2) Employers’ behavior, such as the number of workers who work more than 50 hours per 
week. More workers working  overtime imply a higher dem and for labor and signals tightness in the 
labor market.   
3) Labor market utilization , such as the number of unemployed workers without job 
experiences . This reflects whether the labor force is fully utilized.  
Chart 5 shows labor  market  cyclical indicators , which can be used to assess the 
overall Thai labor market in wider dimensions . For example, the Thai labor market in the fourth  
quarter of 2018 improved in many dimensions. Labor market utilization  was close to a historical 
average, while  employment was  expected to increase further thanks to confidence in economic 
growth outlook. Moreover, employment for overtime  work rose in the manufacturing sector  in order to 
meet higher demand. Nevertheless, demand for low -skill workers continued to fall.  
In summary , Thailand’s unemployment rate is calculated in accordance with the 
international standard  definition. However, unemployment rate that remains low does not reflect 
structural problems that plague the Thai labor market. For example, some workers do not work  to 
their full potential, while others have given up seeking  jobs and are thus excluded from the labor 
force. Hence, monitoring various dimensions of labor  market development through labor market 
cyclical indicators  will allow for a more comprehensive unde rstanding of the market, and thus 
economic policy formations will be based on a more comprehensive data set .

Monetary Policy Report March  2019  22 Building an ecosystem to foster resilience against exchange rate volatilities  
Amidst growing uncertainties and volatilities in the  global  financia l market today,  the Bank of 
Thailand (BOT) recognizes the importance of building a financial ecosystem that could  foster  
resilience against volatilities of exchange rates and capital flows. The objective is to ensure that Thai 
firms are able  to manage exchange rate risks appropriately  and on a regular basis. This can be done 
through the following ways.  
1. Local currency invoicing This reduces risks from volatilities of major currencies. The BOT 
encourages  firms the practice of invoicing in Th ai baht or in currencies of major regional trad ing 
partners , as alternative currencies  apart from  U.S. dollar . This will help reduce  risks from reliance 
on U.S. dollar , which has been highly volatile in recent periods. In 2018, as much as 76.9 percent of 
Thai export  value  was invoiced in U.S. dollar  (Chart 1), although the actual trade with the U.S. only 
accounted for 10 percent.  
Therefore, the BOT has been promoting  the use of local currenc ies, starting from 
Thailand’s key regional trading partners , namely  China and Japan. In collaboration with  central 
banks of China and Japan, the BOT has promoted the use of direct quotations between  baht-yuan 
and baht -yen among commercial banks in respective countries. This is in order to increase liquidity 
of local curr encies in foreign exchange markets, and reduce spread  costs. Furthermore, the BOT 
has now extended collaborations to other countries in the region , such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and 
CLMV countries.  
The collaborations above have helped lower cost s of exch anging local currencies, 
prompting  firms a greater  use of local currency . As a result, the share of Thai exporters that 
used  Thai baht  invoicing has grown from 11.1 percent in 2013 to 15.6 percent in 2018 (Chart 1).  
This is particularly observed in expor ts to New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, and Russia (Chart 
2), where significant shares of Thai automobile exports  were recorded  (Chart 3). The use of Thai 
baht as invoicing currency for automobile  exports is higher than other export products  (Chart 4) , 
partly due to  exchange rate risk management policy of their parent  companies. Moreover, the share 
of Thai baht invoicing  is high among Thailand’s exports to ASEAN countries, especially Myanmar 
and Laos. Since Thailand is the Chair of ASEAN  for 2019, the BOT will take this opportunity to 
promote a wider use of local currencies . Therefore , all ASEAN members will recognize benefits, 
and support  the use of local currenc ies for  regional trade and investement. This will ultimately foster 
a greater financial inte rconnectedness in the region.

2. Foreign currency deposits (FCD) Firms with foreign exchange obligations  in the future  
can deposit  their foreign currenc ies in FCD accounts in order to reduce risks from exchange rate 
volatilities . The BOT has published the deposit rates and transaction fees of FCD accounts of each 
commercial bank  on its website , so that firms can conveniently compare information across  banks. 
According to the latest data, Thai firms have relied increasingly on FCD accounts for the payment 
of goods and services. Particularly, in 2018 , the number of Thai firms that used FCD accounts for 
payment  and receipt  of goods and services increased by 17 percent from the previous year.  
3. Foreign exchange  hedging instruments such as FX forwa rds and FX options. Recently in 
2017, the BOT, in collaboration with government agencies and commercial banks, has launched 
the “Foreign Exchange Risk Management Program for SMEs”  to enhance understanding s among 
SMEs on how to use FX options to mitigate fo reign exchange risks. In the second phase of the 
project, which started in November 2018, the sponsored premium for the purchase of FX options 
has been raised from 30,000 baht to 50,000 baht per business entity. Furthermore, the BOT has 
published the avera ge forward points quoted by commercial banks  on its website . This will enhance 
transparency and provide useful information for firms that consider engaging in  FX forward  contracts  
with commercial bank s. Overall, the effort will facilitate Thai firms by off ering a greater  variety of 
foreign exchange hedging instruments . 
In addition to supporting Thai firms to be immuned from exchange rate volatitilies,  the 
BOT also recognizes the importance of faciliating more balanced capital flows . 
In recent periods, susta ined current  account surplus has led to constant  capital inflows into 
Thailand. Against this backdrop, the BOT has provided greater convenience for residents’  outflows, 
both in the form of outward direct investment and portfolio  investment. Th e objective is to balance 
between capital inflows and outflows, as well as increase opportunities for Thai investors to 
enhance returns and diversify risks. To this end , the BOT has introduced a series of regulatory 
reform since 2017  according to the “FX Regulations Re form” roadmap . These are, for 
example, streamlining procedures  and reducing  documents required for transferring money abroad, 
promoting transactions in electronic forms , and removing foreign  exchange transaction forms (FX 
forms). Moreover, firms under specified qualifications can apply as a qualified company (QC), which 
allows them to conduct  foreign exchange transactions with the commercial bank  without any 
underlying documents  for more convenien ce in  foreign currency  management . Meanwhile, Thai 
investors with more than 50 million baht in total assets can apply as a qualified investor (QI), which 
enables them to directly invest in offshore securities with out a need to invest through local 
investment agents , expand ing their options in foreign investment .

Monetary Policy Report March  2019  24   Financial disciplines of Thai households   
and the BOT’s role  in mitigating  the household  debt problem  
Thailand’s  household  debt is a key issue  that the Bank  of Thailand  has placed great emphasis  
on and monitored  constantly  in recent  years .Currently, househ old debt totals  approximately 78  
percent  of GDP, which is relatively  high compared  to the average  of only 40 percent  among  emerging  
market  countries . Furthermore, household  debt has appeared  to accelerate  once  again  since  the 
second  half of 2017. Against  this backdrop, this  article  summarizes  the debt behaviors  of Thai 
households  based  on two recent  studies . The first one is a study  by the Puey  Ungphakorn  Institute  
for Economic  Research  that finds that “Thai people  are indebted  at an earlier  age, remaining  so 
for longer, and  in a larger amount than before .” The second  study  is part of a research  project  
on Thailand’s  household  debt problem  and the policy  implications . It finds that “financial  discipline  
is one of  the crucial  factors behind Thailand’s  househo ld debt problem ”. The policy  
implications  from the study  are that collaborations  from all parties  are necessary  to solve  such 
problem, and  that government  policy  will be ineffective  should  households  do not recognize  the 
importance  of financial  disciplines .  
Thai people  are indebted  from an earlier  age, remaining  so for longer, and  in a larger amount 
than before . 
 A study  by the Puey  Ungphakorn  Institute  for Economic  Research14/ reveals  the following  
findings  based  on an analysis  of the National  Credit  Burea u data.  
(1) Thai people  are indebted  from  an earlier  age and have  delinquent loans  when they 
are juvenile . More  than half of the working  population  aged  25-35 years  old incur  consumer  
or credit  card debts . Consequently , this  age group  has the highest  proportion  of indebted  
individuals . In terms  of debt quality, one-fifth of  borrowers  from  this age group  have  delinquent 
loans .  
(2) Thai people are remaining indebted for longer periods.  The size of debt per person 
tends to surge from the age of late 20s to 3 0 years old, and remains elevated throughout the 
individual’s working time. Moreover, the debt burden does not seem to fall when the individual 
reaches retirement, suggesting the lack of financial security among Thais.  
(3) Thai people incur a larger amoun t of debts than before.  The median size of debt per 
person has more than doubled within six years, from 70,000 baht per person in 2010 to around 
150,000 baht per person at the end of 2016.  
 Furthermore, over 16 percent of indebted individuals, or around t hree million people, are 
more than 90 days behind on their debt repayments. These are considered delinquent loans, and 
are therefore subject to debt collections or in the legal process. Such a large share of delinquent 
loans reflects financial vulnerabilit ies among Thai people, and suggests that a significant part of the 
population is trapped in a cycle of indebtedness that resulted in part from the lack of financial 
discipline and financial literacy.  
 
 
 
                                                
14/ Sommarat Chantarat et al. (201 ) “Thailand’s household debt through the lens of credit bureau data: debt and 
delinquency” aBRIDGEd No. 10 201  Puey Ungphakorn Institute for Economic Research.   
Monetary Policy Report March  2019  25 Financial  discipline  is one of the  crucial  factors b ehind  Thailand’s  household  debt problem . 
Part of the research  project  on Thailand’s  household  debt problem  and policy  implications15/ 
is aimed at understanding the perspectives  towards debt formation and the spending behaviors 
among Thai households. A surve y conducted on 1,500 households across the country reveals the 
following insights.  
 (1)  Most  Thai households  perceive  that “financial  discipline” plays  a key role  in both  
the cause s and the solutions  of indebtedness . Households  become  indebted  mainly  because  
their income  falls short  of their expenditures,  which linked  directly  to the lack of financial  discipline, 
especially  the absence  of consistent  saving . At the same  time, most  households  realize that financial  
discipline, financial  literacy, and  debt restructuring  would  help alleviate  household  debt problem  
(Chart  1).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (2) Indebted  households  tend to be less cautious in  spending  than those  without  
debts16/ Compared  to other  households, indebted  ones  spend  at a larger amount overall, particu larly 
on travel  expenses, telephone  services, and utilities . In addition, they  tend to purchase assets  
reflecting social status  such as housing  and automobiles, compared  to households  without  debts .  
 (3) Indebted  households  with financial  problems  often  lack financial planning16/. 
Indebted  households  with financial  problems  are three to five  times  more  likely  to engage  in 
overspending  behaviors  on items  such as clothing  and recreations, compared  to indebted  households  
without  financial problems . Moreover, illnesses  of family members  as reflecting in high healthcare  
expenditures  are among  the major  factors causing households’ liquidity  problems.  Hence, financial  
planning  and saving  for emergency  are both crucial and  necessary  for households’ financial  securi ty.

Monetary Policy Report March  2019  26  The BOT’s roles  in mitigating  the household  debt problem  
The BOT recognizes  the importance  of the  household  debt problem, a structural  issue  
that needs  to be addressed  urgently . The economy  driven  by indebtedness, especially  consumer  
debts, will  be unsustainable, and  lead to a build -up of vulnerabilities in the long run. Furthermore , higher  
debt burden  weigh  on households’ purchasing  power, preventing  the economy  from expanding  at its 
potential . The two conclusions  from the first part of this article  suggest  that household  debt problem  
cannot  be tackled  only by debt reduction, debt extension, or  the extension of the repayment period  
suspension,  but also the adjustments in the spending  behaviours  and financial  discipline  among  
households . To drive such adjustments, the  BOT has implemented  measures  in the following  three  
dimensions .  
First  dimension : Banking  supervision  emphasizes  responsible  lending  among  
financial  institutions . Financial  institutions  must  not encourage  over-borrowing  among  borrowers, 
as irresponsible  credit  extension  will ultimately  lead to higher delinquent loans . To enhance responsible  
lending, the  BOT has tightened  rules  governing  credit  card loans, personal  loans, mortgage  loans, 
and car-for-cash loans . Furthermore,  the supervision  of financial  products  marketing  has been  
upgraded  such that banks  are required to disclose adequate  and accurate  information  regarding  their 
financial  products . In addition, the  interest  rates  charged  must  not be at an unusual  high level to 
ensure that clie nts are treated fairly and their debt serviceabilities are not affected .   
Second dimension: Resolving the problem of debt overhang through Debt Clinic. Debt 
Clinic is a collaboration between the Bank of Thailand, The Thai Bankers’ Association, The 
Associa tion of International Banks, and the Sukhumvit Asset Management Co. Ltd. (SAM). The 
objective of the Debt Clinic is to seek a solution for reliable borrowers who determine to change their 
habits to ultimately get out of their debt cycles. The first phase o f the program was emphasized on 
credit card and uncollateralized personal loans. With SAM serving as an intermediary between 
debtors and creditors, the Debt Clinic offers  multi-creditor debt restructuring program as a one -stop-
service. Based on the latest information as of December 2018, the Debt Clinic has completed 1,067 
cases of debt restructuring. Set to begin in the second quarter of 2019, the scheme’s second phase 
will allow debtors of credit card and personal loans from non -bank companies to access s uch 
program.  
Third  dimension : Continuously promoting  financial  literacy  and financial  discipline . 
Financial  literacy  and financial discipline  can encourage customers to avoid overspending, design  
effective  financial  plan, as well as alert to the  fast-chan ging landscape  of financial  products . Recently  
in 2018 , the targeted consumers were  the generation -Y, such  as vocational  students  and first 
jobbers . In order to prepare  them  for future  challenges, the BOT aimed to  cultivate  prudent  financial  
behaviors as w ell as  foster  financial  immunity and skill . This project  was thanks  to supports  from the 
Thai Bankers’ Association, The  Office  of the Vocational  Education  Commission, the  Foundation  of 
Virtuous  Youth, and  other  partner  organizations .  
 To this end, althoug h the government  has introduced  several measures  to curb household  
debt, should  households  still lack of financial  discipline  which  is at the root of the problem, these  
government  measures  will be rendered  ineffective . Therefore, tackling  the household  debt 
challenges  must  begin at the household level . Should  all Thai individual s are equipped with financial  
literacy and financial discipline, the financial stability will be strengthened, which  will ultimately  
support stable economic growth going forward .  
 
  
Monetary Policy Report March  2019  27  2.2 Outlook for the Thai Economy  
Under the Committee’s assessment, the Thai economy was projected to record a 
slower growth rate at 3.8 percent in 2019, lower than the projection of 4.0 percent in the 
previous Monetary Policy Report . Key growth drivers st emming from external demand, which 
moderated in line with a slowdown in trading partners’ economic growth and global trade 
volume, caused merchandise and services exports to decelerate from the previous assessment.  
Meanwhile , the Thai economy was projected  to expand 3.9 percent  in 2020 , underpinned 
by domestic demand as a key driver. The projection for headline inflation in 2019 was close to 
the previous estimate of 1.0 percent, while that of core inflation in 2019 was slightly below the 
previous assessment  due to lower demand -pull inflationary pressures in response to a softening 
economic outlook.  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Summary of the key forecast assumptions  
 Trading partner economies  were projected to slow down throughout the forecast horizon due to lower -
than-expected growth outturns in the fourth quarter of 2018 and in the first quarter of 2019 in several  
countries. Exports were undermined by the trade protectionist measures  between the U.S. and China , 
coupled with country -specific factors including the tempora ry government shutdown in the U.S. and 
political uncertainties in Europe.  
 The federal funds rate , consistent with a more dovish stance of the Fed’s monetary policy  
communications, was projected to  be raised  only once during the second half of 2019, instead  of two 
times as previously estimated . The Fed was also expected to maintain the policy rate throughout 2020.  
 Asian currencies (excluding the Chinese yuan)  were expected to appreciate throughout the forecast 
horizon due to stronger -than-expected outturns d uring the first quarter of 2019. In the period ahead, 
regional currencies would gradually and slowly appreciate due to  a slower monetary policy 
normalization of the U.S.  
 The Dubai crude oil price projection was maintained. Despite moderating demand for cru de oil 
following the global economic slowdown, tightening oil supply due to a production cut according to the 
OPEC agreement and Venezuela’s lower oil production would support oil prices.  
 Farm income  was revised upward mainly on account of a higher agricul tural output . Meanwhile, overall 
agricultural prices were expected to contract by a smaller degree, thanks to higher prices of rice, rubber 
and pork.  
 Public spending at current prices were revised downward throughout the forecast horizon  for both 
public c onsumption and investment. The downward revision was due to delays in infrastructure  
investment projects of some state -owned enterprises, changes in the investment structure of some 
PPP projects to allow for greater investment by the private sector, as wel l as the more -than-expected

Merchandise exports were expected to slow down in line with moderating global economy  
and global trade volume.  
The value of Thailand’s merchandise exports in 2019 was projected to slow down . 
Export volume moderated mainly on account of a softening outlook of  trading partner  economie s 
and global trade volume. Weaker exports of some industries were expected to continue , including 
rubber, automobile, integrated circuits, and telecommunications  equipment, as reflected by a 
contraction in their  export s in January 2019. Moreover, the World Trade Outlook Indicator17/ in the 
first quarter of 2019 displayed a sluggish trend. However, in the period ahead , Thai exports would 
be supported by the relocation of some hard -disk drive and air -condition ing businesses to 
Thailand, redirected orders from China to Thailand such as f or electronic parts, automobile tyres,  
as well as televisions, and also by  the 5G technology -related infrastructure investment plans in 
many countries, which would benefit Thailand’s exports of electronic parts in the period ahead . 
The Committee thus proje cted the value of merchandise exports in 2019 to grow at  3.0 
percent, down from the previous estimate of 3.8 percent in the previous Monetary Policy 
Report . In 2020, the value of merchandise exports was expected to expand at 4.1  percent.  
Exports of service s were projected to exhibit slower growth mainly due to lower spending 
per head.  
Overall e xports of services were projected to exhibit slower growth mainly due to 
lower spending per head , despite a higher -than expected number of foreign tourists.   
The glo bal economic slowdown led to lower spending per head, as observed in  lower spending 
per head by Chinese tourists , particularly on luxurious goods. This was in tandem with Chinese 
tourists spending in other countries. In addition, the slowdown of the euro area economy resulted 
in a shorter trip duration of European tourists. However, the projected number of foreign tourist 
arrivals was revised upward on the back of  tourist confidence on improvements in Thailand’s

Monetary Policy Report March  2019  29 safety standards and benefits from the extend ed exemption of visa -on-arrival (VOA) fees until 
the end of April 2019 , particularly for tourists from China, India and Taiwan. As a result,  
the projected number of foreign tourists in 2019 was revised up to 40.4 million from the previous 
estimate of 40.0  million, while in 2020, the number of foreign tourists was forecasted  to be 
42.0 million .  
The current account was projected to record a 34.5 billion U.S. dollar s surplus in 
2019, close to the estimated surplus in the previous Monetary Policy Report . The estimate 
was in tandem with a decline in the value of both merchandise exports and imports. Meanwhile , 
the projection for the current account surplus in 2020 was 31.5 billion U.S. dollars , a smaller 
surplus as import value was expected to accelerate in lin e with outlook of private investment .  
Private consumption was expected to be well maintained.  
Private consumption was expected to be well maintained  despite some moderation 
in durable goods, especially automobiles  which had accelerated significantly in 2 018. Supporting 
factors included a continued improvement in  both farm and non -farm household  income, 
improved consumer confidence, and government policies which would support household 
consumption such as the welfare card scheme. Nonetheless, elevated hous ehold debt would 
affect households to allocate part of their  income for debt repayment, especially among  
low-income households , and somewhat weigh on private consumption. Moreover, the adoption 
of automation in place of labor and inflation remaining at a low level would limit pressures on 
employers  to increase wages , thus resulting in a gradual improvement in household purchasing 
power in the period ahead.  
Private invest would continue to expand.  
Private investment, particularly investment in machinery an d equipment, would 
continue to expand. Drivers would come from  both upgrade s to production  efficiency and capacity  
expansion,  as well as the relocation of production base to Thailand for hard-disk drive , which was  
according to the original investment plan  and the PPP infrastructure investment projects in the 
Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC). Moreover, additional relocations of production base to Thailand 
for many industries affected by the trade protectionist measures  between the U.S. and China were 
expected , which would lend support to Thai exports going forward. In addition, private investment 
was projected to expand further  in 2020 thanks to changes in the investment structure of the public -
private partnership for the Orange Line  mass rapid transit project  between Bangkhunnon and 
Thailand Cultural Center , which  would be undertaken by the private sector.  
Public spending would continue to drive the economy.  
Public spending would continue to drive the economy, especially investment in  
transportation infrastr ucture , including the dual -track railway and mass rapid transit 
projects.  Nonetheless, public investment was projected to grow at a slower pace than 
previously assessed due to delays in some projects.  For state -owned enterprises, the high -
speed rail projec t between Bangkok and Nakhornratchasima was postponed  as it was during 
the process of contract reviews , while  the Orange Line mass rapid transit project between 
Bangkhunnon and Thailand Cultural Center underwent changes in the investment structure of 
the p ublic-private partnership  to allow for greater investment by the private sector . For the central 
government, government  investment continued to be affected by a reduction in  the construction  
Monetary Policy Report March  2019  30 budget and extended construction periods of the Bang  Yai-Kanchana buri motorway project due 
to problems regarding access into construction areas.  Moreover, public expenditure was revised 
downward since  the budget allocation for replenishment of the treasury account balance for 
fiscal year 2020 was higher than expected, r esulting in lower composition of capital and current 
expenditures.  
The projection of headline inflation was close to the previous assessment, while core inflation 
was projected to decline  slightly.  
Headline inflation projection was at a level 
close to th e estimate in the previous 
Monetary Policy Report.  Energy prices still 
faced upward pressures due to tightening 
crude oil supply , which would compensate 
for a decrease in demand in tandem with 
the global economic slowdown. Meanwhile, 
fresh food prices were  expected to rise as 
the drought condition  might intensify , the 
excess supply of pork and eggs alleviated, 
and prices of unmilled jasmine rice 
remained elevated. On the other hand, the 
projection of core inflation was revised 
downward due to lower -than-expected outturns in January and February 2019 and a softening 
economic  outlook. However, demand -pull inflationary pressures would subsequently slowly  rise 
reflecting a gradual closing of the output gap in the period ahead (Chart 2.18). Thus, the 
Committee pr ojected headline inflation to average 1.0 and 1.1 percent for 2019 and 2020, 
respectively, and core inflation to average 0.8 and 0.9 percent for 2019 and 2020, 
respectively.   
Growth and inflation projections were still subject to downside risks.  
Under the Committee’s assessment, growth projection was subject to downside 
risks , as reflected by the fanchart that tilted downward throughout the forecast horizon (Chart 
2.19). Possibilities that the Thai economy would underperform the baseline projection  
included  (1) lower -than-expected trading partner economic growth following more intensified 
trade protectionist measures between the U.S. and China, uncertainties regarding Brexit 
negotiation s, the U.S. import tariffs on automobiles and parts, and geopolitical ris ks; and  
(2) lower -than-expected private investment due to political uncertainties. However, there were 
possibilities that the Thai economy would outperform the baseline projection  due to  
(1) less -than-expected slowdown of the Chinese economy due to gover nment economic 
stimulus measures; (2) higher -than-expected domestic demand as a result of (2.1) so oner-than-
expected implementation of government infrastructure projects, PPP projects, and private 
investment, (2.2) a quick dissolving of political uncertain ties, and (3) additional government 
measures to support private spending. Meanwhile, risks to the forecasts of headline and core 
inflation were expected to tilt downward  in line with downside risks to growth projections  
(Chart 2. 20 and Chart 2. 21).

Monetary Policy Report March  2019  32 3. Monetary Policy Decision  
The Committee assessed the Thai economy would expand around its potential on the back 
of domestic demand despite somewhat at a slower pace due to a slowdown in external 
demand. Headline inflation was e xpected to rise in line with the previous projection . There 
remained  pockets  of risks in the financial system that might pose vulnerabilities to financial 
stability in the future.  
The Committee weighed various factors in determining the most appropriate co urse of 
monetary policy, placing great emphasis on the strength and continuation of economic growth, 
preserving financial stability, and development of headline inflation. Details on the assessment 
of latest developments and outlook are as follows.  
1. Economi c growth  The Thai economy was expected to expand around its potential, on 
the back of domestic demand, despite somewhat at a slower pace than previously assessed 
due to a slowdown in external demand. Private consumption was expected to continue 
expanding. Both farm and non -farm income continued to improve, while purchasing power of 
low-income households were additionally supported by  government measures.  Private 
investment would continue to expand thanks to the relocation of production base to Thailand, 
and a further investment of the private sector in the public -private partnership (PPP) investment 
projects. Public spending would continue to drive the economy, especially public investment on 
transport infrastructure including the dual -track railway and mass  rapid transit projects  despite 
delays in some projects. However, growth drivers stemming from external demand w ere 
expected to moderate following the slowdown in trading partner economies and global trade 
volume. Merchandise exports would be affected by t he trade protectionist measures between 
the US and China and a down cycle of electronic products. Exports of services would exhibit a 
slower growth due to a lower spending per head as a result of the global economic slowdown, 
despite an increasing number o f foreign tourists. The Committee assessed that the growth 
projection was still subject to downside risks due to (1) lower -than-expected growth of trading 
partner economies  following such as more intensified trade protectionist measures between the 
U.S. an d China, uncertainties regarding Brexit negotiation, the U. S. import tariffs on automobiles 
and parts, and geopolitical risks , and (2) lower -than-expected private investment due to political 
uncertainties.  
2. Preserving financial stability The Committee view ed that there remained certain  
pockets of risks in the financial system that might pose vulnerability to financial stability in the 
future. Such risks included (1) elevated  household debt , especially auto and  personal  loans  
which continued to expand . Meanw hile, credit quality of mortgage and auto -leasing loans would 
deteriorate due in part to loosen  credit standards in the previous period s. Moreover, a prolonged 
low interest rate environment partly induce d household s to create new debt, which could weigh 
on consumption and affect debt -serviceability in the future. (2) The continued search -for-yield 
behavior given a prolonged low interest rate environment could lead to underpricing of 
risks.  For example, saving cooperatives continued to search for higher retu rns as reflected in 
high growth of their assets and deposits, although somewhat decelerated. In addition, large 
corporates would i ncreasingly raise funds  given a  prolonged low interest rate environment, 
reflecting  their high prop ortions in the bond  market and commercial b ank loans.  Nevertheless, 
the business structure of such companies  had become increasingly complex and thus resulted  
Monetary Policy Report March  2019  33 in more complicated risk  assessment and possibly underpricing of risks. (3) There remained 
risks in the real estate sector , including oversupply of condominiums in some  areas and 
increasing role of Chinese demand on Thai condominiums which might decrease given a 
slowdown of the Chinese economy. In addition , there was a need to monitor the adjustments in 
the property market and mortgage loans after the revised macroprudential measures on 
mortgage loans were to be effective in April 2019.  
3. Inflation development Headline inflation was projected to trend up in line with the 
previous assessment owing to upward pressure on energy prices as a result of a tightening 
crude oil supply that offset demand prospects following  the global economic slowdown. Fresh 
food prices would rise on account of an intensified drought. Meanwhile, core inflation was 
expected to decline following a slower pa ce of economic growth. However, demand -pull 
inflationary pressures would gradually rise as reflected in various ind icators including trimmed 
mean and principal component indicators.  (Chart 3.1) Nevertheless, structural changes such as 
intensified price com petition and cost -reduction technology  partly ca used  inflation to rise at a 
slower pace than in the past. Moreover, short -term inflation expectations (1 -year ahead) were 
largely unchanged from the previous quarter. (Chart 3.2)  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The policy rate hi ke had transmitted to money market rates and short -term government 
bond yields, including deposit rates.  
The Committee assessed the monetary policy transmission after the policy rate 
hike in December 2018. The money market rates, short -term government bon d yields, and 
deposit rates of some financial institutions began to rise. The current level of banking liquidity 
was sufficient to support loan growth in the period ahead, while most lending rates were largely 
unchanged. Real interest rates edged up slight ly but still remained at low levels. The private 
sector continued to raise funds, where both corporate  and consumer loans expanded. Moreover, 
the Committee viewed that a slight reduction in the degree of  monetary policy accommodation 
at the previous meetin g would not be an obstacle to economic growth in the period ahead but

Monetary Policy Report March  2019  34 would help reduce risks to financial stability, which would in turn benefit the sustainability of 
economic growth in the long run.  
The Committee voted to keep the policy rate at 1.75 pe rcent. Going forward, a policy rate 
hike would be gradual and follow a data -dependent approach.  
At the meeting on February 6, 2019, the Committee voted 4 to 2 to maintain the 
policy rate at 1.75 percent. Two members voted to raise the policy rate 0.25 per centage 
point from 1.75 to 2.00 percent. One MPC member was unable to attend the meeting. The 
Committee viewed that current accommodative monetary policy stance had contributed to the 
continuation of economic growth and was appropriate given the inflation target. Thus, most 
members decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at this meeting. Nevertheless, two 
members viewed that the economy continued expanding around its potential, and that overall 
financial conditions would remain accommodative and conducive  to economic growth despite 
an additional 0.25 percentage point increase in the policy rate. Hence, they voted to raise the 
policy rate at this meeting to curb financial stability risks and to build up policy space.  
At the meeting on March 20, 2019, the Co mmittee voted unanimously to maintain 
the policy rate at 1.75 percent. The Committee viewed that the current accommodative 
monetary policy stance had contributed to the continuation of economic growth and was 
appropriate given the inflation target. In addi tion, given heightened global and domestic 
uncertainties in the current period, the Committee thus voted to keep the policy rate unchanged 
to assess the clarity of impacts from such uncertainties. Furthermore, there remained a need to 
address risks to fina ncial stability through a combination of policy tools , including an appropriate 
policy rate as well as microprudential and macroprudential measures.  
Looking ahead, the policy rate hike would be gradual and follow a data -dependent 
approach.  The Committee w ould closely monitor developments of economic growth, inflation, 
and financial stability, together with associated risks, in deliberating appropriate monetary policy 
in the period ahead.

Global Economy  
Major advanced economies were expected to expand at a slower rate . The U.S. economy slowed 
down due to a temporary impact from the government shutdown. The euro area and Japanese 
econom ies moderated on account of domestic factors and a slowdown of global trade volume. 
The Chinese economy  decelerated  as a result  of a series of financial stability measures 
implemented in recent periods. Meanwhile, slow ing global trade had a  larger -than-expected 
impact on Asian economies. Looking  ahead, Thailand’s trading partners were projected to expand 
with private consumption and public spending as key drivers.

Monetary Policy Report March  2019  40 Thai Economy  
The Thai economy continued to gain traction. Economic g rowth would be supported by  the 
expansion of  private consumption thanks to a more broad -based improvement in household 
income. Private investment expanded , while public expenditure continued to drive the economy 
through spending on  both consumption and investment. Meanwhile, overall merchandise exports 
slowed down in ta ndem with trading partner economies and given the impact from trade 
protectionist  measures between the U.S. and China. In addition, t he number  of foreign tourists 
picked up , partly due to the exten ded exemption  of visa -on-arrival (VOA) until the end of April 2019 
and new flight routes from China and India.

Monetary Policy Report March  2019  41 Inflation  
Headline inflation declined mainly due to the fall in energy prices. Core inflation decreased due 
to slower improvement in prices  of processed  foods and non -alcoholic beverages, as well as 
house rents. Nevertheless , structural changes , such as rising e-commerce trends and price 
competition , would reduce  upwar d pressures on core inflation in non -food categories in the 
period ahead.

Monetary Policy Report March  2019  42 Financial conditions  
Short -term money market rates and short -term government bond yields gradually rose in line 
with the policy rate. Meanwhile, medium -term and long -term government bond yields fluctuated 
owing to  both domestic and external factors. Private credit extended to both businesses and 
households continued to expand. The baht appreciated against the U.S. dollar  in line with 
movements of regional currencies , following  a more dovish stance of the Fed’s monetary policy 
communications  and less concern of investors  over global econom ic uncertainties . Since the 
end of February 2019, the baht weakened against the U.S. dollar due to geopolitical risks and 
Thailand’s general election.
