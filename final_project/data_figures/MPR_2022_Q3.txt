Executive SummaryGlobal Economy
Trading partners ’ growth is expected to slow to 2.9% in 2022 and 2.6% in 2023. This 
downward revision is due to high inflation , slowing global demand, and tighter -than-expected 
financial conditions as a result of monetary policy normalization by central banks around the 
world. Risks to trading partners’ growth outlook are tilted to the downside due to tightening and 
more volatile global financial conditions, potential slowdown in global trade, and geopolitical 
tensions that could escalate and become prolonged.
The Thai Economy
The Thai economy is expected to continue expanding at 3.3% in 2022 and 3.8% in 
2023 driven mainly by tourism and private consumption. The number of foreign tourists is 
revised up to 9.5 million in 2022 and 21 million in 2023 given higher tourism demand and the 
relaxation of international travel restrictions. The economic recovery has become more broad -
based across business sectors especially in the services sector, and across income groups. This 
is reflected in unemployed and underemployed figures which have been declining to pre -COVID 
levels, as well as the income recovery of workers in the manufacturing and services sectors, and 
among the self -employed. The global economic slowdown has an impact on exports but 
would not derail the overall Thai economic recovery as the recovery is driven mainly by tourism 
and domestic consumption . Foreigners who travel to Thailand recently are mostly from regional 
countries ( excl. China) and have high income. Demand of such tourists are not significantly sensitive 
to prevailing global economic conditions . 
Risks to the growth outlook become balanced. Upside risks include higher -than-expected
foreign tourist figures and private investment, while downside risks include the global economic 
slowdown and policy rate hikes by central banks around the world. Inflation
Headline inflation is expected to average 6.3% in 2022 and 2.6% in 2023. Headline inflation
would decline in tandem with global oil prices and the easing of supply chain disruptions . Core 
inflation is expected to be higher, averaging at 2.6% in 2022 and 2.4% in 2023, mainly due to 
higher cost passthrough. Nonetheless , cost passthrough would be limited going forward as most 
businesses have already passed on some of the higher costs to consumers in recent periods . Wages 
have also increased in some sectors and areas, but there have not been signs of a broad -based wage 
increase. Risks of wage -price spiral in Thailand remain limited because the share of wage earners in 
Thailand is lower than advanced economies, and the Thai labor supply is more elastic than other 
countries . Immigrants and workers that have previously relocated to their hometowns are also 
gradually returning to economic areas. Demand -pull inflationary pressures are limited as the Thai 
economy is still in a recovery phase. Meanwhile, medium -term inflation expectations remain well-
anchored within the target range. 
The above inflation projection has thoroughly considered both upside and downside 
risks, and the baseline projection has already taken into account various factors that could 
cause inflation to remain high for longer to some extent. Notwithstanding, risks to the inflation 
outlook must be monitored closely, especially the risk of higher cost passthrough if businesses face 
rising cost pressures from multiple sources simultaneously such as raw materials , oil prices, and 
wages. This could affect inflation expectations going forward. Nonetheless, inflation could turn out 
lower than the baseline if energy prices decline much more than expected given the impact of global 
economic slowdown on demand . 
6/71Assessment of the Economic and Inflation OutlookExecutive Summary7/71Executive Summary
Financial Conditions and Financial Stability
Overall financial conditions in Thailand remain accommodative. The r eal
interest rate remains negative, and private sector funding costs remain conducive for 
business financing although government bond yields have gradually risen in tandem with the 
policy rate. Short-term government bond yields increased slightly in line with the gradual 
pace of monetary policy normalization , while long-term government bond yields moved in 
line with US Treasury yields. Commercial bank lending rates have gradually increased but 
remain low overall. On exchange rates, the baht against U.S. dollar continued to 
depreciate rapidly due to the U.S. dollar’s strength , and moved in line with regional 
currencies. The MPC will continue to closely monitor developments in the financial and 
exchange rate markets, especially during the period of heigntened volatilities, and assess the 
impact on the overall growth and inflation outlook. However, Thailand’s external stability 
remains strong . External debt remains low , no unusual movements in capital flows have 
been observed, and international reserves remain high. 
Financial stability remains sound overall. Commercial banks’ capital and loan loss 
provision remain high. Debt serviceability of businesses and households has improved in line 
with the economic recovery. However, SMEs in some sectors have yet to fully recover, and 
some low-income households are still sensitive to the rising living costs. Debt -to-GDP ratios 
of households and businesses remain high. The MPC views that an aggressive policy rate hike 
could negatively impact the recovery of those vulnerable groups. Monetary policy should 
thus be normalized in a gradual and measured manner, coupled with having targeted 
measures and sustainable solutions in place for the vulberable groups.  Monetary Policy Decisions in the Third Quarter of 2022
At the meeting on 10 August 2022, the MPC voted 6 to 1 to raise the policy rate 
by 0.25 percentage point from 0.50% to 0.75%. Most members voted to raise the policy 
rate by 0.25 percentage point in favor of a gradual policy rate hike which would facilitate a 
sustained economic recovery without creating upward pressures on inflation in the period 
ahead. One member voted to raise the policy rate by 0.50 percentage point to reduce the risk 
of having to raise the policy rate aggressively in the future , and views that such a rate hike 
would not significantly impact the economic recovery, while helping to build up policy space 
to prepare for any future uncertainty. 
At the meeting on 28 September 2022, the MPC voted unanimously to raise the 
policy rate by 0.25 percentage point from 0.75% to 1.00%. The Thai economic recovery has 
continued to gain traction on the back of tourism and private consumption . Headline inflation 
remains high due to higher cost passthrough in recent periods despite declining commodity 
prices. Overall, the growth and inflation outlook is largely unchanged from the previous 
assessment. Thus, the MPC deems that a gradual policy normalization remains an appropriate 
course for monetary policy.
Under the monetary policy framework with objectives of maintaining price stability, 
supporting sustainable and full -potential economic growth, and preserving financial stability, 
the MPC assesses that the Thai economy will continue to recover but with increased inflation 
risks mainly from supply -side factors, and that SMEs in sectors that have yet to fully recover
and low-income households are still vulnerable. The MPC judges that the policy rate should 
be normalized in a gradual and measured manner to a level that is consistent with 
sustainable growth in the long term. The MPC is ready to adjust the size and timing of 
policy normalization should the growth and inflation outlook shifts from the current 
assessment.≡

Inflation is rising in many countries.
Elevated inflation prompted 
many central banks to pursue 
aggressive policy rate hikes.  Global Economy: Key Issues
Global economy is expected to slow 
down in the period ahead
due to the impact of inflation on 
growth among advanced economies , 
and economic slowdown in China. Risks to trading partners’ growth 
aretilted to the downside
from tighter and more volatile 
global financial conditions , 
global trade slowdown, 
and geopolitical tensions. 
9/71Global Economy
Consumption and manufacturing sector are expected to slow down as elevated inflation has weighed on global demand , whereas 
global supply disruptions have continued to ease. Looking ahead , consumption and manufacturing sector will still be weighed 
down by high inflation and monetary policy tightening which will impact consumer purchasing power and production costs , as 
well as weaken confidence as a result of greater uncertainties.  
Consumption is affected mainly by higher living costs resulting from high inflation . The retail sales index in July is largely unchanged from the previous month for G3 
and Asian countries , but declines for China following the new COVID -19 outbreak in many cities . Manufacturing sector began to slow down in tandem with global 
demand . This is reflected in declining Global Manufacturing PMI despite the gradual easing of global supply disruptions as reflected in shorter delivery time and 
falling freight costs. Going forward, consumption and manufacturing sector would likely continue to decline given the rising inflation outlook which will affect 
household and business confidence. 10/71Retail Sales Index Global Manufacturing Purchasing Manager Index: PMI

The Chinese economy has slowed down. Declining global demand has impacted China’s manufacturing and exports. 
Domestic demand in China has also been affected by containment measures which have been in place in many cities 
and prolonged problems in the real estate sector.  
China’s manufacturing and exports would grow at a slower pace owing to global economic slowdown and weaker domestic demand given the 
continuation of the government’s Zero -COVID policy which limited people’s mobility in many cities. Such policy is a major factor that weigh on 
consumption and consumer confidence . China’s real estate sector also remains stagnant as buyers are concerned about developers ’ ability to 
complete their projects and deliver the homes they have sold. While the Chinese government has deployed stimulus and assistance measures, 
problems in the real estate sector are likely to persist and affect investment confidence among households and businesses going forward. 11/71Property Sales in China China’s Manufacturing Purchasing Manager Index: PMI

pressures due to Russia’s natural gas cut -off. In Asia , rising inflation has been mainly affecting net energy importing countries. Inflation in some Asian 
economies remains relatively low due partly to government measures including energy price and cost -of-living subsidies. Looking ahead, supply -side

The Thai Economy would

The economic outturns in Q2/2022 are weaker than expected but are offset by higher -than-expected foreign tourist 
arrivals. Thus, the growth forecast for 2022 is largely unchanged. Meanwhile, growth forecast for 2023 is revised down as

•Tourism recovered markedly after the removal of Thailand Pass. This is 
consistent with foreign tourist figures in Q3/2022 which would be higher than 
previously assessed.
•Foreign tourist figure projections for 2022 and 2023 are revised up on 
account of higher -than-expected outturns in foreign tourist arrivals and growing 
tourism demand, especially among short -haul tourists (exclu. Chinese tourists ). 
China would likely permit its citizen to travel abroad in the latter half of 2023, 
and Chinese tourists would resume their travel to Thailand in Q4/2023 which 
is later than previously assessed. 2022 2023

in 2022 than previously assessed , especially spending in tourism -
related services, despite some slowdown in the second half of the 
year as pent -up demand wanes. 
•High-income households still have the capacity to spend in the 
period ahead astheir incomes are unaffected by the COVID -19 
outbreak and their savings are high . 
•However, high living costs would weigh on household consumption,
especially for low -income households despite government measures
that somewhat help support their purchasing power. 
•Private consumption is expected to continue expanding in 2023 
at a rate close to the previous assessment as employment and 
household income are gradually improving in tandem with the 
economic conditions.

2023 1.1 (2.1) 0.1 (0.2) 1.0 (1.9)Merchandise exports forecast
Note: ( ) Jun 2022 forecastThe value of merchandise exports in 2022 is revised up on account of higher -than-expected 
outturns in the second quarter. This is driven by both higher export prices due to rising global 
commodity prices such as oil , agricultural products, food, steel, and chemicals, as well as by larger 
quantity , especially exports of agricultural products to China and exports of food to Europe . Export 
growth in the latter half of 2022 is expected to be weaker than previously expected both in 
terms of prices and quantity due to (1 ) falling demand from trading partners especially  the U.S., 
Japan, and China, (2) lower agricultural outputs following the end of harvest season, and 
(3) declining export prices in tandem with energy and commodity prices.
The value of merchandise exports in 2023 is revised down from lower export quantity mainly
due to the economic slowdown among trading partners . Export prices are projected to be largely 
unchanged from the previous assessment. 
Risks to the export outlook include (1) global economic slowdown and problems in China’s real 
estate sector which could result in slowing exports of some goods such as iron and chemicals and 
(2) potentially larger -than-expected decline in commodity prices.

Factors that could result in growth outperforming the baseline
• Foreign tourist arrivals could rebound more than expected following the relaxation 
of international travel restrictions and rising demand for Thailand tourism.
• Private investment could be higher than expected on the back of projects that are 
awaiting approval to commence construction as reflected in rising number of areas 
seeking for construction permits. In addition, some public private partnership (PPP) 
projects are ready to operate and could commence sooner than expected. 
Factors that could result in growth under performing the baseline
• Growth slowdown among trading partners and policy rate hikes by various central 
banks could have a larger impact on global economic recovery than expected, 
especially for advanced economies, which would in turn affect Thai exports and 
investment going forward. 
• Global supply disruption scould last longer than expected. This could impede the 
recovery in the manufacturing sector to a point that income and private consumption 
would also be affected. Probabilities that GDP growth could outperform or underperform the baseline projection are largely equal. Upside risks 
include foreign tourist arrivals and private investment which could be higher than expected, while downside risks 
include global economic slowdown and policy rate hikes by central banks around the world.

Box 1: Implications of labor shortages and minimum wage increase for inflation
Tourism and economic recovery over the recent periods resulted in a 
continued improvement in labor demand and labor market conditions since 
Q4/2021. This is reflected in quantitative indicators of labor market conditions 
including rising employment and working hours, as well as wage indicators. Such 
increases were partly due to tight labor market conditions in certain sectors 
that are facing labor shortages. About 3 million of Thai and migrant workers 
have relocated to their hometown since the COVID -19 outbreak. Most of them 
have yet to return to economic areas. Among those, some Thai workers may 
have become self -employed as reflected in the number of insured workers under 
Section 33 of the Social Security Act which remained well below the pre -COVID 
levels, especially in hotel, restaurant, construction, textile, and retail sale sectors 
(Chart 1 ).Improving economic activities in those sectors prompted employers to 
gradually raise wages to attract enough workers so that businesses could keep up 
with increasing demand. Against this backdrop , the hourly wage growth (%YoY) 
in the private sector has increased from 2.4% in Q1/2022 to 3.8% in Q2/2022.

Looking ahead, wages could risefurther duetolabor shortages andthe
minimum wage increase that would take effect inOctober 2022 across all77
provinces whereby theminimum wage would increase byanaverage of5%from 321
baht/day to337baht/day .However ,overall wages maynotincrease thatmuch
because
•Thelabor shortages areeasing .There aresigns that Thai workers1are
returning toeconomic areas, while thenumber ofmigrant workers under
theMOU hasbeen increasing especially after Thailand opened itsborders
andrelaxed entry requirements formigrant workers inJune 2022.Thishelped
easelabor market conditions insome sectors andprevent wages fromaccelerating
beyond current levels .
•Theminimum wage increase would have limited impact onoverall wages .
Theaverage wage isexpected toincrease byonly 2.3%2,mainly from an
indirect effect fromemployers’ adjustment ofthewage structure forallworkers
including those whoarereceiving wages above thenewminimum wage.The
overall impact isexpected tobesmall aswage increase forsuch agroup will
besmaller compared totheincrease applied toworkers who arereceiving
wages close tothenewminimum wage.Thedirect effect isalsoexpected
belimited asmost workers arereceiving wages above thenewminimum wage.Currently, there are only 2.1 million workers (about 15% of total private, 
non-farm workers) receiving wages below the new minimum wage3. Most of 
them are in construction, commerce , personalized services, restaurants, and food 
manufacturing sectors (Chart 2),and are working in small businesses where the 
employers may have limited capacity to raise wages. Notwithstanding, the 
minimum wage increase would help retain and attract migrant workers , and thus 
help ease labor shortages because about half of migrant workers are receiving 
wages below the new minimum wage. 
The impact of the minimum wage increase on workers will vary across areas. 
In key economic areas such as Bangkok and vicinity where the wage increase is largest 
at 6.65%, more than 90% of workers are already paid above the minimum wage. On 
the contrary, workers in border or agricultural areas such as Pattani, Narathiwat, and 
Chaiyaphum would benefit more because of the higher proportion of workers who are 
paid below the minimum wage compared to key economic areas.

Box 1: Implications of labor shortages and minimum wage increases for inflation
Thepassthrough ofhigher wages toinflation isassessed tobelimited, andthelikelihood ofa
wage-price spiral isconsidered low.Thisisbecause (1)most Thai workers arefarmers andself-
employed whose incomes arefrom sales ofgoods andservices ,notwages .Non-farm workers who
arereceiving wages account foronly 44%oftotal workers4,which issignificantly lower than inother
countries5,(2)theshare oflabor costs tototal production costs ofbusinesses isgenerally low,
averaging atabout 15%,and(3)businesses areunable tofullypassonthehigher costs toconsumers
because demand hasyettofullyrecover .Some firms maynotraise prices further asthey have already
done sotocover thehigher costs ofrawmaterials which arealarge partoftheirtotal production costs6.
In summary , although labor shortages in certain sectors and the minimum wage increase 
could create upward pressures on wages, the easing labor shortages would help limit the increase 
in wages going forward. The passthrough of higher wages to inflation and the likelihood of a wage -price 
spiral remain limited due to small share of non -farm workers in the Thai labor market , low share of labor 
costs to total production costs, and limited cost passthrough to consumer prices.

from higher costpassthrough .
Supply -side inflationary pressures would decline gradually
•Global commodity prices have mostly declined as supply chain disruptions are easing, 
except for natural gas. 
•Looking ahead, domestic retail oil prices are expected to fall as global crude oil 
prices decline due to slower -than-expected global economic growth and higher -than-
expected oil supply from Russia. Both factors have helped ease oil market tightness. 
In the short term , domestic oil prices would likely fall as the government has extended 
the excise tax cut for diesel by 5 baht /litre from Sep 2022 until Nov 2022.
•Electricity costs are expected to increase gradually because of the two reasons.
1.High natural gas prices in the global market would have a little impact on 
electricity costs. Imported LNG accounts for only 11% of total fuel sources used in 
electricity generation*, about half of which is acquired through long -term contracts.
2.Electricity cost subsidies whereby the fuel tariff (Ft) is reduced for households using 
less than 500 kWh/ month during Sep-Dec 2022

Cost passthrough could be limited in the period ahead as supply -side pressures would likely dissipate and most businesses have already 
passed on some of the costs to consumers. However , there remains a need to monitor cost passthrough if businesses face rising cost 
pressures from multiple sources simultaneously. 
At present, cost pressures are declining
•Producer price index (PPI) has declined mainly due to prices of 
petroleum products and other industrial goods.
•Consumer price index (CPI) has increased partly as businesses have 
already passed on some of the costs to consumers. However , there 
remains a need to monitor cost pressures, which are reflected in 
the high PPI/CPI ratio. 
32/71In the next 3 months ,most businesses will not raise prices
or will do so by no more than 5% of current prices.

•Trading partners’ growth is revised down throughout the forecast horizon due to monetary 
policy tightening to tame high inflation and China’s slowing demand caused by the Zero -
COVID policy and problems in the real estate sector. In addition, the prolonged Russia -
Ukraine conflict continues to impact the euro area economy .  
•The Federal Funds Rate would be raised more aggressively mainly because of inflationary 
pressure that turn out higher and more persistent than expected. 
•Regional currencies (excluding the Chinese Yuan) would depreciate throughout the 
forecast horizon as the Fed has signalled a more aggressive policy rate hike. 
•Dubai crude oil prices would be lower throughout the forecast horizon due to the global 
economic slowdown. 
•Farm income (excluding government support measures ) is revised up due to higher -than-
expected outputs of many crops as well as high prices especially cassava, which is in high 
demand for animal feed and alternative energy productions during the period of high oil 
prices. Higher input costs partly contribute to price increases in some products such as pig, 
andcause the net profit to decline. Thus, purchasing power of farmers remains fragile. 
•Public spending at current prices is revised down mainly on account of lower SOE investment
budget in the FY2023. Government consumption spending is revised up from higher -than-
expected medical expenses related to COVID -19.

Short-term government bond yields have been largely stable in line with the BOT communication that monetary policy will be normalized in a gradual and 
measured manner. Long-term government bond yields have increased in tandem with USTreasury yields as a result of monetary policy tightening by major 
central banks to curb inflation. Credit spreads for bonds with less than 3 years to maturity are largely unchanged overall. Credit spread for bonds with BBB credit 
rating declined somewhat but remain at a high level. On the whole , higher funding costs faced by the private sector have yet to affect financing activities. 
Businesses have gradually obtained financing in the prior period and are likely to continue seeking more financing as the economic recovery gains traction. 
Thai businesses operating abroad are also likely to rely more on domestic financing as financing costs in foreign countries are rising.  Government bond yields have increased but funding costs overall remain conducive for private sector financing.

rate: MLR ,minimum overdraft rate: MOR, and minimum retail rate: MRR ) were increased by 0.25 -0.40%. Looking ahead, commercial bank deposit and lending rates 
would be gradually raised in line with expectation of the policy rate path , the economic recovery, and the end of the FIDF fee reduction scheme at end-20221/

as well as preserve macroeconomic and financial stability in response to the COVID -19pandemic . Commercial bank interest rates remain low but are expected to gradually increase in line with expectation of the policy rate path .

Monetary Policy Decision: Summary of Key Considerations
Monetary Policy Decision
The MPC will pursue a gradual 
and measured monetary policy 
normalization, andis ready to 
adjust the size and timing of 
policy normalization should the 
growth and inflation outlook 
shifts from the current 
assessment. Financial Stability
The financial system remains 
resilient overall. Debt 
serviceability of businesses and 
households has improved 
in line with the economic 
recovery although some 
borrowers remain vulnerable. Economic growth
The Thai economy is expected 
to continue expanding driven 
mainly b y tourism and domestic 
demand. The global economic 
slowdown would not derail the 
overall Thai economic recovery.  Inflation
Headline inflation is expected to 
return to the target range in 
2023 owing to declining energy 
prices and easing supply chain 
disruptions . 
46/71Monetary Policy Decision
Economic growth: Thailand’s GDP is expected to return to the pre-COVID level around the end of 2022 or the beginning 
of 2023, mainly driven by recovery in tourism and domestic demand. The economy will grow at its potential in Q1/2024. Economic growth Inflation Financial Stability

Box 2: Monetary policy transmission and its impact on households and businesses
57/71The policy rate in Thailand has been gradually raised to 1.00% on 28 
September 2022 after being held at 0.50% since 20 May 2020. The Monetary 
Policy Committee (MPC) views that extraordinarily accommodative monetary 
policy has become less needed given the changing balance of risks. Theeconomy 
has continued to recover while inflation rose on the back of energy prices and 
remains elevated for many months . Such increased inflation risks could weigh on
the economic recovery going forward. In this regard, monetary policy normalization 
must therefore begin in order to achieve the objectives of supporting economic 
growth, preserving price stability, and safeguarding financial stability. Nonetheless, 
the MPC views that policy rate should be raised in a gradual and measured manner 
to ensure that financing costs do not increase too rapidly and allow stakeholders to 
make needed adjustments. 
The impact of monetary policy normalization on financing costs faced 
by households and businesses in Thailand will mainly depend on policy 
transmission through interest rate channel as financial institutions’ lending 
accounts 89 % of total private credit (Chart 1, LHS). In general, when the MPC 
raises the policy rate , interest rates in the money market will increase and financial 
institutions will adjust their asset -liability management to maintain profitability by 
raising both lending and deposit rates to the appropriate levels. Chart 1:Share of Thailand’s private credit outstanding

2/ Assessment of the policy transmission 1 quarter after the policy rate is adjusted. 
58/71Box 2: Monetary policy transmission and its impact on households and businesses
Main creditors in the Thai financial system are commercial banks and specialized 
financial institutions (SFIs), which account for 53% and 17% of total loan outstanding 
in the financial system, respectively (Chart 1, RHS). New lending is generally 
extended by commercial banks and SFIs1/. Therefore, increases in lending rates by 
commercial banks and SFIs would result in higher financing costs for new borrowers 
as well as higher interest burden for existing borrowers with floating -rate loans.
A study on how commercial banks adjust their interest rates in the recent 
periods found that the degree of monetary policy transmission differs across 
interest rate types and the timing of rate adjustment also varies across banks . 
Overall , banks transmit about 40 -60% of the policy rate change to all lending 
rates2/. During a tightening cycle , banks would transmit changes in the policy rate to 
lending rates more than they would during an easing cycle. The study also found that 
the interest rate type that sees the biggest passthrough is the fixed -deposit rate, 
followed by several lending rates (MLR, MRR, and MOR ), with the smallest passthrough
to saving rate (Chart 2 ). Each bank’s size of adjustment for deposit and lending rates 
of different products also varies, depending on shares of deposit and loan outstandings
of each product type as well as asset -liability management strategy of each bank.   Chart 2: Passthrough of policy rate to

59/71Box 2: Monetary policy transmission and its impact on households and businesses
Timing of rate adjustment varies across banks. During past tightening 
cycles in Thailand (Aug 2004 –Jun 2006 and Jun 2010 –Aug 2011), it takes 
about 30 days on average after the policy rate hike for all banks to adjust their 
MLRs. The sizes of rate adjustment also differ during both cycles (Chart 3).
Nonetheless, the first few policy rate hikes would have a limited 
impact on households and businesses . The magnitude of impact will 
depend on whether the loan is fixed or floating rate . For consumer loans , 
an immediate increase in interest burden will be limited to non-installment 
loans such as retail loans for business purpose and margin loans (19% of 
consumer loan outstanding ). Meanwhile, consumer loans that would not 
see an increase in interest burden yet are fixed-rate and floating -rate 
loans with fixed installments, which together make up about 60% of 
consumer loan outstanding (Chart 4). Fixed-rate loans will be unaffected. 
For floating -rate loans with fixed installments , banks usually calculate and set 
the installments that cover potential increases in interest rates to a certain 
extent. Therefore, the installment amounts would not increase unless the 
increase in interest rates is larger than what banks have expected . Chart 3: Transmission of policy rate hike to minimum loan rate (MLR)

installment include mortgage, home -for-cash, and education loans. (3) Floating rate loans with no installment include retail 
loan for business purpose (exclu. nano finance ) and margin loan. (4) Unclassified loans include other personal loan (exclu. 
personal loan under BOT supervision,  home -for-cash, and car -for-cash)and other loans.Monetary Policy Decision
60/71Box 2: Monetary policy transmission and its impact on households and businesses
Forcorporate loans , businesses with floating -rate loans would be 
affected immediately. The floating -rate loans make up 58% of total SME 
loan outstanding and 48% of large corporate loan outstanding (Chart 5) . 
However, financing cost is a marginal portion , only 2 -4%,of total costs 
faced by businesses (Chart 6) and so the increase in financing costs 
would not have a significant impact on businesses. The Thai Bankers’ 
Association (TBA) held a press conference on 10 August 2022 and stated that 
Thai banks recognize the impact of interest rate increase on borrowers 
especially vulnerable groups who have been affected by the COVID -19 and 
the increased living costs in recent periods. The banks would thus gradually 
raise interest rates, starting from interest rates that are applied to large 
borrowers who possess higher degree of flexibility to absorb the shock. 
Assistance measures will also be kept in place for vulnerable borrowers to 
support the economic recovery and prevent NPLs from rising to a point that 
can pose risks to financial stabilit y. 42%52%

61/71Box 2: Monetary policy transmission and its impact on households and businesses
The Bank of Thailand (BOT ) emphasizes the importance of targeted 
financial measures which should be in place to help mitigate the impact on 
vulnerable groups in a targeted manner , especially SMEs and households 
whose incomes have yet to fully recover. Such measures include both existing 
and new ones. Existing financial measures can be grouped into 3 categories: (1) 
measures that address exising debt include the long -term debt relief measures 
with an objective to actively pursue debt restructuring so that borrowers’ 
repayment plan is in line with their income flows, as well as measures to support 
debt refinancing and debt consolidation , (2) liquidity support measures include 
the special loan facility, and (3) additional measures include “Debt Exit Fastlane”
and “Debt Doctor” schemes to provide support for the wider population . The 
BOT also announced additional measures targeted at vulnerable retail borrowers . 
Measures for borrowers with normal -status loans are, for example, reducing the 
minimum credit card repayment rate to 5% until 2023, and extending the 
repayment period for digital personal loans to 12 months until 2023. Measures for 
borrowers with non -performing loans include adjusting repayment conditions 
under “Debt Clinic” scheme and organizing a “ Debt Mediation” event between 
September 2022 –January 2023. In addition, the BOT has introduced a transformationloan facility under the Soft Loan Emergency Decree to help enhance 
cheap -funding access for SMEs who have survived the COVID -19 pandemic 
to improve, develop, and strengthen their business capabilities through the 
adoption of digital technology, green business practices, or investment in 
innovation. The facility offers a credit line of 150 million baht to each 
borrower with the average interest rate over the first 5 years of no more 
than 5%. The transformation loan facility will be available untilApril 2023 
as with the existing special loan facility (Chart 7) .Monetary Policy Decision
