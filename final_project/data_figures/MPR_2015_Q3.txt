The Monetary Policy Report  is prepared quarterly by staff of the 
Bank of Thailand with the approval of the Monetary Policy Committee 
(MPC).  It serves two purposes: ( 1) to communicate to the public the  
MPC’s  consideration and rationales for the conduct of monetary policy, 
and (2)  to present the latest set of  economic and inflation forecast s, based 
on which  the monetary policy decisions  were made .

Monetary Policy Report  September  2015 
Monetary Policy in Thailand  
The Monetary Policy Committee  
Under the Bank of Thailand Act, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) comprise s the 
Governor and two deputy Governors, as well as four distinguished external members  
representing various sectors of the country, with the aim of ensuring  that monetary policy 
decisions are effective and transparent.  
The Monetary Policy Objective  
The MPC sets monetary policy to promote  the objective of supporting sustainable a nd full 
potential economic growth, without causing inflationary problems or economic and financial 
imbalances or bubbles.  
The Monetary Policy Target  
The Cabinet  approved the annual average headline inflation target of 2.5 + 1.5 percent as the 
monetary policy target for 2015, in place of the quarterly average core inflation target of 0.5 – 3.0 
percent . The new inflation target  was jointly proposed by the MPC and the Minister of 
Finance. In the event that headline inflation de viates from the target, the MPC shall explain 
the reasons behind the target breach  to the public, together with measures taken and 
estimated time  to bring inflation back to the target.  
The Monetary Policy Instrument  
The MPC utilizes the 1 -day bilateral repurchase transaction rate as the policy interest rate to 
signal the monetary policy stance.  
Evaluati on of Economic Conditions and Forecasts  
The Bank of Thailand takes into account  information from all sources, the ma croeconomic 
model, data from each economic sector, as well as surveys  of large enterprises , together with  
small and medium -sized  enterprises from all over the country,  and various financial institutions  
to ensure that economic evaluations and forecasts are accurate and cover all aspects, both at 
the macro and micro levels.   
Monetary Policy Communication  
Recognizing the importance of monetary policy communication to the public, the MPC 
employs  various  channel s of communication, both in Thai and English, such as (1) organizing 
a press statement at 14.00 on the day of the Committee meeting, (2) publishing edited 
minutes of the MPC meeting two weeks after the meeting, and (3) publishing the Monetary 
Policy Report  every quarter.  Monetary Policy Report  September  2015

 The Thai economy is projected to expand by less than the previous 
assessment on the back of larger -than-expected  exports contraction amidst a 
slowdown in trading partners’ economies. Subdued farm prices and adverse 
impacts of drought dampened household confid ence and spending, weakening 
the pace of economic recovery. Weak overall economic activities undermined 
private confidence and caused delays in private investment. Nevertheless, public 
spending and sustained tourism growth provided some support for the eco nomy. 
The incident  in Bangkok is, however, expected to reduce the number of foreign 
tourists in the near term.  
Inflationary pressures fell mainly because of supply -side factors. Headline 
inflation is expected to remain negative throughout 2015, but it is l ikely to turn 
positive in the first quarter of 2016 as the effects of high base oil price in 2014 
begin to wane. Core inflation declined slightly but is projected to remain positive 
throughout the forecast period.  
The MPC maintained the policy rate at the August and September 2015 
meetings, giving due weight to maintaining  financial market stability amidst heightened  
volatility. Overall monetary conditions remained accommodative, while  higher 
economic downside risks had already been, in part, taken into con sideration, 
resulting in policy rate reductions during the first half of this year. Going forward, 
the MPC believes that monetary policy stance should remain accommodative to 
support economic recovery, and should help buoy market confidence as market 
senti ments remain sensitive to developments  in the global financial markets .  
In addition, the MPC placed emphasis on evaluating the effectiveness of monetary  
policy transmission to the real economy, and continues to monitor the risk of a 
build -up of financial imbalances as a result of a prolonged low interest rate 
environment.  Monetary Policy Report  September  2015                                                         2 1.1 Growth and inflation prospects  
The Thai economy is likely to recover at 
a slower pace than  assessed in the previous 
issue of Monetary Policy Report. Slow down in 
trading partners’ eco nomies, especially China and 
Asia,  dented orders for Thai exports. Oil-related 
prices, such as petroleum products,  declined  in 
tandem  with oil prices, causing exports contraction 
to be worse  than formerly assessed. Mid-year 
drought affected farm output s, particularly  in-
season rice. The incident  in Bangkok caused a fall 
in the number of foreign tourists in the near term.  
Weaker exports and drought impacts 
weighed down income s and dented confidence 
amongst  the household  sector , caus ing them to be 
more cautio us with spending . These meant that  
lower oil prices could not  boost household 
consumption  as effectively . Moreover, weak  
domestic and external demand s prompt ed the 
business sector  to postpone investment  plans , 
particularly in machinery and equipment for 
production capacity  expansion , although some 
private investments, with links to government 
projects, have been made . 
Public spending exceeded the previous 
projection and provided support to the economy, 
especially with contracts being expedited  for 
governme nt investment projects . The new Cabinet’s 
economic stimulus  also focused on boosting  
investment and employment . 
Nevertheless, higher public spending has 
been unable to counter  the impacts of weaker 
exports and private spending. The MPC thus 
revise s down the GDP  growth forecast s to 2.7 Monetary Policy Report  September  2015                                                         3 percent in 2015 and 3.7 percent in 2016 (see 
Table 1.1) . 
Inflationary pressure s turned out to be 
lower than  the assessment in the last Monetary  
Policy Report, due mainly to the supply -side 
factors. The Committee hence revise d down 
headline and core inflation forecasts throughout  
the projection  period. Headline inflation forecast 
moderated  due to cost factors, namely falling 
global crude oil prices.  Meanwhile, raw food prices 
also remained low. Therefore, the MPC expect ed 
head line inflation to remain negative for an extended 
period, before gradually edging  up and turning 
positi ve in 2016 Q1 when  the effects of high base 
oil price in 2014 disappear . Production costs 
declined in line with oil prices, and demand -side 
pressure s fell. This reflects the slower closing  of 
output gap , consisten t with weaker -than-projected 
economic recovery.  Core inflation is thus projected  
to decline  in 2016 (Table 1.1 and Chart 1.1) . 
However, the Committee assesse d deflation ary 
risks to be low, as the negative headline inflation 
was primarily caused by supply -side factors, 
especially plunging oil prices.  Meanwhile, c ore 
inflation remains positive throughout the forecast 
period, while inflation expectations remained  close  
to the inflation target.  
The MP C revised down t he projections 
for the headline inflation and core inflation -0.9 
and 1.0 percent in 2015 and 1.2 and 0.8 in 2016, 
respectively.  
The Committee factored the following 
developments  into the growth and inflation 
forecasts.  
(1) Trading partners ’ economies are set 
to expand  at a slower rate than previously

China and Asia  (Table 1.2) . 
The Chinese economy is assessed to grow  
at a lower rate than the previous projection, 
resulting in lower  growth  in other Asi an econo mies. 
Given that China is a major importer of commodities  
and electronic  goods , the Chinese slowdown 
lowered  prices of  commodities , especially  agricultural  
raw materials  and metals , and  prices of electronics . 
Furthermore , given close  linkages betw een China  
and other Asian economies , the Chinese slowdown 
and the renminbi  devaluation  caused Asian 
currencies to weaken  (Box 1: Impacts of  the 
Chinese Economic Slowdown and the r enminbi 
Devaluation  on Thai Exports ). 
The slowdown in the Chinese and Asian 
economies caused a slowdown in Thai exports, 
especially exports of final products to China. 
However, Thai exports of intermediate goods to  
China benefited  somewhat from stronger Chinese 
exports  boosted  by the weaker renminbi . Although 
some Thai exports are classified to be in the same 
categories as Chinese exports, the r enminbi 
devaluation  is likely to  have limited impacts on  
Thai exports to other countries. This is because , 
upon closer examination, Thailand and China 
export different types of goods, even if  they are 
listed to be under  the same category, and do not 
compete for the same markets.  
Weaker baht vis -à-vis the U.S. dollar  had 
provided  limited boost  to orders for Thai exports , 
due to sluggish economic conditions in major 
export destinations and depre ciation of the  
currencies  of other export competitors . The weaker  
baht also led to  lower price s in certain export 
products as a result of price negotiation, especially

bargaining power.  
Moreover, volatility  in the global financial 
market  rose in 2015 Q3,  in part as a result of  
weaker -than-expected Chinese growth, fragile 
global economic recovery as well as  low inflationary  
pressure s in the U.S.  in line with  stronger dollar 
and falling  commodity prices.  Thus,  the MPC  
were of the view that, despite  recent positive 
developments in the U.S., the Fed is likely to  
postpone policy rate increase  until late -2015, 
instead of in  2015 Q3 as previously anticipated ,  
in order to ensure steady recovery of the U.S. 
economy  going forward.   
Exports of services are likely to register 
steady growth with the potential to expand at a 
faster pace than previously assessed. Based on 
the upward trend of the number of foreign tourists 
prior to the bomb incident in Bangkok, the 
assumption  on the number of foreign tourists in 
2015 was raised from  28.8 to 29.4 million people.  
Although the incident may have affected confidence  
of some tourists, the MPC judged that this setback 
would only be short -lived and expect ed those  who 
had cancelled th eir trips to Thailand  to return 
provided that there is no further negative incident. 
Under this baseline projection of improvement in 
overall atmosphere and tourists’ confidence, 
exports of services are thus projected to continue  
the expan sion trend  in 2016. 
The further contraction of e xports of goods  
adversely affected  employment and income of 
households in  manufacturing industry for  exports.  
The declining  export  prices , especially rubber,  
weighed down income s for farm households and 
resulted in  more cauti ous household spending  
behavior , hindering economic recovery.  This in Monetary Policy Report  September  2015                                                         6 turn d ented  private sector confidence and caused 
postponements  in private investment,  especially in 
machinery and equipment for  capacity expansion.  
The Committee assesse d that there is 
downside risk for trading partners’ economies to 
expand at a slower pace than the base line 
assumptions , due to weaker -than-projected 
Chinese growth  as well as the adverse impacts of 
the Chinese slowdown and the renminbi 
devaluation  on Asian economies.  Furthermore, the 
Committee deems important to monitor the 
progress of economic and fiscal reforms in 
Greece , which continues to be hindered by  
country’s weak economic fundamentals , as well as  
its long-term implications for the euro area.  
(2) The public secto r continue d to 
provide  support to the economy through 
government spending, especially  in public 
investment.  
The MPC revi sed up wards the assumptions 
on public spending . Central government spending 
increased as  the government expedited the signing 
of contrac ts for  public investment  in 2015 Q3. 
Disbursement s of extra-budgetary spending  under 
the second phase of the fiscal stimulus  were also 
processed  faster than expected.  Furthermore , 
additional investment projects  were scheduled  
to commence in late -2015 , name ly motorway 
construction and phase  III fiscal stimulus1/ (Chart 
1.2). State enterprise investment was also boosted

standards at sub -district level, (2) measures to

at village level in the form of financial  assistance to

Generating Authority of Thailand and the Provincial 
Electricity Authority.  Nonetheless, s ome projects 
faced  delayed, such as the Green Line Mass Rapid 
Transit Project ( MRT ). 
Looking ahead, the MPC  agree d that 
sustained public spending should continue to  
underpin private sector confidence and boost  private 
investment by firms involved with govern ment 
projects, such as  investment under the public -private 
partnership  scheme for selected MRT projects . 
Moreover, the measure aiming at providing financial 
support at the village  level under phase III  fiscal 
stimulus  should provide additional  boost to sma ll-
scale investment and household consumption  in the 
rural area.  
The Committee assesse d the upside risk of 
public spending being greater  than the baseline 
assumption  to be close  to the downside risk of public 
spending being below  it. The  key upside risk factor is 
that the government may be able to accelerate 
spending of phase II and III  stimulus measures  
faster than expected  disbursement  rate. The 
downside risk  is that the new procurement system 
could cause delays in some disbursement s of  
funds.  
(3) Droug ht resulting from unusually 
low level s of rain fall during  mid-2015  (Chart 1.3 ).  
Unusually low amount of rain fall in mid -2015  
combined with drought s that had lasted  from the 
previou s year  led to water shortage  for farming .  
The problem was particularly seve re for in -season 
rice cultivation, which is mainly dependent on 
rainwater, causing a decline in in-season rice 
production  in 2015.  However, some farmers could 
resume  cultivation , following the seasonal return of 
rainfalls  in August 2015. Ric e harvest s were thus

in-season rice production  in 2016 . The increase in 
in-season rice production next year should also 
compensate  for the  likely  decline in off -season rice 
production  stemming  from low water levels in dams  
following  this year’s drought .  
Drought and depressed farm prices reduc ed 
farm income, inducing some workers to migrate  to 
seek jobs in  non-farm sector s. However, most of 
them moved to jobs in the services  sector , which  
offer relatively low er hourly wages  and short er 
working hours, including  jobs in  trading and 
construction  sector . As a result, it led to a fall in 
average income  level in the non -farm sector.  
(Charts 1.4 and  1.5). 
As for the impacts of drought on the price of 
rice, t he decline  in in-season rice production  in 2015 
did not lead to a significant increase in the pr ice of 
Thai rice, owing to sizeable  government stocks of 
rice and sluggish world demand.  
Overall, drought reduced farm income s and 
increased financial vulnerability of farm households . 
This group of households has already suffer ed from 
weak financial position because of their larger debt 
burden relative to other groups  (Chart 1.6) . Hence, 
farm households a re likely to exercise greater 
restraint in their spen ding in the latter half of 2 015, 
likely resulting in the slowing of household spending  
growth . 
(4) Global oil prices declined  by greater 
amounts than expected in 2015 Q3  (Chart 1.7) . 
The MPC revised downward s the baseline 
assumption s for crude oil price  throughout the 
forecast perio d, averaging 52.8 and 51.3 US dollar 
per barrel in 2015 and 2016 , respectively.  The 
revision followed the substantial  decrease in oil

supply  following  increased oil  production in the U.S., 
where some prod ucers had resumed their 
operations, as well as high levels of production by 
OPEC members.  Going forward,  the lifting of 
sanctions on Iran should  further increase global oil 
supply, while demand for oil continues to remain 
subdued  due to fragile global reco very and the 
Chinese slowdown.  
Declining global oil prices translated into 
falling domestic retail oil prices, lowering production 
and transport costs for the business sector . This led 
to a more prolonged period of negative headline  
inflation than previo usly assessed.  Headline  inflation 
is projected  to turn positive in 2016 Q1 , on the 
assumption of a gradual rise in global oil prices and 
the disappearance  of high base oil price effects.  
The decline in oil prices had not provide d a 
significant boost to pri vate consumption and 
investment  because of other negative factors . 
Household income remain ed subdued due to  
depressed  farm prices and drought effects.  
Meanwhile,  household debt remain ed at high levels , 
discouraging household spending. The business 
sector  had little need to invest because of  
considerable  excess production capacity and weak -
demand s from both domestic and foreign markets.  
Moreover,  lower oil prices weighed down on 
the prices of commodity  exports , causing a fall in the 
value of Thai exports an d denting Thai exporters’ 
income . Nevertheless, subdued oil prices also 
reduced the value of imports quite substantially. 
Thailand’s current account thus continued to record 
a sizeable surplus.

that the crude  oil price will  be below  the baseline 
assumption  is higher than the risk that it will  
exceed  the baseline  assumption , due to the 
following  factors:  (1) Global demand  could contract 
more than the  current  assessment.  (2) Global 
supply could rise by more than pr eviously 
assessed if OPEC member countries (especially 
Saudi Arabia and Iraq) decide to ramp up  
production to maintain market share. (3) Shale oil 
producers could expand production earlier than 
expected.  On the other hand,  crude oil price could 
rise above  baseline assumption  if the Middle East 
conflict escalates  and causes a fall in global oil 
supply.  
Risks to Growth and Inflation Forecasts  
 According to the MPC’s assessment,  
the likelihood  that growth will be below the 
baseline projection is higher than  the probability  
that it will be above the baseline projection. 
This assessment is depicted in the growth fan 
chart, which is skewed downwards throughout 
the forecast period (Chart 1.8).  
Downside risks to economic growth  stem 
from the following: (1) Trading partners’ economies, 
especially China, could grow more slowly than 
anticipated. (2) The adverse impact of the Chinese 
slowdown on Asian economies could be larger than 
expected. (3) Incident in Bangkok could result in 
fewer -than-expected number of touri sts. (4) Public 
investment may  not spur private investment as much 
as forecasted  amidst low private sector confidence.  
Upside risk factors to growth  could arise 
from the following sources: (1)  The number of 
tourists in 2016 could surpass the forecast.

The Committee  judge s that headline and 
core inflation are more likel y to tread  below  
the central projection than to surpass it.  
The greater downside risk is reflected in the 
inflation fan charts that are skewed downwards  
throughout the forecast period (Charts 1. 9  
and 1. 10). The assessment is based on the risk 
factors co ncerning crude oil prices and  softer 
demand -side pressure s as economic growth could 
fall short of the baseline projection.  
1.2 Monetary policy decision   
 The MPC maintained the policy rate, 
giving due weight to maintaining  financial market 
stability amids t heightened global market volatility. 
Prior policy easing  contributed to more 
accommodative  monetary  conditions . At present, 
overall monetary policy conditions remained 
accommodative. This was reflected by the 
exchange rate movements that stays conductive  
to the economy economic recovery and firms’ cost 
of funds in the money market that had declined 
following the previous policy rate reductions.

view that monetary policy stance should continue 
to be accommodative t o support the economic 
recovery . The Committee also placed emphasis 
on enhanc ing the effectiveness of monetary policy 
transmission, especially to the real economy , a 
task that requires continued monitoring and 
evaluation. In addition, the MPC will monitor 
imbalances that may build up as a result of  a 
prolonged  low interest environment . 
Between the MPC meetings on June 10 
and August 5, 2015, global and regional financial 
markets  exhibited higher volatility. Contributing  
to increased volatility were mounting market 
expectations  that the Fed would increase the 
policy rate by year -end, concerns over the 
Chinese econom ic slowdown and monetary policy 
direction, and uncertainties over the negotiation  
of Greece’s bailout package. These factors led  
to rapid baht depr eciation against the U.S. dollar. 
Meanwhile, Thailand’s economic recovery confronted  
a growing number of unfavorable factors , 
particularly the Chinese slowdown, drought, 
sluggish demand, and  persistently low oil prices.  It 
is likely, therefore , to be later  than previously 
thought before headline inflation turn s positive.  
Under these circumstances, the MPC 
voted unanimously on August 5, 2015, to leave 
the policy rate unchanged at 1.50 percent. The 
decision took into consideration the effectiveness 
and ri sks of additional policy easing amidst 
heighted global volatility. The MPC judged  
that overall monetary conditions remained 
accommodative.  This was reflected by the 
exchange  rate movements that stayed conducive 
to the economic recovery and firms' costs of funds 
in the money market that had declined following 
the previous policy rate reductions, despite Monetary Policy Report  September  2015                                                         13 potentially limited and inert commercial banks' 
responsiveness to additional policy easing in  
the current situation, because banks remained 
cautious with reg ards to lending under current 
economic conditions. The Committee thus decided 
to maintain the policy rate to support financial 
market stability, while assessing evaluating the 
impacts from previous policy actions on the real 
economy.  
Regarding long-term financial stability , 
some MPC members believed that maintaining the 
policy r ate could prevent further build -up of 
imbalance s in the economy . The low interest rate 
environment had persisted for a long period  and 
signs of increased speculative activities in the real 
estate sector  became more evident , albeit not at 
alarming levels.  Moreover, sluggish  economic 
recovery was due partly to structural problems, 
such as the lack of private sector confidence  
that weighed down investment, and declining 
competitiveness. Monetary policy may not be the 
right policy tools to address these structu ral 
constraint s effectively.  
Later at its September 16, 2015, meeting, 
the MPC voted unanimously to maintain the  policy 
rate at 1.50 percent . The Committee still prioritized 
the need to  preserve  financial  market stability, 
amidst greater global market vola tility caused by 
developments  in the Chinese financial markets, 
the renminbi devaluation , and uncertainty over  
the timing of the Fed’s  policy  rate hike . In this light, 
the Committee placed emphasis on considering 
the different global financial market scena rios and 
possible consequences on domestic economy  
before making a policy decision.  In the Committee’s  
assessment,  external stability  was robust  enough 
to absorb global market volatility . Strong external 
positions were reflected in the solid current Monetary Policy Report  September  2015                                                         14 accoun t surplus , ample  official international reserves,  
moderate level of external  debt, and sound 
management of exchange rate risk by businesses 
with foreign debt.  
In terms of growth  outlook, the MPC 
judge d that the Thai economy will continue to be 
weighed dow n by negative factors, especially 
those  associated with  the global economy, and 
downside risks that were likely to subdue  growth.  
Nevertheless, the overall monetary conditions, 
including the exchange rate, continued to remain 
conducive to the ongoing econo mic recovery. 
Some MPC members assessed that further 
reduction in the policy rate during this period was 
likely to have a marginal impact on the economic 
recovery, owing to financial institutions’ caution to 
extend credits and structural shortcomings that 
could not be fixed by monetary policy . Moreover, 
further policy easing may lead to imbalances  in 
the financial system over the long term.  
Going forward, the Committee were in 
agreement that the Thai economy would continue 
to face downside risks and therefo re warranted 
the need for adequate and ongoing support from 
monetary policy. In this regards, the Committee 
would stand ready to utilize an appropriate mix of 
available policy tools to manage the downside 
risks that could emerge in period ahead . The MPC  
also continues to evaluate and further enhances 
the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission 
in the current environment. In addition, monetary 
policy should play a role in shoring up market 
confidence, given that market sentiments have 
been quite  sensi tive to various developments, in 
order to ensure robust and stable recovery of the 
Thai economy.

Percent2015 2016 2017Monetary Policy Report September 2015   19 Effects of China’s  economic slowdown and   
the Renminbi devaluation  on Thai exports  
Economic data over the past year pointed to a slowdown in the Chinese economy . 
Flagging  growth has been a result of the  Chinese  government’s economic reforms , which  aim at 
promot ing domestic consumption as the main engine of growth in place of exports and 
investment , where both are projected to slow. The reforms  also emphasize develop ing more 
sophisticated production technology along China’s  supply chain,  thereby increasing  China’s 
capacity  to produce import  substitut es locally. Moreover, attempts to mitigate risks to financial and 
fiscal stability  inevitably contributed to  the slowdown during the transitional period. Financial 
markets generally perceived that the slowdown , to some degree, prompted the PBOC  to devalue  
its CNY Fixing Rate on August 11, 2015, with a n aim to bolster Chinese exports through weaker 
renminbi.  
The r enminbi devaluation  raised concerns for the markets that the Chinese slowdown 
could be more severe than previously thought , and  the Chinese currency could weaken further  
later this year . Several economies , closely connected with China, especially through trade  links 
where China is both a partner and a 
competitor , will be affect ed. (1) For China’s 
trading partners,  those  with a high share  
of final products in their exports to 
China , and those with a high share  of 
commodities in their exports,  particularly 
ASEAN countries, are likel y to experience 
the most adverse effect s. Their exports 
dipped  because of the softening demand 
from China, higher import prices on the  
back of weaker renminbi, and declining 
world commodity prices.  Nevertheless, 
those countries with a high share  of 
reprocessing  products in their exports to 
China will likely be cushioned  from the 
impacts , on account of higher demands  
from China  for their reprocessing products . 
This is due  to stronger Chinese exports  
driven by increased price competitiveness 
following  the renminbi  devaluation  (Chart 1) . 
In addition, countries whose export  
products  to China  have low price 
elasticity  (particularly those ASEAN 
countries that export food, apparels and 
energy to China ), will experience milder 
impacts than those whose export s have high 
price elastic ity, such as smartphones and 
automobiles. (2) For countries whose

China , particularly  South Korea, Thailand, Taiwan and Malaysia,  will experience higher impacts  
on their exports as a result of the renminbi de valua tion (Chart 2 ). 
The effect s of China’s 
economic slowdown on Thailand were  
greater than previously assessed in the 
March 2015 Monetary Policy Report. 
Not only did Chinese growth fall by more 
than previously thought , but the causes of 
the slowdown also magnified   the impacts 
on the Thai economy. That is, the 
slowdown was caused by weaker  exports 
and investment which, compared to 
domestic consumption, were more closely 
linked to imports. In other words, China’s 
domestic -consumption -driven  growth  
did not tr anslate into greater imports  
to the same degree that the exports - 
and investment -led growth of the past  did (Chart 3) . The effects  on Thai exports come via two 
channels:  1) Effect s on export s quantity, directly through exports to China and indirectly through 
Thai exports to countries that are highly dependent on commodity exports, and 2) Effect s on 
export  prices in terms of  lower commodity and electronics prices in the world market.  The details 
are as below.  
1) Effects on exports quantity  
 1.1 Direct effect on Thai expo rts 
to China.  The slowdown  led by  an 
income effect in the form of weakened 
Chinese demand for  goods used for 
domestic consumption ( final products ), 
which  constitute  an increasing share of 
Thai exports to China (Chart 4) . In 2014, 
final products accounted for 51.6 percent 
of the total value of Thai exports to China. 
However, most of these final goods were 
farm and processed farm products, such 
as rubber and rubber products, cassava, 
rice, fruits and sugar. Because China’s 
domestic production of these goods  
remained  insufficient to meet the local demand, the adverse effect s on Thai exports of these final 
products was lessened.  Meanwhile,  the price effect that the renminbi devalua tion would have  
on Thai exports  is expected  to be limi ted due to the fact that the baht had weakened by more 
than the renminbi since the beginning of the year (as of September 8, 2015, the baht had 
depreciated by 9.6 percent against the U.S. dollar, while the renminbi had fallen only by 2.6 
percent against the U.S. dollar).  Meanwhile , Thai exporters might face price renegotiation s  due to 
softer demand s from China and weaker renminbi. Nevertheless, the baht depreciation should help 
boost  exporters’ liquidity, partly alleviating the impact of renegotiations .

Source: Department of Custom, calculations by the Bank of ThailandChart 4 Share of Thai exports to China, by typeMonetary Policy Report September 2015   21  China’s economic slowdown did not affect Thai exports of goods used in the 
manufacturing of  Chinese  exports (reprocessing products ). These products, such as 
electronic, petrochemicals and chemicals,  accounted for 48 percent of total exports to China  
(Chart 5) . Exports of these products were mainly dependent on demand from final destination 
countries,  mostly G3 countries. However, 
although Thai exports of these reprocessing 
products to China could gain from renminbi 
devalua tion, the effect might not be as much 
as in the past.  This is a result of  China’s 
economic reforms which promote  consumption 
of locally produced goods, thereby lowering 
Chinese demand for imports of this group of 
products from Thailand and other Asian 
countries in the China’s supply chain.   
 Moreover, the effect of China’s 
slowdown on Thai exports compet ing with 
Chinese exports to the third countries was  
likely to limited .  Despite the fact that Thai and 
Chinese exports overlapped in many categories, 
including electronics, electrical appliances and machinery, closer analysis pointed to considerable 
differences between Thai and Chinese exports , both in terms of detailed product  types  and export 
markets.  (Chart 6) . Therefore,  to Thailand China is  considered  more of a trading partner than 
a competitor.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1.2 Indirect effect through Thai exports to third countries,  especially those that rely 
heavily on commodity exports.  The slowdown in China, a major consumer of commodities, 
caused commodity prices to fall to the lowest levels in 6 years, since the subprime crisis of 2008. 
The decline in commodity prices hit countries whose exports comprise a high proportion of

This has led to weaker demand for Thai exports from these countries, especially automobiles, 
metal products, food and beverages, and electronic appliances  (Chart 7) .  
2) Effects on export  prices . The fall in world commodity prices affected the prices of Thai 
exports, especially those that follow crude oil price, including petroleum, petrochemicals, chemical 
products, rubber and rubber products (these items accounted for 19.1 percent of total Thai exports 
in 2014). China’s slowd own  will likely cause commodity prices to remain subdued  going forward . 
Moreover, China’s recent expansion of production capacity in several industries, such as steel an d 
plastic granules, could lead Chinese manufacturers to compete more on price in the world market 
in order to compensate for softer domestic demand. This could exert further  pressure on prices  in 
the global market . 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Moreover, China’s slowdown led to falling global prices of electronic s  as China is a 
major consumer of electronic products (smart phone sales in China roughly totaled 30 percent of 
global sales , which  contracted for the first time in 6 years  in 2015 Q2 ). Electronics accounted for 
14.6 percent of Thai exports, and their prices are set to decline steadily following downtrends in  
global prices. Interviews with Thai exporters of electronics confirmed the outlook, as Chinese 
buyers renegotiate d for lower prices due to the weaker demand  (Chart 8). 
In sum, the effects of China’s economic slowdown and renminbi devaluation on the Thai 
and other Asian economies were more severe than earlier assessed. This is due to the  larger -
than-expected deceleration of China’s g rowth, as well as  the slow down in Chin ese investment and 
exports which, compared to con sumption, were more closely linked to China’s imports.  For the 
Thai economy, the income effect of China’s economic slowdown was greater than the price effect 
from renminbi devaluation . Quantity of exports also declined  as a result of the drop in Thai exports 
to China and third countries, especially those with a high share of commodities in their exports. 
Export  prices also decreased, particularly prices linked to crude oil price and electronics.  Taking 
into account of  these factors, along with the shifts in global trade structure and persist ent 
structural constraints for Thai exports, the Bank of Thailand has revised down  its exports 
forecast in 2015 . Specifically, Thai exports is projected to contract by 5 percent, worse 
than the earlier assessment of a 1.5 -percent contraction provide in the June 2015 Monetary 
Policy Report . However, although the value of exports in U.S. dollar terms will most likely  
fall, exports measured in baht terms are expected to remain stable or edge up  slightly due 
to the weakening of the baht against the U.S. dollar.

2.1 The global economy  
The global  economy  is likely  to expand  at 
a slower  pace  than assessed  in the last monetary  
policy  report  due to projected  slower-than expected  
growth  in Asian  economies.   
The Chinese  and other  Asian  economies  
(excluding  Japan)  expanded  at a lower  rate than 
previously  assessed.  In 2015  Q2, the Chinese  
economy  grew  by 7.0 percent  (yoy) , a similar  rate 
with the previous  quarter  (Chart  2.1). China’s  
service  sector  registered  a strong  growth,  
especially  in financial  services . However,  the 
manufacturing  sector  continued  to slow down , 
owing  mainly  to sluggish  investment  in industries  
with excess  production  capacity  and in the real 
estate  sector  burdened  with a high level of excess    The global  economy  is likely  to expand  at a slower  pace  than projected  in 
the previous  monetary  policy  report,  following  economic  slowdown  in China  and 
other  Asian  economies.  Advanced  economies  continued  to post a steady  growth,  
with the U.S. economy  recording  a solid expansion,  the euro area economy  
showing  pronounced  signs  of recovery,  and Japanese  growt h likely  to pick up 
gradually.  However,  downside  risks to global  growth  heightened  due to the 
slowdown  of the Chinese  and other  Asian  economies,  which  could  be further  
impacted  by global  financial  market  volatility  and renminbi  devaluation.  
  The Thai economy  continued  to recover  at a gradual  pace,  mainly  
supported  by tourism  and public  spending.   Looking  ahead,  the Thai economy  
continue d to face increased  downside  risks due to weaker  growth  in China  and 
other  Asian  economies.  Moreover,  lower  commodity  prices  weighed  down  Thai 
exports  of goods  and services,  lowering  employment,  income  and private  sector  
confidence.  As a result,  households  remained  cautious  with spending  while  firms  
delayed  plans  for investment.

2015  (Chart  2.2), together  with weaker  renminbi,  
could  have  adverse  impacts  on the real economy  
in the periods  ahead,  with the costs of production  
expected  to rise due to higher  import  prices . 
Nevertheless,  in the first two months  of 
Q3, the Chinese  authorities  introduced  additional  
fiscal  and monetary  stimulus  to boost  growth , 
including  (1) a policy  rate reduction  of 0.25 percent  
and an attenuation  of the reserve  requirement  
ratio (RRR)  and (2) expedition  of infrastructure  
investment  and relaxation  of local government’s  
funding  constraints . These measures  were  
expected  to facilitate  a soft landing  of the Chinese  
economy.  
Growth  in most  Asian  economies  
(excluding  China  and Japan)  slowed  in 2015  Q2 in 
line with contraction  in exports  and domestic  
demand  (Chart  2.3). Q3 data indicated  that 
exports  of Asian  economies  should  continue  to 
contract  due to (1) weaker  Chinese  growth  
affected  countries , which  export  a large  share  of 
final products  to China  and are net exporters  of 
commoditie s, (2) economic  activities  within  the 
region  remain ed weak  despite  higher  demand s 
from the U.S.,  and (3) weaker  renminbi  could  
affect  countries  competing  with China  on similar  
export  goods  to the same  destinations . Signs  of 
sustained  decline  in exports  of Asian  economies  
(excluding  China  and Japan)  had adver se impacts  
on domestic  demand,  particularly  investment   
and manufacturing  production.  This was reflected   
by a steady  drop in imports  of machinery  and 
equipment.  At the same  time,  private  consumption  
softened  as households  became  more  cautious  
with their spending  amidst  concerns  over the 
prospect s of weaker  manufacturing  employment.

continued  to expand , owing  main ly to solid U.S. 
growth  (Chart  2.4). In 2015  Q2, the U.S. 
economy  expanded  by 3.7 percent  (qoq saar,  
second  estimate),  up from 0.6 percent  in the 
previous  quarter.  The economy  was bolstered  by 
stronger  growth  in private  consumption,  due to a 
steady  recovery  in the labor  market,  and by higher  
investment  in machinery  and equipment  in line 
with rising  business  profits.  Net expo rts registered  
positive  growth , after having  been  disrupted  by 
temporary  factors , such  as the dock  workers  
protest  at the West  Coast  ports . The U.S. 
economy  should  see continued  expansion  in Q3, 
as suggested  by manufacturing  production  indices 
and retail  sales.  
The euro  area economy1/ grew  by 0.4 
percent  (qoq sa) in 2015  Q2, slightly  down  from 
0.5 percent  in the previous  quarter . Spain,  
Germany  and Italy posted  robust  growth . Growth  
in the euro area economy  was underpinned  by 
stronger  exports,  which  benefited  from the weaker  
euro, and stronger  private  consumption  on the 
back  of low oil prices.  Continued  accommodative  
monetary  conditions  should  help foster  economic  
growth  in Q3. 
The Japanese  economy  contracted  by 
0.2 percent  (qoq sa) in 2015  Q2, following  a 1.1 
percent  growth  in the first quarter , due mainly  to  
a contraction  in consumption  caused  by unusual  
weather,  a temporary  shock.  Consumption  is 
expected  to edge  up and provide  support  for 
growth  in Q3. Preliminary  economic  indicators  
showed  signs  of improvements  in Q3, such  as real

in line with the slowdown  in trading  partners’  
economies.  
Looking  ahead,  the Committee  judged  that 
the global  economy  would  continue  to recover , albeit  
at a slower  pace due to the slowdown  in Chinese 
and  Asian  economies.  Downside  risks to growth  in 
trading  partners’  economies  increased  from the 
earlier  assessment , reflecting  higher  risks linked  to 
the Chinese  economic  slowdown  and additional  
adverse  impacts  of weaker  renminbi  on exports  of 
Asian  economies . Moreover , developments  on 
Greece’s  economic  and fiscal  reforms  need  to be 
monitored  given  the country’s  fragile  economic  
fundamentals,  although  uncertainty  over the financial  
rescue  plan has somewhat  subsided  in the near 
term.  
The Chinese  economy  is expected  to 
expand  at a slower  pace  due to softening  
investment , which  is a result  of China’s  rebalancing  
of the econom ic structu re as well as financial  and 
fiscal  reforms.  However,  the government   continue d 
to stimulate  the economy  through  investment   
in infrastructur e and some  primary  industries.  
Consumption  growth  is likely  to continue  due to 
robust  labor  market,  while  exports  are expected  to 
gradually  pick up in line with global  recovery,  
especially  in the U.S.  
Asian  economies  (excluding  China  and 
Japan)  are projected  to moderate , due mainly  to 
weaker  exports.  Export  growth  shoul d pick up going  
forward  due to demand  from advanced  economies.  
However,  export  growth  is likely  to be modest  as 
growth  in China  and Asian  economies  are likely  to 
remain  soft throughout  the forecast  period.  
 Monetary Policy Report  September 2015                             27 The U.S. economy  is expected  to record  a 
steady  growth  going  forward,  supported  by improved  
fundamentals.  Labor  market  is projected  to recover  
in line with higher  employment,  while  wages  are 
likely  to increase  under  tighter  labor  market  
conditions . Private  sector’s  financial  position  should  
improve  from continu ing deleveraging.  Notable  risks 
in the future  include  (1) uncertainty  over the Fed’s  
interest  rate tightening , leading  to increased  financial  
market  volatility , (2) a slowdown  in investment  in the 
energy  sector,  due to persistently  low oil prices,  and 
(3) U.S. dollar  appreciation  hampering  exports.  
The euro area economy  is projected  to 
recover  gradually , driven  by accommodative  
monetary  policy  and low oil prices.  Moreover,  
business  and consumer  confidence  should  be 
bolstered  by the conclusion  of negotiation s between  
Greece  and its creditors  on debt repayment  
conditions  and structural  reforms  required  in August  
2015  to secure  the third financial  rescue  package.  
However,  weakening  global  trade  outlook  is likely   
to weigh  down   exports.  
The Japanese  economy  is expected  to 
expand  at a gradual  pace . Stronger  economic  
activities  are supported  by private  consumption,  due 
to higher  household  income s following  growing  
employment.  However,  export  growth  may be 
const rained  by softer  growth  in China  and other  
Asian  economies.  
 
 
 
 
 Monetary Policy Report  September 2015                             28 2.2 The domestic economy  
The Thai economy expanded slightly in 
2015 Q2 from the last quarter (Chart 2.5) . 
Tourism and public spending were  key drivers of 
growth. Over the same period, e xports continued 
to contract due to the following two factors.  (1) 
Trading partners’ econom ies were  adversely 
affected  by the slowdown  in the Chinese economy 
and the renminbi  devaluation , and by plunging  
commodity prices that hurt export revenue s of 
some trading partners and lowering  prices of Thai 
exports. (2) Structural problems within the Thai 
exports sector and shifts in global trade structure 
both undermine d the Thai expo rt performance.  
Downside risks  from domestic factors  are 
unlikely to have  as much of an impact  on the T hai 
economy as external risks . If violent incidents 
inside the country are contained, then the impact 
on tourism should only be short -lived. This year 
drought  conditions  are also beginning to dissipate . 
However, many potential  risks, on the whole , 
continue  to pose a threat to employment, income 
and private sector c onfidence, prompting households  
to restrict spending and firms to cut production 
and delay investment plans.  
Public spending, especially investment 
expenditure, and tourism have been important  
drivers for the economy.  
Public spending, both current and 
investment expenditure s, continued to expand 
from the  last quarter (Chart 2.6 ). Current 
expenditure (excluding government transfers) 
expanded, due to higher civil servant salaries and 
higher spending on supplies of educational 
agencies. Investment expenditure rose steadily,

2015,  budget disbursement s have begun  for  
the phase  II economic stimulus . Road transport 
infrastructure s and water management system 
projects are likely to see rapid and continued 
disbursements because they consist mostly of 
small and medium projects with completion  period  
under  one year.  
Going forward, public spending will continue  
to play a key supportive role for economic growth.  
The economic policy of the new cabinet focuses 
on boosting investment and employment, and 
bolstering private sector confidence.  Nevertheless,  
infrastructure investment  megaprojects which will 
help spur private investment , such as rail system 
development  and inter-city motorway projects, are 
still in the ir initial phase and requi re some time to 
make progress . 
Tourism continued to post a solid 
growth due to the growing number of Chinese 
and Malaysian  tourists , and the steady rebound 
of Russian tourists arrivals  (Chart 2.7) .  
Looking ahead, tourism is projected to  
expand at a slower pace. Tourist arrivals at 
Thailand’s major airports fell following  the 
Ratchaprasong incident  on Augu st 17, 2015, but 
still recorded a higher growth than last year.  
Several countries had issued travel warnings 
urging their citizens to be more careful traveling in 
high-risk areas, but none issued a travel ban on 
Thailand.  Based on past incidents, Asian tourists 
were most sensitive to unrests . However,  when 
there were volatile situations in Bangkok, s ome 
tourist s chose to change their tra vel plans to visit 
other parts of Thailand  instead . Therefore, if the 
situation is well under control , past experience 
suggests that the tourism sector is likely  be

 Service sector posted a solid growth 
following robust tourism  
The service sector in part provided 
support for the economy. Hotels, restaurants, 
aviation transport, and  non-durables businesses 
benefited from the rise in the number of foreign 
tourists. In addition, the telecommunications sector 
grew from increased  demand,  spurred by 
advancement in media and communications , together 
with service providers’  promotional campaigns  
(Chart 2.9) . 
Going forward, air transport service (which 
accounts for 2 percent of the service sector) faces 
increasing risks if the Thai aviation sector fails to  
meet   the standards  set by  the International Civil 
Aviation Organization (ICAO).  Revenue from air 
travels could slow over the period where the 
sector  are unable  to meet the required 
standards2/. Tourism revenue should not be much 
affected  because the number of tourists is 
projected to continue rising , while travelers can 
choose  other unaffected airlines.  
Exports contracted  in both quantity and 
price terms  (Chart 2.10)  
Exports contracted from the previous 
quarter  due to weaker growth in trading partners’  
economies in Asia, the Middle East and Australia. 
Because commodities form a major part of exports 
of these economies, they suffered from declining  
                                                        
2/ Based on the experience of other countries, including the 
Philippines, Israel and India, it took 4 -6 years for the 
ranking on credibility to be restored and for aviation 
standards to be improved.

thus declined (Chart 2.11) , especially in 
automobiles, food and beverages, elec trical 
appliances, and metal products.  Exports of 
petroleum -related products also fell due to falling 
crude oil price. Moreover, production of some 
export items faced  structural problems. Hard disk 
drives (HDD) manufacturing failed to adapt to the 
changing needs of today’s consumers, while  loss 
of competitiveness  continually  weigh ed down 
manufacturing  and exports  of labor -intensive  
goods, such as textiles and apparels.  In addition, 
shifts in the global trade structure led to a decline 
in global tra de, in part because some countries 
opted to produce intermediate goods locally to 
substitute for imports.  However, the fall in 
automobile exports this quarter was caused by a 
temporary factor, as consumers chose to wait for 
new commercial car models , manufactured in 
Thailand.  
Looking  ahead, the Chinese slowdown 
and renminbi devaluation are expected to have 
more significant effects on Thai exports, both 
through direct and indirect impacts. The di rect 
effec ts are likely to be smaller than indirect 
effects. In term of direct effects, exports of final 
products for consumption in China  have  continually  
declined since last year . The decline has been  
mostly in farm produc e including r ubber , where 
there is lower dem and amidst the economic 
slowdown and where China could partially 
produce locally.  Indirect effects occur from the  
slowdown in trading partners’ economi es whose  
exports  are adversely affected . Moreover, prices 
of Thai exports declined, especially farm and 
petroleum products, partly because of plunging 
global commodity prices (see Box: The Effects of

Devaluation on Thailand’s International Trade) .  
Declining farm inc omes and weaker 
consumer confidence prompted h ouseholds to 
remain cautious with  regards to spending  
Private  consumption  edged up from the 
last quarter , mainly due to increased spending on 
non-durables necessities and on services, such as 
telecommunications -related expenses.  However, 
spending on durables re mained low because  of 
last year’s drought which reduced farm output and 
income s (Chart 2.12) , together with  depressed 
farm prices. Non -farm household income 
remained stable. Households postponed purchase 
of high -value goods due to (1) weaker private 
sector confidence (Chart 2.13) , (2) elevated  
household debt and (3) financial institutions’ 
tighter lending standards for  household credit 
following  worsening  loan quality . 
Going forward,  private spending should 
recover slowly. Lower farm income and drought 
encouraged a migration of labor from farm  sector 
to non -farm sector , but most workers moved into 
relatively low hourly wages  jobs, such as 
construction, hotels and restaurants. Due to  
concerns over their  future income, consumers 
remained careful with their spending.  Furthermore, 
financial institutions have become slightly more 
cautious with regards to lending, due to concerns

next year.  
Weak domestic and external demand 
prompted firms to cut back production and delay 
investment plans for capacity expansion.  
Manufacturing production fell from the 
previous quarter mainly from the decline in 
manufacturing exports (Chart 2.15 ). Output 
contraction occurred in the following industries 
(Chart 2.16) : (1) Commercial automobiles, as a 
major manufacturer was in the process of 
changing production li ne for new car models  
(a temporary factor) . (2) Hard disk drive (HDD) , as 
consumers switched to new hardware requiring 
computer components made of solid -state drive 
(SSD) . (3) Food and beverages, due to a fall in 
beer production followin g a ramp -up in production 
in late March 2015, as well as a decline in frozen 
shrimp production resulting from a shortage of raw 
shrimps and continu ed decline in shrimp prices 
(due to offloading of shrimp stocks from India  
and Indonesia). (4) Textiles and apparels, due to 
high wages and constraints on production 
technology, as well as the European Union’s 
withdrawal  of GSP privileges which undermined price 
competitiveness  of Thai  products  relative to those 
made by compet itors.  
Going forward, automobile production is 
expected to grow  from new car models. However, 
overall manufacturing production is likely to 
remain sluggish, particularly manufacturing  for 
exports , due to feeble global demand.  
Private investment fell from the last 
quarter from weak domestic and external 
demand s. Most businesses invested in domestic 
machinery mainly to repair existing machines and 
improve production efficiency. Imports of capital

sluggish, as t he business sector still  had ample 
spare production  capacity, particularly manufacturer s 
for exporting goods  (exports accounting for over 60 
percent of total output)  whose  capacity utilization 
was lower than other sectors  (Chart 2.17 ). The 
private sector also awaited greater clarity on 
economic recovery and gover nment  plans on  
large -scale infrastructure investment. This is 
consistent with declining private sector confidence  
following a drop in sales orders (Chart 2.18 ).  
Imports dropped in line with subdued 
production and investment  
Imports fell from the p revious quarter 
(Chart 2.19 ). Imports of raw materials  and 
intermediate goods, excluding fuels , shrank . 
Contributing to lower  imports were a fall in 
machinery  imports consistent with subdued 
manufacturing production , as well as existing 
spare production capacity  for the business sector . 
Imports of fuels picked up somewhat but remained 
at a low level in line with crude price. Imports of 
consumption goods moderated as domestic 
demand has yet to fully recover .

 conditions   
Inflationary pressure s were generally 
weak, owing to declining domestic energy prices 
consistent with lower crude  oil price, and softer 
domestic demand. Looking  ahead, the MPC 
expected headline inflation to remain negative 
throughout the year, before  rising  gradually and 
turning pos itive in 2016 Q1, as the base  effects of 
higher  oil price in 2014 disappear . Core inflation is 
projecte d to remain positive at low levels 
throughout the forecast period. Defl ation risk is not 
at a worrying level . 
Global crude oil price fell recent ly, due to 
supply  glut and lower demand. Global oil supply 
rose significantly  because of increased production 
by OPEC member countries and the U.S., as well 
as the lifting of sanctions on Iran.  Demand for oil 
softened as a consequence of China’s economic 
slowdown. The resulting decline in oil prices  
dampened inflation  readings around the world 
(Chart 2.20) . Negative headline inflation persisted 
in Thailand, averaging at  -0.89 percent  in the firs t 
8 months of 2015, owing mainly to subdued crude 
oil prices (Chart 2.21 and Table 2.1) . Baht 
depreciation helped to soften the fall in the general 
price level through higher cost of  imported raw 
materials especially crude oil, but could not fully 
prevent the decrease in the price level .3/  
 
                                                        
3/ A study on the impacts of exchange rate on inflation 
finds that baht d epreciation affects headline inflation 
mainly through imports of crude oil, and only has a 
marginal effect on core inflation through imports of other 
raw materials. A 1 -percent fall in the NEER causes 
headline and core inflation to rise by 0.07 and 0.03 
percent within a year respectively.

The fall in the global crude price lowered 
domestic energy costs, including prices of retail 
oil, LPG for transport and households, and 
electricity. Since the beginning of the year, energy 
prices have on average dropp ed by 14.25 percent  
compared to the same period last year, there by 
reducing some transportation and production 
costs . This, in turn, led to lower prices of other 
goods and services, especially the costs of public 
transport, where energy cos ts constitute  36 
percent of total costs. Nevertheless, there have 
been no clear downward adjustment s of prices of 
goods and services oth er than public transport , 
because energy costs only account for 7 percent 
of total production costs.4/ This is consistent with 
changes in the prices of goods and services in the 
inflation basket, which reflected unchanged prices 
of most goods and services  (Chart 2.22) . Based 
on surveys with business  operators, energy and

last quarter, seasonally adjusted, by Bank of ThailandMonetary Policy Report  September 2015                             37 transport costs were a minor factor  influencing 
pricing decisions , relative to the cost of raw 
materials, wages and management costs.  
Business operators also tried to maintain their 
overall revenue amidst subdued domestic 
demand. However, some business operators 
adjusted prices down ward s and competed more 
aggressive ly on prices to boost sales.5/  
Aside from lower cost pressure resulting 
from lower crude oil price, demand -side pressure 
remained weak. Purchasing power was reduced 
by high household debt and lower income s from 
both farm and non -farm sectors, owing to weak 
exports. Exports were held back by the slowdown 
in China and other Asian economies, depr essed 
rubber prices in line with crude price and softer  
demand from China, as well as drought leading to 
lower  rice output .  
Low costs and weaker domestic demand 
caused core inflation to remain at low levels, 
averaging  around  1.14 percent for the first 8 
months of 2015. Food prices declined from lower 
raw food costs and the effect of a high base in the 
same period last year. Non-food prices fell in line 
with energy c osts and softer domestic demand 
(Chart 2.23) , consistent with all three inflation 
indicators which were below their past average s6/ 
(Chart 2.24) . Short -term inflation expectations 
edged down from significant decline in global 
crude oil price (Chart 2.25).  However, deflation  
risk level is not deemed concerning  as negative 
headline inflation was primarily caused by lower oil

slightly.  
The MPC assesse d that headline inflation 
should remain negative thro ughout the year and  
pick up slowly.  Technically, h eadline inflation is 
not officially cons idered to be missing the target 
because the target is the 12-month average.  
However, based on existing forecasts on the 
economy and oil prices for the remainder of the 
year, the 12-month average of headline inflation  in 
2015  is expected to fall below the lower band of 
the target.  Nevertheless, headline inflation is 
projected to turn positive in 2016 Q1 due to the 
diminishing  base  effect  of high oil price . 
Meanwhile, core inflation is forecast to be stable 
throughout the projection . The MPC would 
continue  to closely monitor inflation developments  
and continuously communicate with the public on 
inflation outlook.

3.1 Financial markets  
 Global financial markets  
 Volatility of the global financial markets 
rose substantially as a result of uncertainties over 
(1) the timing of Federal Funds’ rate hike since the 
beginning of the year , (2) the resolution to the 
Greek soverign debt crisis between late March  
and July, (3) China’ s economic conditions  and its 
stock market s, and (4) the devaluation of renminbi 
in August . The surge in volatility was reflected in 
the stock market , currency market , and bond Overall monetary conditions continued to be accommodative. Private 
sector’s funding cost s via commercial bank s stabilized after declin ing in 2015 Q2. 
However, funding cost s in the capital  market fell in tandem with government 
bond yield s, despite more recent increases  following sovereign  bond  sell-offs in 
emerging markets . The Thai baht continued to weaken, as a result of expectation 
on federal funds rate hike, PBOC’s recent  renminb i fixing s, and forecasts of 
slower -than-expected economic recovery for Thailand .  
The fragile economy worsened  financial positions  of households and 
businesses, especially small firms,  thereby lowering income and debt repayment 
ability of private sector. L oan quality of commercial banks deteriorated  as a 
result. N onetheless, commercial banks remained robust, owing  to high level of 
loan loss provision and capital base. For the real estate sector, rising excess 
supply of condominiums requires close monitoring . Fiscal stability remained 
robust , with sufficient level of treasury cash balance and manageable level of 
public debt. Although public debt is set to  rise due to new borrowings to cover 
budget deficit , the funds will be invested to enhance the economy’s l ong-term 
potential.

 Thailand’s financial market s 
Funding cost of business in the capital  
market fell in tandem with   lower  government bond 
yields, despite recent increases  following  sell-offs 
of sovereign  bonds in emerging markets . 
Meanwhile , money market rates stabilized , as 
policy interest rate was left unchanged .  
Money and bond markets  
 From June to mid September 2015 , money  
market rates stabilized , as the Monetary Policy 
Committee  maintained  the policy interest rate  
at 1.50 percent per annuum  on June 10 and  
August 5 (Chart 3.2). The yields on short -term 
government bond s (up to 2 -year sector) declined 
initially due to market expectation that the policy 
rate would be lowered further , given the weak 
economic recovery (Chart 3.3).  Nevertheless, the 
yields drifted slightly upward from mid- August 
2015.  
 The yields on government bonds of 
medium to long maturities fell steadily from June 
to mid-August 2015. Factors that contributed to 
the decline include (1) the fall in yields of U.S. 
treasury securities (2) portfolio reallocation  from 
risky assets to government bonds during the risk -
off period triggered by the PBO C’s adjustments of

mid-August, however, as investors’ concerns over 
Chinese economic recovery intensified , investment  
was pulled out of emerging markets’ bonds, and 
back into U.S. treasuries ( flight to quality), causing 
Thai bond yields to rise in line with regional  
markets.  Overall , compared to the  June 10, 2015 
MPC meeting, funding costs in the bond market 
declined (Chart 3.4 and 3.5) with the drop in bond 
yields, while credit spread s remained largely 
stable . 
 Going forward , the cost s of funding in the 
bond market will likely fluctuate with external 
factors, particularly the  initial  increase in the 
Federal Fund s’rate, as well as the uncertainty and 
divergence over monetary policy directions among 
major economies. These are key issues that the 
MPC continu es to closely monitor.  
Equity market  
Stock market became less overheated as 
a result of net sales by non -resident investors in 
emerging markets , including Thailand . However , 
the decline in the stock market  is expected to   
pose marginal risks to financial stability , because 
only a small  fraction of trading was funded by 
margin loans .  
Equity market overheating  continued to 
modertate  since  2015 Q2 as a result of two main 
factors . The first factor was net sales by non -
resident investors in emerging markets , including 
Thailand , in response to worsening  economic 
outlooks  for emerging economies especially 
China , and the expectation that the Federal 
Fund s’ rate will be raised by the end of this year . 
The s econd  factor concerns  domestic condition s

MAI indices  fell and foreign investors were net 
sellers in the SET (Chart 3.6), driven by the  above 
mentioned  concerns . At the same time , 
investment by retail investors in the MAI 
contracted  (Chart 3.7).  
Despite the recent falls, stock valuations 
are considered to be elevated . The P /E (Price -

above past historical averages and higher than 
those in a number of markets in the region (Chart 
3.8). However , risks to financial stability are 
limited , due to low levels  of trading funded by 
margin loans .  
  Foreign exchange market  
 The baht and most regional currencies 
weakened persistently against major currencies 
since mid -July 2015 (Chart 3.9). The weakness 
can be attributed to the market expectation on a 
growing  likelihood that the Fed will start to raise its 
interes t rate by the end of this year . Moreover , 
developments of the  Greek debt negotiation , delay 
in domestic economic recovery , and concerns 
over severe draught  added to the depreciation 
pressure .  
 From August to early  September 2015 , the 
baht depreciated steadily  on the back  of three 
imporant events : (1) the adjustment  of renminbi 
Fixing Rate by the PBOC since August 11, 2015 , 
sending the baht and regi onal currencies  weaker , 
(2) incident in Bangkok , (3) sell-offs of stock s and 
bonds in Thailand and other countries in the 
region  by foreign investors , triggered by growing 
concerns over the recovery of Chinese economy 
and conflicts in the Korean peninsula . However ,

Bloomberg2015Monetary Policy Report September  2015                     43 September 16-17 meeting moderately propped up 
the value of baht . On September 18, 2015 , the 
baht per U .S. dollar stood at 35.53, down by 5 
percent from the end of the second  quarter . 
Further , the volatility of the baht rose slightly  in 
this period , but remained low compar ed to  those 
of regional currencies (Chart 3.10).  
 The depreciation  of the baht against major 
currencies led to a 3.2 percent decline in the 
Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER ) in 
August 2015 , compared to the average for the 
previous quarter . Meanwhil e, the Real Effective 
Exchange R ate (REER ) moved in line with the 
NEER (Chart 3.11).  
3.2 Financial institutions  
Private sector funding costs and returns 
on deposits declined in line with the MPC 
decision s to maintain policy rate . Demand for 
funding also dipped  during this period . Also, 
sluggish demand for loans led to a reduction in 
competition for deposits  and new funds  among 
financial institutions .  
Interest rates , credits and deposits  
With policy interest rate unchanged  from 
2015 Q2 until mid -September  for the June 10, 
August 5, and September 16 MPC meetings , 
funding costs of commercial bank loans stabilized  
(Table  3.1). Actual funding costs, however, 
depend ed on each loan applicant’s credit risk, as 
commercial banks tightened their lending 
standards for both business and household  loans . 
Between May and July 2015, household credit 
growth remained largely stable from 2015 Q1

in lending, because of elevated   household debt 
and subdued farm income s. Despite some signs 
of recovery during 2015 Q1, new issuance of 
credits to the private sector declined during this 
period  (Chart 3.12)  due to the following three  
factors. (1) A growing proportion of large firms, 
particularly in telecommunication and manufacturing  
sectors, increasingly relied on issuance of 
corporate bonds (Chart 3.13) , while  in real estate 
sector the issuance had started to ebb (Chart 
3.14) . (2) Credits to medium and small firms 
contracted , given financial institutions’ tight 
lending standards and declin ing demand for 
credits. (3) A number of large firms repaid their 
loans. Overall, total private sector funding declined 
from 2015 Q1, as new bond issuance fail to offset  
the decrease in private credits.

Therefore, its interest rates are included in the Average of remaining banks rates in the table above .Monetary Policy Report September  2015                     45  Given the backdrop of  slowing momentum 
of private credits, commercial banks reduced  
special deposit products and steadily lowered 
deposit rates on these products (Chart 3.15) . 
Instead, some banks turned to  mutu al funds and 
insurance products  in order to maintain their 
market shares. As a result, household and 
business deposit growth was lower from 2015  Q1 
(Chart 3.16) , prompting  a rise in loan to deposit 
(including bills of exchange (B/E) ) (Chart 3.17) . 
Nonetheless , reduced liquidity of comme rcial 
banks did not impact their lending capacit y, 
because the reduction in deposit was part of the 
banks’ own adjustment s to stalling  credit growth , 
brought about by weak economic outlook .  
 The Senior Loan Officer Survey for  2015 
Q2 indicated that credit demand from businesses 
will stabilize in the near future , while demand from 
households will fal l, especially for  home loans. 
Meanwhile, financial institutions will continue to 
tighten credit standards, especially for small and 
medium businesses and households . In order to 
assess the effectiveness of monetary easing,  
the MPC continues to carefully monitor the 
momentum of private  sector  funding. Such 
understanding will constitute one of the factors  
aiding  monetary policy deliberation going forward.  
Stability of financial institutions  
 The overall s tability of the financial 
institutions system remains strong , although loan 
quality deteriorated somewhat following  economic 
conditions . Nevertheless, commercial banks 
maintained high level of loan loss provision and 
capital base that serve as cushion against 
deteriorating loan quality.

2011 2012 2013 2014 2015Monetary Policy Report September  2015                     46  Profitability of commercial banks declined 
moderately in 2015 Q2, following the economic 
slowdown. This was indicated by the fall in net 
profit from 59.8 billion baht at the same period last 
year to 53.3 billion baht during this period (Table 
3.2). The decline was due in part to a growing 
level of allowance for doubtful account s, whic h 
provided cushion against worsening loan quality. 
Moreover, net interest income fell in line with 
slowing credits and  falling  interest rates. As a 
result, return s on assets (ROA) decreased from 
1.48 percent during the same period last year to 
1.26 percent this year.  
 Weak economic conditions also weighed 
on repayment ability of the private sector, 
prompting a  declin e in business and consumer 
loan quality , particularly for SME loans , car loans, 
and credit card loan s (Table 3.2) . This is evident 
from the rise of  delinquency and NPL ratio in 2015 
Q2 (Chart 3.18) . However, with prudent risk 
management and sufficient  levels of loan loss 
provision, commercial banks should be able to 
withstand falling loan quality. According to the 
latest data , the actual to regulatory loan loss 
provision ratio stood at 165.1  percent , while the 
Capital Adequacy Ratio was at 16.7 percent.  
3.3 Non-financial sectors   
Household sector

household sector , given the recent downtrend s in 
household income s and repayment ability . Thus ,

sector , will requ ire close monitoring going forward .    
Subdued  econ omic recovery dampened 
household income s, as farm income s continued to 
fall both from both  quantity and price , and non -farn 
income (wages including overtime ) stabilized  
(Chart 3.19). As such , households remained  
cautious in spending and in incuring new debts , 
causing a fall in household credit growth from 6.6 
percent at the end of 2014 to 6.4 percent at the 
end of 2015 Q1 (Chart 3.20).  
The falling  income and high level of 
outstanding debt reduced household repayment 
ability , as indicated by the slight increase in the 
delinquency and NPL ratio from 6.1 percent at the 
end of Q 1 to 6.2 percent at the end of Q2  
(Table 3.2), reflected  particularly by deterioration 
in quality of car loans and credit card loans . 
Given recent developments , the impact of 
economic conditions on household income and 
repayment ability require close monitoring  in the 
future . Special attention should be paid on those 
with low -income and in agricultural sector affected 
by the draught , because  they possess  higher debt 
service ratio than other groups .  
Corporate sector  
Earnings of listed non-financial companies 
in 2015 Q2 saw a  slight dip from the previous 
quarter , as a result of slow economic recovery . 
Although the overall financial standing of corporate  
sector remained sound , smaller companies 
experienced  weakening  repayment ability . In the 
next period , the impact of economic recovery on 
corporate earnings and stability of this sector will 
have to be closly observed .

2015Farm income Non-farm income (wages including OT)1/ 2/Monetary Policy Report September  2015                     48 Current economic slump weighed on  
earnings of listed non-financial companies , 
causing sales and profitability to drop from the 
previous quarter . Asset turnover ratio (ATO) 
(Chart 3.21) edged down , especially in shrinking 
sales of the wholesale and retail sectors . 
Depressed sales volumes also lowered   profitability , 
as suggested by the decline in the median of 
operating profit margin (OPM ) from 5 percent  
in 2015 Q1 to 4.7 percent in Q 2 (Chart 3.22). 
Nevertheless , petroleum and petrochemical sectors  
recorded higher profitability , due to the decline in  
the cost of crude exceeding  the fall in retail prices .   
 The median annualized interest coverage 
Ratio (ICR), which indicates corporate repayment 
ability , stabilized at 4.9 times (Chart 3.23). When 
listed firms are classified into 5 groups according 
to their asset sizes, it can be seen that ICR of 
firms with smallest asset  size deteriorated 
substantially and is set to  worsen further. If the 
condition of these small listed firms is taken to 
reflect the situations of non -listed SMEs, due to 
the lack of act ual data , this appears to suggest  the 
worsening repayment ability of SMEs  as well . The 
increase in NPL ratio among SMEs is consistent 
with the observation .  
 Looking ahead , the impact of economic 
recovery on corporate earnings and financial 
standing requires close monitoring. Particular 
attention should be paid to  repayment ability of 
SMEs, which are more fragile due to lower liquidity 
and tighter credit standards they face.  
Real estate sector  
Excess supply in the real estate sector 
continued to rise , as consumer purchasing power 
stalled in line with weak  economic conditions .

Classified by business sectorsMonetary Policy Report September  2015                     49 position s, the development of excess supply  
should  be closely observe d in the near future .  
Demand in the real estate sector slowed  
from the previous year , as a result of weak  
economic recovery , declining ho usehold purchasing  
power , high level of outstanding debt s, and tighte r 
home credit standards by financial institutions . 
The number of new home  loans approved by  
commercial banks  over the first 7 months of this 
year dropped  by 7 percent from  the same period 
last year (Chart 3.24). Most of the fall was 
accounted for by low-rise projects , while new 
credits for condominium units expanded somewhat . 
Meanwhile, r eal estate firms continued to launch 
new projects , especially condominiums (Chart 
3.25), partly  in anticipation of the extensions of 
mass transit rail routes . With demand lagging 
behind  supply , excess supply has continued to 
climb . This is shown  by the number of cumulative  
unsold housing units in Bangkok and vicinity over 
the first 7 months of 2015 , which was 13 percent 
larger than that of the same period last year 
(Chart 3.26). Since the majority of excess supply 
was in  condominium units priced below 2 million 
baht, it reflect s the weakening confidence and 
purchasing power among  low to middle income 
households .  
As for the financial position of real estate 
companies,  most  developers  have maintained 
solid financial standing . As a result,  they should  be 
able to withstand the financial challenges 
associated with an increase in  excess supply  to a  
certain extent . The median asset turnover ratio 
(ATO) and current ratio (CR) of the se ctor stood at 
0.3 and 2.4 times , respectively, close to the 5 -year 
past average s. Yet, loan repayment ability of 
some firms started to deteriorate, as reflected by 
the fall in  the 25th percentile of interest coverage

pre-finance loan quality worsened slightly (Chart 
3.28) , while NPL ratio stood at 4.4 percent in  2015 
Q2, up from 4.3 percent in  the previous quarter.     
Going forward, stability of the real estate 
sector will depend on clarity of the economic 
recovery influencing  home purchasing decision s, 
as well as the ability of real estate companies to 
respond to growing excess supply.  
Fiscal sector  
 Stability of the fiscal sector continued to be 
robust overall. Treasury cash balance remained 
adequate  to buffer the lower -than-projected tax 
revenue collection. Moreover, the level of public 
debt remained low , a satisfactory level . In the 
future , although public debt is set to rise due to 
additional borrowings needed to cover budget 
deficit in the 2016 fiscal year, investment in two 
new motorway routes, and investment in 
infrastructur es according to the Action Plan, these 
debts should not give ri se to concerns, for they  will 
be for  raising  the country’s economic potential s. 
Meanwhile , quasi -fiscal activities aimed a t stimulating  
the econom y will require further attention, for they 
may raise future level of public debt.  
The outlook for fiscal sector remained 
satisfactory , as reflected by a number of 
indicators. (1) Treasury budget balance had 
increased and remained sufficient to meet 
necessary demand of liquidity as well as offset 
the projected shortfall of revenue collection 
this year, marking two consecutive years of

corporate tax from May to June4/. Moreover , there 
was an increase in tax receipt s from revenues of 
state  enterprises and contribution from excess 
liquidity of revolving funds . (2) The ratio of public 
debt to GDP fell slightly , and remained well 
below the fiscal sustainability threshold of 60 
percent . In June , 2015 , the ratio recorded at 42.8 
percent , down from 43.5 percent in April 2015 
(Chart 3.29). The r edemption of matured 
government and corporate bonds , together with 
capital repayments by financial and non -financial 
state  enterprises , contributed to the fall in the 
ratio.  
Going forward , public debt is expected to 
grow from borrowings  required to cover budget 
deficits in 2016  and  finance  two new motorway 
routes , and also to  invest in  infrastructures 
according to the transportation Action Plan of 
2015 -2016 . However , the rising debt  should not 
give rise to  concerns , since it will contribute to the 
increase  of the country’s economic potential s. 
Nevertheless,  quasi -fiscal activities aimed a t 
stimulating the econom y will require close 
attention, for they may push level of public debt  
higher in the future .

Over the past few months,  the Thai baht and  emerging market currencies persistently 
depreciat ed due to the expected tightening  of the Fed’s policy rate  later this year , the 
economic slowdown in China and other Asian economies , as well as the  renminbi  
devaluation . While the weak  baht may bolster the  recovery in the export s sector, the 
inevitable question is whether  the increased external debt burden in baht term  leading to  
external  vulnerability similar to the 1997 financial crisis. This box is an assessment of  the 
impacts of the  weakening baht on Thailand’s external  debt  burden  and external  
stability.  
Assessment  of Thailand’s 
external  debt burde n risk in the second 
quarter of 2015 finds  that Thailand’ s 
external  debt st ood at 136 billion U.S.  
dollar s, accounting for  33.3 percent of 
Thailand’s GDP , which remains  well 
below  the prudential limit according to 
international standard s1/. Moreover, a 
closer look into the country’s  external 
debt structure and the practice  of 
borrowers with foreign debt  finds that 
the impact of the baht depreciation 
on external debt burden  remains 
limited  due to the following reason s: 
(1) Ratio of baht-denominated 
external  Debt  
At present, 28 percent of Thailand’s external debt is denominated in baht (Chart 1) , 
unlike in 1997 when nearly all of the external debt was denomina ted in foreign currencies. 
The baht -denominated debt is  in the forms of governm ent bonds and Bank of Thailand  bonds 
held by foreign investors , and some private sector b aht-denominated loans , especially those 
belonging to holding companies. This baht -denominated debt  burden  is unaffected by the 
baht depreciation.  Although  the weakening baht may cause some foreign investors to 
offload  their baht-denominated bonds , which may further exert weakening pressure on the 
baht, this would not impact the debt burden itself.  
(2) Currency risk management  practice  by the private sector  remains sound   
Foreign -currency -denominated debt , which makes up 72 percent of total external 
debt,  are mostly hedged against risks from exchange rate fluctuations , due to the lesson 
learned from the 1997 economic crisis. The impact of the baht depreciation on foreign -
currency -denominated  debt is therefore limited. Within  non-financial  sector , a vast majority 
of the foreign  currency  debt is held by large businesses. An analysis of the top 50 ho lders of 
foreign  currency  debt ( as of 201 4 Q4), which contribute to approximately 50 percent of total 
external debt held by corporate sector,  finds that most of these  business have  engaged in  
                                         
1/ The prudent external debt -to-GDP ratio for middle income countries is between 48 – 80 percent according 
to the World Bank.

investment in foreign currenc ies, which act as a natural hedg e for their foreign currency -
denominated debt. These are businesses in sectors such as energy, electricity, automobile, 
tyres and food. Meanwhile, businesses whose revenues are in baht, normally  hedge against 
currency risks. For example, while 
the non-deposi t-taking leasing 
companies borrow in foreign 
currencies and lend in baht, they 
fully or largely hedge  against 
exchange rate risk s. The value of 
the debt burden in ba ht term is 
therefore relatively unaffected from 
exchange rate movement . 
Meanwhile, m ajor net importers , 
such as the petroleum industry , are 
able to pass on a large proportion 
of the  increased cost resulting from 
baht depreciation to wards  the 
domestic retail price s, while 
benefiting from increased export  
income s. In addition, in response to 
the baht depreciation over the 
recent months , importers and 
foreign currency borrowers have 
taken further  cushion against 
exchange rate risk by increasing 
their own hedging ratio s. This reflects the close monitoring and prudent practices  of the 
private sector under the changing environment  (Chart 2) .  
Risks arising from foreign -currency -denominated debts of financial institutions  also 
remain limited. This can be attr ibuted to the Bank of Thailand  regulation s, which mandates 
commercial banks to limit their foreign currency -denominated net assets and l iabilities.  At the 
same time, commercial banks engage in proper  risk management measures, for example, by 
ensuring overall currency and maturity matches for both asset s-and liabilit ies. Commercial 
banks’ short -term external debts are taken on to square position s as they provided hedging 
transactions for the business sector . Long-term external debts are mostly incurred to facilitate  
outward direct investments , which have been on an uptrend since 2012,  by Thai companies in 
other countries . The current situation differs from the 1997 financial crisis when most of the 
country’s external debts we re short -term debts taken on for long -term investment s in 
businesses whose earnings we re not in foreign curr encies, such as in the real estate  sector . 
These currency and maturity mismatches  were the main source s of external  risks to financial 
stability  during the 1997 crisis.     
Assessment  of Thailand’s External  Stability  
 Robust external stability  enables the economy to be able to effectively counter  
volatilities in the  global financial market s. It also reduce s the risk s of liquidity shortage or 
missed  foreign debt payment s, which may lead to the balance of payment s crises. When

implement policies in response to  such risks. Under th is framework, Thailand’s external  
stability is assessed to be sound and robust .   
(1) Flexibility of the economy 
in absorbing risks depend s on the 
economy’s reliance on foreign capital, 
as well as its liquidity  position  and 
external debt  burden . A comparison of 
key external  stability indicators among 
emerging market economies2/ can be 
found in Chart 3 . The indicators include:   
 Current Account Balance  
to GDP Ratio   
Over the recent  quarters , 
the Thai economy has continu ed to  
run a current account surplus , with 
an expected increase in surplus in 
2015 . This  is due , in part , to lower 
import s driven by the economic 
slowdown , and a plunge in the value of 
oil import s as a result of the sharp 
decline in the global crude oil price.  In 
this respect ,  Thailand differs  from the 
oil exporting countries whose current account balance s run a shrinking surplus or growing 
deficit.  The Bank of Thailand expects that Thailand’s current account surplus this year is likely 
to stand  at 25.5 billion U .S. dollar . Therefore this  reflects Thailand’s  ample  excess liquidity 
from domestic savings to finance the country’s investment, which reduces the country’s 
vulnerability in the event  of sharp capital outflow s. As of  2015  Q2, Thailand’s current account 
balance as a percentage of GDP stood at 4.2 percent – well above the  median of 0.7  percent 
for the emerging market economies.  
  External  Debt to GDP Ratio   
 A country’s external  debt to GDP ratio reflects its debt repayment ability.  For the 
case of Thailand, the ratio s tands at 33.3 percent (as of 2015  Q2), indicating  Thailand’s 
dependence on external borrowing  is below the median of for the emerging markets  at 
40 percent.  Moreover, the country has strong debt repayment ability, as reflected in the debt 
service ratio of 4.9 percent  – well below the internationally accep ted threshold  of 20 percent 
according to the World Bank.  
  Liquidity indicators , including short -term external debt to total external  debt ratio 
and international reserves to short -term external debt ratio  
  The short -term external debt to total external debt ratio reflects the level of 
dependency on short -term ex ternal debt. A high ratio indicate s that a country runs a  high risk

Source: BOT, IMF, IIF and World BankMonetary Policy Report  September 2015   57 in the event of  foreign currency liquidity shortage . For Thailand, the ratio currentl y stands at 
40 percent,  higher than the median of the emerging markets. In the broad  picture, however, 
such figure does not reflect a worrying  level of  risks to Thailand’s external liquidity 
position , as the  majority of Thailand’s short -term debt is foreign currencies borrowed by 
commercial banks for currency hedging transactions demanded by  the business sector. 
Hedging transaction s only possess  limited currency and maturity mi smatches. Most 
importantly, the amount of short -term debt is relatively small in comparison to international 
reserves, as indicated  by the  ratio of  international reserves to short -term external debt . 
Analyst s and investors attach high importance to this ratio in assessing a country’s risks to  the 
balance of payment s crisis . This indicator reflects the country’s ability to absorb shock s from  
potential capital flow volatiles . At present , the ratio currently stands at 2.9 time s for 
Thailand , well above the international  threshold  of one -to-one. Thailand,  therefore , maintains 
ample level of  international reserves for the repayment of its short -term debt in case the 
existing short -term debt cannot be extended . 
 (2) The government’s ability to implement policies in response to  risks  
  The effectiveness  of maintaining external stability and balance  also depends on 
the policy space  available to policy -makers , on both monetary and fiscal sides . 
 Monetary Policy   
While inflationary pressure s are low and the risk to financial stability is limited,  
monetary policy  stance  can continue to be sufficiently accommodative to lend  support to 
economic recovery. Looking ahead , should any factors pose a risk to  Thailand’s external  
stability, the Bank of Thailand has adequate policy tools to counter those risks.  In 
addition, under the inflation targeting framework and the managed float regime , the 
exchange rate is allowed to  adjust to market mechanisms and economic fundamentals, 
reducing the pre-conditions for currency speculative attacks. The Bank of Thailand will  
intervene  in cases of sudden and extreme  movements of the exchange rate to the extent that 
it would negatively affec t the confidence and the adjustment ability of the private sector. 
Moreover, the current amount of international reserves is sufficient to respond to volatilit ies in 
the global financial market s.  
 Fiscal Policy   
Thailand  has sufficient fiscal policy  space to maintain macro economic  stability 
resulting from volatile capital flows , as reflected by its low fiscal deficit to GDP ratio of -1.9 
percent in the 2015 fiscal year, and its public debt to GDP ratio of 42.8 percent (as of July 
2015), which is well below the 60 percent limit of the  fiscal sustainability framework. Thailand 
therefore has the policy flexibility to respond to changing external environment , if necessary.  
In conclusion, the MPC judge d that a sharp depreciation of the baht will likely have 
limited impact s on Thailand’s external  stability. However, against the backdrop of the 
uncertainties in the globa l financial market s and weak domestic  economic recovery, there is a 
possi bility that baht volatility will  persist , which may  potentially  impact the country’s economi c 
stability in the periods ahead . Therefore, the public  sector  and the private sector  should 
collaborate  in monitor ing and assessing  various risk factors  as well as  undertake  
necessary adjustment s and appropriate risk management measures  in a proper and 
timely manner.  Monetary Policy Report  September 2015   58 Assessing the Risks of Cumulative Excess  Supply and Speculation in  
the Real Estate Market  
Over the past 3 – 4 years, 
the cumulative  excess supply of 
housing, especially condominiums 
in the Bangkok metropolitan  area, 
has been steadily increasing1/ 
(Chart 1 ). This is a result of  waning  
demand in the real estate market 
driven by the slow economic 
recovery, while the real estate 
developers continue d to launch  new 
projects.  Cumulative  supply of 
condominium un its is expected 
to continue to build up  for the 
second half of 20 15 on account of  
the following factors.  (1) Several 
condominium proje cts are to be 
completed  within this year, as many  
projects were  launched 2 -3 years ago.  (2) Developers also plan to launch a large number of 
new projects this year (Chart 2). (3) The proportion of the transfer of ownership to the number 
of units reserved two years prior has decreased since 2014  Q3 (Chart 3 ), partly  attribut able to 
the delay in the construction progress, but this could be  due to the buyers  changed the ir 
minds about owning the properties  or failure to obtain mortgage from financial institutions to 
complete the transf ers. There is therefore  high likelihood th at cumulative excess supply of 
condominium s will continue to rise, going forward . 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
                                         
1/  While the number of excess supply of condominium unit is currently higher than in 1997, there is a smaller 
implication on the excess supply risk s because the size of the economy has grown by nearly 3 folds, and 
there is now a stronger  preference in buying condominium units for living. Therefore, t he demand should be  
able to better absorb the supply. It is expected that the excess supply in condominium units can be 
absorbed  within one and a half years, whereas it would have taken more than 10 years in 1997.    
Note: Time taken to clear accumulated supply of condominium is calculated 
using the number of accumulated supply divided by the number of 
condominium units sold in the same year.

speculation through the buying 
and reselling of property 
reservation has gone up  since 
the first quarter of the year , as 
reflected by the speculative 
reservation index2/ (Chart 4 ). 
Such trend is  consistent with the 
information received from real 
estate developers that they have 
seen an increase in short -term 
speculation through trading of 
reservations . If the increase i n 
the speculation transactions 
exceed the developers’ estimate , 
it may mislead deve lopers  into 
launch ing new condominium 
projects  based on inaccurate 
information.  In the event that  speculators are unable to find real buyers for these 
condominium units once the construction is completed, these units then lead to  additional 
financial burden  for developers  and worsen  the excess supply in the marke t.  
Assessments of Real Estate Sector Risk s to Financial Stability   
 Despite the increasing risk from excess supply and short -term speculations in the 
condominium market, its impact s at present on financial and macro economic stability 
remains limited . This is because the majority  of the  market belongs to  large listed companies 
with sound risk management measures and strong financial position, which  enable  them to 
cushion potential financial impacts. The developers have also adjusted to the changing 
market environment, including focusing its projects towards buyers with higher purchasing 
power s and delaying or cancelling projects with low reservation rate.  
 In addition, over recent months , commercial banks have become more cautious in 
extending loans , both in the pre -financing process for  developers , especially through close 
monitoring of speculative reservations, and in the post -financing process through careful 
evaluation of the individuals’ debt repayment ability. Nonetheless , commercial banks have not 
been too  stringent to the point where creditworthy borrowers are unable to borrow, as 
reflected by the ratio of housing price to borrower’s income, which  remains close to the past 
average s . Such careful monitoring and solid financial positions of commercial banks play an 
important role in reducing the risk s to financial stability  and in mitigating the impact s from 
excess supply and speculation  in the real estate sector  
 However, there is also a trend among major developers to be less dependen t on 
commercial bank loans. Instead, companies look for capital  from other channels , such as

of condominium units reserved during the first month of the launch to 
the number of new units launched in the same month, with quarterly

funds (Chart 5) . Such shift shows 
positive development in the capital 
market , which becomes an increasingly 
important source of finance, in addition 
to commercial banks. That said,  it, 
however , creates a channel where risks 
from the real estate  sector  can directly 
impact  the capital market, affecting 
institutional and individual investors  
alike. The MPC therefore continue s to 
monitor the economic recovery, 
influencing  propert y demands . The 
Committee also pays attention to the 
adjustments made by developers in 
response to the growing  excess supply  in the real estate market. If the economic recovery 
continued to be slow , there is a risk that demand for real estate would also further deteriorate , 
leading to price  reduction  for condominium units. This would undoubtedly weigh on  the 
income and debt repayment ability of real estate developers, as well as posing greater  risks to 
financial stability  in the future.
