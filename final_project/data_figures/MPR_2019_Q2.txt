Monetary Policy in Thailand  
Monetary Policy Committee  
Under the Bank of Thailand Act, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) comprise s the 
governor and two deputy governors, as well as four distinguished external members  
representing various sectors of the economy , with the aim of ensuring  that monetary policy 
decisions are effective and transparent.  
Monetary Policy Objective  
The MPC sets monetary policy to promote  the objective of supporting sustainable a nd full 
potential economic growth, without causing inflationary problems or economic and financial 
imbalances or bubbles.  
Monetary Policy Target  
The Cabinet  approved the annual average headline inflation target of 2.5 + 1.5 percent as the 
target  for the medium  term and for 201 9. The inflation target  is to assure the general public 
that the MPC will take  necessary policy actions to return headline inflation to the target within 
an appropriate time horizon without jeopardizing growth and macro -financial stability.  In the 
event that headline inflation deviates from the target, the MPC shall explain the reas ons 
behind the target breach to the  Minister  of Finance and the  public, together with measures 
taken and estimated time to bring inflation back to the target.  
Monetary Policy Instrument  
The MPC utilizes the 1 -day bilateral repurchase transaction rate as the policy interest rate to 
signal the monetary policy stance.  
Evaluati on of Economic Conditions and Forecasts  
The Bank of Thailand takes into account  information from all sources, the macroeconomic 
model, data from each economic sector, as well as surveys  of large enterprises , together with  
small and medium -sized  enterprises from all over the country,  and various financial institutions  
to ensure that economic evaluations and forecasts are accurate and cover all aspects, both at 
the macro and micro levels.   
Monetary Policy Communication  
Recognizing the importance of monetary policy communication to the public, the MPC 
employs  various  channel s of communication, both in Thai and English, such as (1) organizing 
a press statement at 14 :00 on the day of the Committee meeting, (2) publishing edited 
minutes of the MPC meeting two weeks after the meeting, and (3) publishing the Monetary 
Policy Report  every quarter.  Monetary Policy Report June  2019  Content

Financial stability assessment   Monetary Policy Report June  2019  1 Executive Summary  
Monetary Policy Conduct  in the Second  Quarter of 2019     
In the Committee’s view, the Thai economy was expected t o expand at a slower pace than the previous 
assessment as merchandise and services exports would likely grow at a significantly lower rate than 
previously expected. Headline and core inflation were projected to be in line with the previous forecast. 
However, there were pockets of risks that might pose vulnerabili ties to financial stability in the future. Thus, 
the Com mittee unanimously voted at the meetin gs on May 8 and June 26, 2019, to maintain the 
policy rate at 1.75 percent. The Committee viewed that the current accommodative monetary policy stance 
contributed to the continuation of economic gr owth and was appropri ate given the inflation target. Moreover, 
the Committee expressed concerns over the baht appreciation which might not be consistent with economic 
fundamentals and would continue to closely monitor developments of exchange rates and capital flows. In 
the pe riod ahead, there remained a need to address financial stability risks through a combination of tools, 
including the appropriate policy rate as well as microprudential and macroprudential measures which would 
need to place greater emphasis on debt servicea bility of borrowers.  
Against the backdrop of heightened uncertainties surrounding both external and domestic factors  
going forward, the current accommodative monetary policy stance was deemed appropriate.  The 
Committee would continue to closely monitor developments of economic growth, inflation and financial 
stability, together with associated risks, especially the impacts of trade tensions, in deliberating appropriate 
monetary policy in the period ahead.  
Assessment of the Economic and Financial Outlook as the Basis for Policy Formulation  
1. Global Economy  
The global economy was expected to grow at slower rate mainly due to escalated trade tensions 
between the U.S. and China, causing a decline in global tr ade volume and investor confidence. However, 
strong labor markets and consumer confidence as well as government stimulus measures in advanced 
economies would be key supporting factors for econom ic growth in the period ahead. The Committee thus 
revised the growth projection of Thailand’s trading partner economies downward to be 3.0 percent 
in 2019 and 2.8 percent in 2020.  Nonetheless, there remained possibilities that trading partner 
economies could underperform the baseline projection  due to uncertainties s urrounding trade 
protectionist measures that might intensify, geopolitical risks, and increased risks of the no -deal Brexit.  
Monetary policy stance of most central banks were more accommodative.  The U.S. Federal Reserve 
(Fed) would likely cut the policy r ate once in 2019 with an additional cut in 2020, compared with the previous 
assessment of one policy rate hike in 2019. The European Central Bank (ECB) would likely hold its policy 
rate until the first half of 2020 and launch a plan to inject liquidity in the financial system through the third 
Targeted Longer -term Refinancing Operations (TLTROs III). Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) was 
expected to keep both short - and long -term interest rate targets until at least the first half of 2020.  
Regarding centr al banks with policy rate cuts, some had raised their policy rates multiple times last year, 
such as the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). On the other hand,  
other central banks still maintained their policy rates such  as Bank of Korea (BOK) and Bank Indonesia (BI).  
Emerging markets (EMs) experienced volatile capital flows.  Capital outflows from EMs occurred amid 
intensified trade tensions, driven by both increases in import tariffs as retaliatory measures between the U.S. 
and China and the U.S. announcement to sanction China’s major technology company due to security 
issues . However, capital flows returned to EMs, especially Thailand and India, following a more dovish 
monetary policy stance of central banks in advanced economies. In addition, in the case of Thailand, other 
supporting factors included a greater clarity pertai ning to domestic political developments and a larger share Monetary Policy Report June  2019  2 distributed to Thai equities in foreign investment funds following an increase in the weights of Thailand’s 
assets in the MSCI and JP Morgan indices.  
2. Financial Conditions and Financial Stability  
Thailand’s financial conditions remained accommodative  as reflected by the real policy rate that 
remained accommodative and at a low level relative to those of other EMs. Thailand’s short -term interest 
rates in the money market and short -term government b ond yi elds were broadly in line with the policy rate. 
Medium - and long -term government bond yields fell in accordance with the U.S. treasury yields. Private 
credit moderated, partly due to a partial loan repayment by large corporates after having switched to 
corporate bond financing. As a result, financing through the bond and equity markets continued to rise. 
Meanwhile, credit extended to households continued to grow in all loan types. The baht appreciated against 
the U.S. dollar relative to the end of the  previous quarter, especially following intensified trade tensions and 
a greater clarity pertaining to Thailand’s political developments. The real effective exchange rate also 
appreciated partly due to the baht appreciation against most trading partner cur rencies.  
There were pockets of risks in the financial system that could pose vulnerabilities to financial 
stability in the future.  These included (1) an accumulation of household debt and deterioration of debt 
serviceability among some group of households and small businesses, (2) the search -for-yield behavior, 
particularly among saving cooperatives and large corporates, and (3) risks in the property sector including  
a decline in foreign demand for Thai condominiums in response to the global economic slowd own which 
could lengthen time to sell existing excess supply. Nevertheless, risks in the property sector were partly 
addressed through the revised loan -to-value ratio (LTV) measure, as observed in developers’ adjustments 
by delaying launches of new project s and overall housing price index that remained largely unchanged. 
Moreover,  financial institutions would be more cautious in expanding mortgage loans, especially those for 
second and subsequent residential units acquired by the same purchasers.  
3. Econom ic and Inflation Outlook  
The Thai economy was expected to expand at a slower rate of 3.3 and 3.7 percent in 2019 and 2020, 
respectively,  down from the projection in the previous Monetary Policy Report . The  downward revision was 
mainly due to external deman d, where growth of merchandise and services exports was projected to be 
lower than the previous assessment following a slowdown of trading partner economies and global trade 
volume. Moreover, private consumption and investment were expected to moderate fro m the previous year. 
Meanwhile, government spending would continue to support growth albeit at a lesser extent than previously 
assessed.  
The value of merchandise exports in 2019 was expected to remain broadly unchanged from the 
previous year, a downward r evision from the previous forecast . This was a result of intensified trade 
tensions which dampened global trade volume and external demand. However, Thai merchandise exports 
in the period ahead would be supported by the relocation of production base of som e businesses to Thailand 
and 5G technology -related infrastructure investment plans in many countries, which would promote global 
trade and investment. This would, in turn, benefit Thailand’s exports of electronics parts going forward.  
Exports of services were projected to decelerate and exhibit a slower growth than previously 
assessed  due to a decreased number of foreign tourists and lower spending per head. Meanwhile, global 
economic slowdown would likely result in a moderate outlook of tourists traveling  to regional countries 
including Thailand. However, in the period ahead, extended exemption of visa -on-arrival (VOA) fees until 
the end of October 2019 and greater tourism promotion by both government and the private sector might 
partly help offset the imp act. Therefore, the projected number of foreign tourists was revised down to 39.9 
and 41.3 million in 2019 and 2020, respectively.  Monetary Policy Report June  2019  3 Private consumption in 2019 was expected to moderate compared to the high growth last year, but 
would continue to expand.  Supporting factors included sales promotion continuously offered by 
businesses, as well as government measures which helped support household consumption to some extent. 
However, private consumption in the period ahead would be restrained by non -farm househo ld income given 
signs of moderation in earnings, particularly in export -related manufacturing sector, and lower consumer 
confidence among low -income households due to elevated household debt.  
Private investment was expected to continue expanding  despite at a lower rate than the previous 
assessment following a softer outlook of exports and a de cline in investment confidence of businesses. 
However, private investment in 2020 was projected to improve, thanks to a greater clarity of some mega -
investm ent projects, outlook for additional relocation of production base to Thailand especially industries 
affected by trade protectionist measures, and the progress on  infrastructure development in the Eastern 
Economic Corridor (EEC).  
Public spending was proje cted to support economic growth at a lesser extent than previously 
assessed.  The downward revision was mainly due to public investment. Investment by the central 
government decreased due to an expected delay in the enactment of the Annual Budget Expenditur e Act, 
B.E. 2563 (A.D. 2020) following a delayed formation of the new government. Moreover, investment by  
state-owned enterprises also declined from postponement of some investment projects due to contract 
reviews and problems in accessing construction si tes, as well as changes in construction plans. Meanwhile, 
public consumption was expected to moderate slightly due to decelerating trend of personnel compensation 
expenditure.  
Headline inflation was projected to be in line with the previous assessment.  Core inflation and fresh 
food prices were expected to be lower than previously anticipated due to data outturns from March to May 
2019. In addition, demand -pull inflationary pressures would likely decline. However, energy prices were 
projected to trend up , especially in 2019, which would help offset the downward pressures, keeping headline 
inflation close to the previous forecast. Therefore, the Committee projected headline inflation to average 
1.0 percent for both 2019 and 2020, and core inflation to aver age 0.7 and 0.9 percent for 2019 and 
2020, respectively.   
The growth projection was subject to downside risks due to (1) a larger -than-expected slowdown in 
global trade volume and impact on Thai merchandise exports in the case of intensifed  trade protectio nist 
measures, (2) a lower -than-expected trading partner economic growth, particularly in the event of no -deal 
Brexit, as well as due to consequences of Chinese economic and financial stability problems and geopolitical 
risks, (3) a delay in the new govern ment formation which  could impact the continuation of government budget 
disbursement and policy implementation, and (4 ) a lower -than-expected growth of Chinese tourist figures if 
the Chinese government were to prom ote domestic tourism. However, there was a  possibility that the 
Thai economy would outperform the baseline projection owing to (1) higher -than-projected growth of 
Thailand’s trading partner economies, should there be additional government stimulus measures or better -
than-expected improvements on t rade tensions, and (2) higher -than-expected domestic demand as a result 
of (2.1) a soone r-than-expected implementation of government infrastructure investment projects, PPP 
projects and private investment, and (2.2) a larger -than-expected contribution from  government stimulus 
measures if the new government could accelerate disbursements or release additional measures to 
stimulate private spending. Meanwhile, risks to the forecasts of headline and core inflation were 
expected to tilt downward  in line with ri sks to growth projections and assumptions on global crude oil price.  
 
 
 Monetary Policy Report June  2019  4 1. The global economy  
Major advanced economies would  slow down as exports and private investment were mainly 
affected by trade protectionist measures  between the U.S. and China . Despite that , economic 
outturns of many countries in the first quarter of 2019 were higher than expected.  
In the first quarter of 2019, most major advanced economies grew higher  than 
expected. The U.S. economy expanded  at a faster  pace  than previously anticipated  driven by 
(1) strong  labor market,  (2) larger fiscal stimulus, (3) declin ing imports , as well as (4) inventory 
accumulation, partly as a result of moderating domestic demand and exports. Similarly, the 
Japanese economy expanded better  than expected due to inventory accumulation and imports  
reduction. Meanwhile, the euro area slowed down in line with previous forecast as manufacturing  
sector and producer confidence continued to weaken, while wages decreased in some countries . 
In the pe riod ahead, uncertainties surrounding trade protectionist measures 
would be the key factor contributing to the continued slowdown of major advanced 
economies. Merchandise exports would decelerate in tandem  with global trade volume. In 
particular, major aut o exporting countries in the euro area might be affected by U.S. tariff  
measure s on auto and auto parts  imports . Moreover , private consumption in some countries 
might be directly affected by trade protectionist measures, especially  in the  U.S. which  could be 
affected by tariff  increase s on Chinese imports . Besides , trade  uncertainties weighed on 
investment climate such that investment in major advanced economies w ere expected to slow 
down. Meanwhile, the manufacturing sector recovered slowly as business inventory remained 
high (Chart 1.1). However, some key factors would support economic growth in the period ahead, 
including (1) robust labor market and high consumer confidence, as well as (2) government  
stimulus measures in major advanced economies , such as assistance packages for U.S. 
farmers affected by  trade protectionist measures. With regard to private consumption  in Japan , 
there might be an acceleration in spending prior to government’s consumption tax increase  in 
October 2019.

Apr 19Chart 1.1 Inventory in the U.S., Euro Area, and Japan remained highMonetary Policy Report June  2019  5 Asian economi es would expand at a slower pace  mainly due to impacts from trade 
protectionist measures .  
The Chinese economy would grow moderately in 2019, despite improvements in 
the manufacturing sector and merchandise exports in the first quarter of 2019. Merchandise  
exports accelerated before the Chinese government reduced the export tax rebate rate from 
16% to 13% in April 2019.1/ This tax rebate reduction was aimed at alleviating impacts on 
business costs amid economic slowdown from the previous year and uncertainties pertaining 
to trade protectionist measures in the period ahead. Decelerating global trade volume and 
investor conf idence from impacts of trade protectionist measures would cause a continued 
slowdown in the manufacturing sector, merchandise exports, and private investment. 
However,  Chinese government’s growth -supportive measures, including infrastructure 
investment and  tax cuts, as well as an accommodative monetary policy, would be key factors 
shoring up the Chinese economy, such that it would not decline significantly and grow 
according to the government’s target.  
Asian economies (excluding Japan and China) were expe cted to moderate. In the 
first quarter of 2019, many economies experienced a slowdown due to (1) merchandise 
exports contraction in line with global trade volume (Chart 1.2), as well as (2) country -specific 
factors including delayed passage of the Philippi nes’ government budget and a decrease in 
Indonesia’s public investment to reduce current account deficit. Looking ahead, Asian 
merchandise exports would likely slow down in line with global trade volume and the 
electronics cycle. Meanwhile, softening inves tor confidence owing to trade protectionist 
measures might impact manufacturing sector and investment. However, robust labor markets 
and government stimulus measures, such as wage increases in many countries, would help 
support domestic demand in the perio d ahead.

Source: CEICMonetary Policy Report June  2019  6 Growth projection s for Thailand’s trading partner economies w ere revised downward, w ith 
risks til ting more to the downside.  
Going forward, Thailand’s trading partner economies were projected to slow 
down more than previously assessed in the previous Monetary Policy Report . This 
would be mainly due to the decline in global trade volume and investor confidence as a result 
of the following facto rs. First, trade protectionist measures intensified given that the U.S. raised 
tariffs on Chinese imports worth 200 billion U.S. dollars from a previous rate of 10% to 25%, 
effective on 10 May 2019. Subsequently , China responded by increasing tariffs on U. S. 
imports worth 60 billion U.S. dollars from 10% to 25%, effective on 1 June 2019. Second, the 
U.S. Department of Commerce issued regulations prohibiting U.S. companies from dealing 
businesses with Chinese companies identified as threats to national secur ity in the entity list. 
This was despite a postponement of regulation enforcement for 90 days. Third, the U.S. might 
further raise tariffs on the remaining Chinese imports worth at least 300 billion U.S. dollars. In 
turn, China might retaliate by raising t ariffs on the remaining U.S. imports worth 10 billion U.S. 
dollars. (Box: The U.S. -China trade war: Implications on the global economy and Thailand ) 
The Committee thus revised down growth projection of Thailand’s  trading partners from 
3.1% to 3.0% in 2019 and from 3.0% to 2.8% in 2020. (Table 1.1)  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Committee assessed that there were possibilities that trading partners ’ 
growth could underperform the baseline projection in line with greater downside risks . 
Such risks included,  first, uncertainties pertaining to trade protectionist measures that could be 
prolonged and expanded  to other countries including Mexico, India, and Europe. Those 
uncertainties  could affect global trade volume  and Thailand  through supply chain linkages ,  
as well as additionally dampen investor confidence. Despite that , there were some 
improvement s in recent period s after the U.S. announced an indefinite  postpone ment of tariff 
increase s on Mexican imports  in return for negotiation s about  illegal immigra tion. Second, 
intensified geopolitical risks might lead to volatilities in financial and commodity markets , 
including risks from  (1) the end of U.S. sanction s exemptions period on Iran’s oil exports which

denuclearization agreement between the U.S. and North Korea which lacked progress. Third, the 
risk of no -deal Brexit increased after Boris Johnson, a  hard Brexiteer, became the frontrunner in 
the first round of Conservativ e party leader election . The elected party leader would  replace 
Theresa May, who resigned as Prime Minister on 7 June 2019.  
The global economy was expected to exhibit slower growth due to uncertainties pertaining to 
trade protectionist measures. Monetary policy of most central banks became more dovish  as 
some central banks cut their policy rates.  
 Monetary policies of major advanced economies ’ central banks became more 
accommodative  to prepare and cope with uncertainties regarding potential global economic 
slowdown  and intensified trade protectionist measures. The Federal Reserve (Fed) was 
expected to cut the policy rate once in 2019 with an additional cut in 2020 , instead of gradual 
policy rate increases as previously anticipated. The European Cent ral Bank (ECB) was 
expected to keep the policy rate unchanged until the first half of 2020 . The possibility of a n ECB  
rate cut  also increased in the case of significant  econom ic slowdown. The ECB would also 
implement a plan to inject liquidity in the finan cial system through the third targeted longer -term 
refinancing operations (TLTROs) (beginning September 2019 until March 2021). T LTROs  would 
help businesses  to continu ally access low -cost financing. Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) 
would still maintain s hort-term and long -term interest targets until at least the first half of 2020.  
Some regional central banks lowered their policy rates after continuous policy 
rate increase s in the previous year.  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) lowered the policy 
rate given a softer economic outlook and a decrease in inflation toward s the 3 ± 1% target. The 
Reserve Bank of India (RBI) also lowered the policy rate as the economy was projected to slow 
down and output gap was expected to be negative. The two central banks cut their policy rates 
after having continuously increased policy rates in 2018 . The policy rates were cut due to 
concerns over higher -than-target inflation . The cuts were also to safeguard against capital 
outflow risks following market expectation s of a Fed rate hike. In addition , Bank Negara Malaysia 
(BNM) also cut the policy rate amid signs of economic slowdown from impacts of trade 
protectionist measures and tightening  financial conditions.  Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) cut 
its policy rate for the fir st time after keeping the rate  unchanged  since 2016 . This was  mainly in 
response to slow wage  rises and lower -than-target inflation.  Other central banks still kept the 
policy rates unchanged  such as Bank of Korea (BOK) and Bank Indonesia (BI)  
Capital outf lows from emerging markets (EMs) occurred during periods of  intensified  trade 
tensions. However, capital flows returned to EMs after major advanced economies ’ central 
banks communicated more dovish monetary policy stance.  
In the beginning of the second quarter in 2019, overall risks in the global financial market  
abated as reflected by the falling VIX index2/ in April. The decline was driven by several  factors 
(Chart  . ) including ( ) major advanced economies’ central  bank s communicated  more dovish 
monetary policy stance,  (2) lower risk of Brexit following the postponement of Brexit process 
deadline to 31 October 2019, as well as  (3) latest U.S. and China’s economic outturns being  
better than market expectations . Investors thus increased portfolio  investment  in EM assets, 
                                                
2/ VIX Index is a measure of the stock market volatility implied by S&P 500 Index options  Monetary Policy Report June  2019  8 particularly equities. Later in May, overall risks in the global financial market heightened following 
intensif ied trade tensions, from announcements o f retaliatory  tariff increases  and of U.S. 
sanction s on major Chinese technology compan ies due to national security concerns . The 
announcements  resulted in the rising  VIX index, decline s in global stock indices, and capital 
outflows from EMs. However, in early June, central banks of major advanced economies, 
especially the Fed and ECB, communicated more dovish monetary policy stance. Capital flows 
thus returned to EMs, especially Thailand and India. In addition, Thai financial market s were  
supported by greater clarity pertaining to  domestic political situation . Moreover , foreign funds 
allocated higher investment shares to Thai equities and bonds in tandem  with increase s in 
Thailand’s  weights in the MSCI and JP Morgan  benchmark  indices.  
Looking ahead, the global financial market s would remain highly volatile. EMs capital 
inflows  and outflows may  fluctuate in tandem  with uncertainties of the  ongoing trade protectionist 
measures , advanced economies ’ monetary policy stance, Brexit development s, as well as 
geopolitical risks that might impact  commodity prices.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Dubai crude oil prices in the second quarter of 2019 rose from the previous quarter due to 
geopolitical issue s which tighten ed global crude oil supply. In the period ahead, crude oil prices 
were expected to fall slightly from lower  demand pressures in line with softening glob al economic  
outlook, despite tightening  crude oil supply.  
Dubai crude oil prices in the second quarter of 2019 increased from the previous 
quarter due to tightened global crude oil supply. The tighter supply was a result of reduced  
production capacity of OPEC members and allies in accordance with the agreement to cut crude 
oil production. Other supportive factors included intensif ied geopolitical risks from U.S. sanction s 
against Venezuela, the end of U.S. sanction s exemption period  for Iran’s oil exports, and unrest 
in the Strait of Hormuz. However, crude oil prices declined since the end of the second quarter of 
2019 due to investor concerns about  global economic outlook that might be affected by intensifying 
trade tensions.  
The Committee maintained the projection for Dubai crude oil pri ce in 2019 at 65.9 
dollars per barrel (Chart 1.4), although crude oil supply  tightening  was expected as geopolitical

to slow down in line with the global economy, and would put downward pressure  on prices in the 
period ahead. The Committee thus revised down the projection for  Dubai crude oil prices 
in 2020 from 66.0 to 65.0 dollars per barrel . The Commi ttee also assessed that there were higher 
possibilities  of lower -than-baseline Dubai crude oil prices compared to  the previous Monetary 
Policy Report.  This was because the global economy might slow down more than expected from  
(1) impacts of trade protect ionist measures,  (2) accelerated  U.S. shale -oil production, as well as 
(3) impacts from the International Maritime Organization (IMO) ’s enforcement of the new marine 
fuel regulations which might lower demand for high -sulfur crude oil. However, crude oil pr ices 
might rise given potentially intensifying geopolitical factors, posing impacts on  expectation s of 
crude oil production capa cities and on investor confidence  more than previously assessed .

Implications on the global economy and Thailand  
In recent periods, the U .S. implemented international  trade polic ies more inclined towards 
protecting its  own trading  interest s, in order to restore  its manufacturing sector and support domestic 
employment. Various m easures relating to this  include d (1) tariff  measures  on goods  imported from 
many countries , such as tariff s increase  on steel and aluminum  imports  (2) tariff  measures  on goods  
imported from certain  countries, such as tariffs on  3,607 items imported from China, with a total value 
of 250 billion U .S. dollars , and (3) non -tariff barriers such as sanctions on major Chinese technology 
companies for national security reasons. Such measures weighed on global trade volume and 
merchandis e exports of several countries including Thailand. Moreover, manufacturing, 
employment, and private investment in related industries were also affected.  This article 
therefore aims to analyze the impacts of trade protectionist measures on the Thai economy through 
the following channels.  
1. Impacts on merchandise exports  
Over recent periods, growth of Thai merchandise exports value continued to decline . After a 
high expansion  of 12.4% in the first half of 2018 , exports value  in the first quarter of 2019 contracted 
by 4.0% (Chart 1), which was the first contraction in 11 quarters.  This was due to the impacts of trade 
protectionist measures between the U.S. and China. Al though the U .S. did not directly  raise  tariffs 
on Thai imports, Thai merchandise exports were nevertheless  affected through  three main channels 
as follows.  
1.1 World trade volume effect  
Trade protectionist measure s 
were  the main reason for slowdown in 
global trade volume and Thailand’s trading  
partner  economies . This factor  contribute d 
2.9% to the contraction in Thai export s value  
in the first quarter of 2019 (light green  and 
yellow  bars in Chart 1)3/. Meanwhile, the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) assessed 
that trade tensions would weigh on confidence  
and global growth . The IMF  thus revised 
down global  trade v olume forecast for 20194/ 
from 4.1% to 3.3%. However , developments 
in the use of trade protectionist measures 
remained  highly uncertain, as this situation 
                                                
3/ Contribution to growth in Thai exports value can be decomposed into the following channels.  
1. Electronics cycle : assessed from Thailand’s total electronics exports value (excluding exports to China)  
2. Substitution effect:  assessed from export values on items for which the U.S. imposed tariffs on China, allowing 
Thailand to increase market share (compared to 4 -year average) at the expense of China  
3. Supply chain effect : assessed from Thai exports value that contribute value -added to tariffed Chinese goods 
export ed to the U.S. Value -added were calculated using the structure of inter -country input -output table (ICIO)    
4. Chinese demand slowdown : assessed from the residual of Thai exports value to China after accounting for the 
supply chain effect  
5. Slowdown in economi c and global trade volume:  assessed from exports value of other items not included in the 
aforementioned categories.  
4/ Forecast as of April 2019  
Monetary Policy Report June  2019  11 could be prolonged or intensified. As a result, firms  delayed production and investment in order to 
wait for more clarity. This was reflected by continuous declines in the Manufacturing Purchasing 
Managers’ Index (PMI), particularly new orders for capital goods. Deceleration in advanced  
economies’ manuf acturing sectors were followed by deceleration in the expor ts value of Asian 
economies’ intermediate goods (Chart 2). Moreover, trade protectionist measures partly 
contribute d to a prolonged downturn in the electronics cycle , as well as sluggi sh recovery in 
global and Thai  electronics exports. This factor contributed  1.3% to the decline in the Thai exports  
value  in the first quarter of 2019 (orange bar in Chart 1) . 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1.2 Supply chain effect   
 Trade protectionist measures subsequently imping ed on the exports of countries 
integrated in U.S. and Chin a’s supply chains.  This was because most goods being tariffed 
were manufacturing  goods with high linkages 
to many  countries .  Examples of such  goods 
were  electronics parts, auto parts,  machinery, 
petrochemical , and chemical products . The 
production of these  export s products required 
intermediate and capital goods  imports from other 
countries . Countries most affected by  this channel 
were small Asian economies with high linkages  to 
China, namely Taiwan, the Philippines, Malaysia,  
Korea,  Singapore, and Thailand (Chart 3). The 
supply chain effect contributed  0.1% to the 
contraction in Thai export s value in the first quarter 
of 2019 (black bar in Chart 1), with the most 
affected categories being  electronics and optical 
instruments.5/ 
 
                                                
5/  Thailand is confronted with the supply chain effect in both direct and indirect ways. The direct effect is  via a decrease 
in Thai exports to China. The indirect effect is via a fall in Thai exports to other countries, owing to the decline in 
their exports to China.

Source   OECD TiVA, calculations by Bank of Thailand% of GDP for each countryMonetary Policy Report June  2019  12 1.3 Substitution effect of Thai exports in  place of Chinese goods in the  U.S. market   
 A decline  in U.S.-China trade may create  an opportunity for Thailand to export more 
to the U.S. market  in place of China . Products which benefitted from this channel were auto parts, 
integrated circuits, and machinery for rubber and plastic s production . This factor helped offset a 
contraction in Thai exports values in the first quarter of 2019  by 0.5% (dark green bar in Chart 1).  
Going forward, trade protectionist measures will likely be prolonged or escalated owing to  
(1) additional  tariff measures  which the U.S. could lev y on the remaining Chinese imports , with a total 
value of  300 billion U .S. dollars , as well as tariffs on auto and  auto parts that the U .S. might impose 
on other countries , (2) tariffs could be increasingly used as a bargaining tool for non-trade issues, 
such as illegal immigra tion between the U .S. and Mexico , and (3) non -tariff barriers (NTBs) could be 
employed more often, such as the case of the U.S. identifying  Chinese tech nology  companies as a 
threat to  national security. Consequently, international trade outlook will remain highly uncertain. It 
may also be  an important risk which might impinge on global trade volume and trading partner 
economies more than previous assessment by other organizations . Thus, firms should stand ready 
to make  timely adjustments in response to  possible changes. For instance, addin g product value 
could help firms to reap greater benefits from substitution effect. Moreover, firms should explore new 
export destinations to diversify impacts from China’s supply chain effect. This could be done by exporting 
raw materials to other countri es which manage to gain shares in U.S. markets in place of China . 
2. Impacts on domestic traders  
Trade protectionist measures also affect ed traders  in Thailand, as China may dump 
products which were not  exported to the U.S. in the Thai market. An analysis of imports from 
China and the similarity index6/, indicat ing product categories  most prone to Chinese 
dumping, reveals some signs of dumping from  China . However, the signs are still vague.  
Chinese imports value  accelerated in some product categories, inclu ding aluminum structures, air 
conditioners, vehicle parts, textiles, and electronics. Nonetheless, Chinese imports of these products 
accounted for less than 1% of total imports value. Nevertheless, should the U.S. decide to impose 
additional tariffs on Chi nese products with a total value of 300 billion U.S. dollars, China may further 
dump their products. Then, impacts on Thai firms would be  more  prominent owing to these firms’ 
lack of price competitive ness in the se product categories. Meanwhile, d omestic consumers  would 
be able to purchase imports at lower prices, but should also consider product quality issues all together .  
3. Impacts  on domestic manufacturing and employment  
In case global trade deteriorated  with significant effects on Thai exports, it may consequently 
lead to production  and employment cuts  in Thailand’s manufacturing sector , particularly the export -
related  industries.  Firms may eventually cut their employment  or compensation  of employees . In the 
first five months of 2019, there were some signs of production and employment  cuts, 
particularly over -time employment in some export -related industries.  However, some  of these 
workers shift ed towards services and trade sector s, which partially shored up overall  purchasing 
power and consumption . 
 
 
                                                
6/ Similarity index is calculated from min (Thai import value of product a from China
Thai import value of all products from the world, U.S.  import  value  of product  𝑎 from  China

high index value indicating that product “ a” stands a high chance of being dumped by China.  Monetary Policy Report June  2019  13 4. Impacts  on private investment  
Trade protectionist measures could 
benefit  some countries  thanks to  investment 
diversion.  Firms  may decide to relocate 
production base away from China  to countries 
with high potential  for investment  such as 
Vietnam and Thailand, to avoid impacts of trade 
tensions. Thai industries including rubber and 
rubber products, electrical appliances, 
automotive  (including tyres and inner tubes) , 
petrochemical  products , and electronics , still 
maintain competitiveness in the global 
markets, as reflected by Thailand’s revealed 
comparative advantage (RCA)7/ indicator 
(Chart 4). It is therefore possible that more firms in such industries will relocate production base to 
Thailand in the future. In recent periods, foreign direct investment in the electronics sector 
accelerated significantly (Chart 5). FDI from China increased continually  since the fourth quarter of 
2018, particularly rubber  products , metals, and chemicals sector s, despite  account ing for a small 
proportion of Thailand’s total FDI.  
In sum mary , trade protectionist measures will likely pose  impact s on the Thai economy 
through various channels , particularly the trade  channel via reduction in merchandise exports and 
weaken ing confidence  in many countries . This  partly clarifies the zero growth of Thai exports forecast 
for 2019  from the high outturn s in the previous year. Moreover, impact s through  other channels also 
warrant close monitoring,  including (1) Chinese dumping  that could negativ ely affect domestic 
traders,  despite limited impacts in recent periods, (2) production  and employment  in manufacturing 
sector, which may subsequent ly affect  household purchasing power , and (3)  benefits from foreign 
firms’ relocation of production base to avoid impacts of trade protectionist measures, as some Thai 
industries maintain competitiveness to attract this FDI .

2.1 Recent Developments  
The Thai economy expanded at a slower pace in the first quarter of 2019 , mainly due to 
external demand which was affected by the slowdown in trading partner economies . 
Domestic  demand continued to support the economic growth.  
In the first quarter of 2019 , the Thai economy expanded 2.8 percent from the same 
period last year . Growth moderated from the previous quarter and was lower than  previously  
assessed in the previous Monetary Policy Report , mainly due to merchandise and services 
exports . Merchandise export s were  affected by the slowdown in trading partner economies, 
trade protectionist measures  between the U.S. and China , as well as  the down  cycle  of 
electronic products. As a result, exports of manufacturing products, such as electronic 
components and  devices, and electrical appliances , contracted . Exports of other products also 
declined, including fishery products which experienced raw material shortages, and agricultural 
products, especially rice  as export prices in U.S. dollar term were higher than those of 
competitors . Meanwhile, s ervices export s contracted in line with a decline in tourism receipts, 
mostly on account of a decreased number of Chinese and European tourists. However , 
domestic demand continued to support the economic growth , where private consumption 
continued to expand despite some moderation in spending growth of semi -durable goods and  
services. Purchasing power was supported by improved household income and employment, 
robust  consumer confidence, as well as additional government meas ures aiming to relieve costs 
of living of the lower income group s through the second phase of the social welfare card scheme.  
Private investment slowed down in line with investment in residential construction, as well as in 
machinery and equipment used in office s and manufacturing . Meanwhile, public spending 
growth accelerated on account of personnel compensation  expenditure , while public investment 
contracted slightly in tandem  with lower investment  of state -owned enterprises , as investment 
of state -owned enterprises in this quarter was mostly ongoing investment of existing projects. 
Overall, the Thai economy expanded 1.0 percent in the first quarter of 2019 relative to the 
previous quarter, after seasonal adjustment.  
The Thai economy continued to gain traction from the previous quarter  in the second 
quarter of 2019 , as reflected by recent economic indicators. The key growth driver was 
domestic demand. Private consumption continued to expand across all product categories, 
thanks  to robust purchasing power and additional government measures aiming to relieve costs 
of living for the lower income group s that were expected to continue supporting household 
purchasing power . Private investment expanded in line with continu ed investment  in public -
private partnership (PPP) projects , including investment diversion of some industries to Thailand 
to mitigate the impact of trade protectionist measures. Public spending expanded on the back 
of personnel compensation expenditure and investment t hat resumed growth this quarter due to 
accelerated budget disbursements for central government investment following project reviews to 
comply with the master  plans under the  National Strategy.  Meanwhile, the contraction of 
merchandise exports moderated  for some product categories , such as electronics,  thanks to the 
trade diversion to mitigate the impact of trade protectionist measures , leading to rising benefits 
to Thailand’s merchandise exports. Moreover, some industries that relocated their production 
base to Thailand in an earlier period started to export  some products , including industries related Monetary Policy Report June  2019  15 to vehicle and electronic parts. Export s of agricultural products improved on account of fruit 
export s. Export s of services contracted mainly on account of a decline in foreign tourist  figure s, 
particularly Chinese tourists, partly due to a slowdown  of the Chinese economy . Meanwhile, the 
slowing outlook of the global economy resulted in a more cautious spending  of foreign tourists , 
leading to a lower spending pe r trip. Nevertheless, government measures to promote tourism, 
especially the extended exemption of the visa -on-arrival (VOA) fee s from April 30, 2019 to the 
end of October 2019, would help boost foreign tourist figures  going forward.  
Overall purchasing power continued to improve, mainly on account of employment and 
income of non -farm households , with s igns of a reduction  in employment observed in just a 
few industries. However, purchasing power of farm households warranted close monito ring 
given intensifying climate variability .  
The continued economic expansion in the recent period contributed to sound household 
purchasing power, both from improvement in income and employment. (Charts 2.1 and 2.2). 
Income of non-farm  households  continu ed to improve. Overall employment was stable, 
supported by employment in the services sector . On the contrary, employment in export -related 
manufacturing sector, such as auto as well as rubber and plastic industries, started to 
experience the impact of the  export slowdown and a reduction  in over-time employment , as well 
as an adoption of automation.  
Employment of farm households  continued to decline as a result of  the drought and 
migration of some labor to the non -farm sector.  Farm income contracted slightly  this quarter  
maily due to a decline in prices , especially price s of sugar cane which declined in line with global  
sugar price s, and palm o il given a  large output  to the market . Agricultural output  also contracted 
in line wi th a lower output of sugar cane  than the previous year.  Going forward, there remained 
a need to monitor the strength of farm income . In particular, climate variability must be 
monitored, as it would not only pose adverse impacts on agricultural sectors  globally, Thailand’s 
agricultural sector would also experience a significant impact given its heavy reliance on the 
climate . (Box : The impact of climate variability on Thailand’s agricultural sector )

May 19Monetary Policy Report June  2019  16 Headline inflation increased, particularly fresh food prices . Core inflation decreased slightly 
in line with core inflation in the food category .  
 Headline inflation averaged  at 1.19 
percent over the first two months of the 
second quarter 2019, an improvement  from 
0.74 percent in the previous quarter (C hart 
2.3). The increase was due to continued 
increases in fresh food prices in line with  
vegetable prices , as output was damaged by 
an abnormally hot weather. The increase was 
also driven by higher energy prices, particularly  
as domestic retail oil prices  rose in tandem  
with global crude oil prices.  
 Core inflation averaged at 0.58 percent over the first two months of the second quarter 
in 2019, a slight decrease from 0.62 percent in the previous quarter. This was mainly owing to 
core inflation in the foo d category , which declined (Chart 2.4) due to slower increases in prices 
of processed foods . This reflected that an increase in fresh food prices did not sufficiently pass 
through to prices of processed foods. Meanwhile, core inflation in the non -food cate gories 
increased slightly (Chart  2.5), mainly due to increased prices of public transportation services . 
In other categories, prices slowly increased despite a continued expansion  of demand, as 
structural factors encompassing rising e -commerce trends, inte nsified price competition and 
lower production costs from higher production efficiency weigh ed down core inflation in the non -
food categor ies in the recent periods  (Chart  2.1). 
 Short -term (one - year ahead)  inflation expectations  according to the survey of 
businesses in May 2019 stood at 1.9 percent, close to the previous quarter. Inflation 
expectations of professional forecasters in March 2019 stood at 1.5 percent, a slight  increase  
from 1.3 percent in the previous quarter. Meanwhile,  long-term (five -year ahead) inflation 
expectations  according to the survey of professional forecasters in April 2019 stood at  
1.8 percent , unchanged from the previous survey (October 2018).

Short -term money market rates and short -term government bond yields were stable around 
the policy rate. Medium -term and long - term government bond yields decreased  mainly in 
tandem with U.S. government bond yields.  
In the second quarter of 2019 , 
short -term money market rates and 
short -term government bond yields  
were stable around the policy rate 
(Chart 2.6). Medium - and long -term 
government bond yields  (Chart 2.7) 
moved mainly in tandem with U.S. 
government bond yields. Yields edged 
up slightly in April, partly owing to 
improved investor sentiments following 
better -than-expected U.S. and Chinese 
economic data outturns. However, from 
the end of May to June, yields dr opped 
following intensified trade tensions  
and lower -than-expected U.S. economic 
outturns, as well as a more dovish stance 
of monetary policy communicated by the 
Fed. Moreover, demand, from both 
domestic and foreign investors, for long -
term government bon ds which were  
used as benchmark bonds continued to 
increase. This partly reflected expectations 
that overall  Thai government bond yields 
would likely decline. In addition, this 
was a result of an increase in the 
weights of Thai  bonds in JP Morgan’s 
benchm ark index.

            Monetary Policy Report June  2019  18 Overall corporate bond yields  
declined in the second quarter of 2019 in 
tandem  with government bond yields and 
credit spread.8/ Cost of financing through 
commercial banks  remained at a low level , 
as represented in the  new loan rate (NLR)9/ 
in April 2019 that remained stable at 4.1 
percent from the end of the previous quarter 
(Chart 2.8). Meanwhile, reference loan 
rates of commercial banks remained  mostly 
unchanged from the previous quarter , with 
the exception of a slight increase in one 
medium-sized bank‘s minimum retail rate 
(MRR) in May.  
Accommodative financial conditions allowed  business financing to continue .  
Private credit10/ moderated in the 
first quarter and April 2019 . In April, private 
credit expanded 4. 9 percent (Chart 2.9) 
due to a slowdown of business credit, 
especially in the manufacturing sector. 
This was partly owing to a partial loan 
repayment by large corporates from funds 
obtained through corporate bond 
financing. On the other hand, credit 
extended to households continued  to grow 
in all loan types in line with robust 
expansion of private consumption. In 
particular, mortgage loan extension 
accelerated prior to the implementation of 
the revised loan -to-value (LTV) ratio 
measures in April.  
The n et issuance of corporate bonds  continued to increase from the previous quarter in 
the first quarter of 2019 , driven by corporate financing of several businesses including businesses 
in food and beverage s, and the IT and telecommunication sectors. This was reflected in net

each month. The loan contracts exclude consumer loans, credit card loans, repurchase agreements, bank 
guarantees, as well as loans extended to financial intermediaries, the public sector and non -residents. The 
dataset covers loans wit h value of 20 million baht or higher for all loan types, purposes and maturities, and 
includes both secured and unsecured loans. Moreover, interest rates used in the calculation refer to the mid -rate 
between the lowest and the highest rates in each loan co ntract.

percent (Chart 2.10). Funding through 
the equity market  continued to increase  for 
businesses related to transport and logistics, 
and steel production, as well as  funding for 
merger and acquisition in the insurance 
sector.  
 Going forward, financial conditions  
were expected to remain accommodative . 
This was reflected in the  real policy interest 
rate that remained accommodative and 
moderate compared to other countries (Chart 
2.11) , despite increasing somewhat due to 
lower infla tion expectations . Meanwhile , 
costs of business financing through 
commercial banks, as represented by the 
new loan rate (NLR), remained stable at a 
low level. However, financial institutions 
were expected to tighten credit standards in 
the second quarter of 201911/, particularly for 
loans extended to large corporate s and 
mortgage loans  due to  concerns over 
borrowers’  credit quality and outlook of the 
real estate market.  
The baht appreciated against the U.S. 
dollar  and the nominal effective exchange 
rate (NEER) index also appreciated.   
In the second quarter of 2019, the baht appreciated against the U.S. dollar  relative to 
the end of the previous quarter (Chart 2.12). In April, the baht depreciated against the U.S. dollar 
which strengthened following better -than-expected U.S. economic data outturns and increased 
market concerns over the European economic outlook  as economic data outturns  continued to 
turn out lower than market expected . In addition, f oreign investors reduced their holdings of EM 
assets, particularly assets of net oil importing countries , following an increase in global crude oil 
prices. However, the baht strengthened against the U.S. dollar  again in early May , as risks in 
the global financial market  heightened  on the back of intensified trade tensions . This  led to an 
appreciation of safe -haven currencies, particularly the yen and the baht. Additio nally, capital 
flows returned to EMs following a more dovish stance of monetary policy communicated by the 
Fed and the ECB, a greater clarity on political developments in Thailand, as well as  an increase  
in the  weights of Thai equities and bonds in the MSC I and JP Morgan ind ices which  induced 
foreign investors to increase holdings of Thai financial securities (Chart 2.13). Consequently , on 
25 June 2019, the baht closed at 30.74 per U.S. dollar, up 3.3 percent from the end of the 
previous quarter.

an appreciation of  3.0 percent from the end of the previous quarter. The movement was in line 
with the baht appreciation against most currencies of Thailand’s trading partners, with the 
exception of the yen. As the end of May 2019 , the preliminary real effective exchange rate

net inflowsMonetary Policy Report June  2019  21 There remained p ockets of risks in the Thai financial system that could pose vulnerabilities to 
financial stability in the future. These risks included: ( 1) an accumulation of household debt 
and debt serviceability of some household groups and small enterprises ( 2) search -for-yield 
behavior, particularly of saving cooperatives and large corporates, and ( 3) risks in the real 
estate sector.   
 Thailand’s financial stability remained sound overall, particularly with regard to external 
stability, as indicated by the country’s high level of international reserves and sustained current 
account surpluses, while the external debt to GDP ratio remained  low. These factors combined to 
cushion the Thai economy against volatilities in global financial markets. Financial institutions 
maintained robust financial positions, as reflected in high levels of capital buffers to cushion 
against risks stemming from d eterioration in credit  quality. Nevertheless, there remained pockets 
of risks that warranted monitoring going forward. Such risks were  as follows :  
1. Leveraged household debt continued,  while debt serviceability of some household 
groups and small enterpri ses continued to deteriorate.  The ratio of household debt to GDP rose 
from the pervious quarter to 78.6 percent at the end of the fourth quarter of 2018 ( Chart 2.14) . 
Household debt was expected to continue rising due to the following factors:  (1) a contin ued 
acceleration of auto loans by both commercial banks and leasing companies  since the second 
quarter of 2017 , as a result of sales promotions and more lenient credit standards  on auto loans in 
the previous periods , and ( 2) the uptrend in mortgage loan s prior to the implementation of the revised 
LTV ratio measures.  This was observed in the expansion of  new mortgage loans by financial 
institutions of  28.1 percent from the same period last year  in the first quarter of 2019 , an acceleration 
from the fourth quarter of 2018. Nevertheless,  effect s of such measures on debt accumulation 
behavior must be monitored  going forward . However, persistently  low interest rates induced 
households to incur new debts, which could weigh on future consumption a nd debt serviceability, 
and result in limited households’ cushion against economic volatilities.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Overall credit quality remained stable, as indicated by the NPL ratio of commercial banks 
in the first quarter of 2019 which was stable at 2.9 percent relati ve to the previous quarter. 
However, debt serviceability of some loan types continued to deteriorate, particularly mortgage 
and auto loans whose NPL new -entry rates continued to trend up. Financial positions of some

These were reflected in operating profit margins (OPM) and sustained negative interest 
coverage ratio (ICR) of some small companies . 12/ As a result, the NPL ratio of commercial 
banks’ SME loan portfol ios remained high at 4.6 percent in the first quarter of 2019 . 
2. The continued search -for-yield 
behavior  under the environment of 
persistently low interest rates could lead 
to underpricing of risks.  Issues that 
warranted monitoring included, first, a 
continued search -for-higher -yield behavior 
of saving cooperatives, despite slower 
expansion in their assets and deposits 
relative to the previous periods (Chart 2.15).  
Systemic risk in the saving coopera tives 
system, both credit risk and liquidity risk, 
heightened from increased borrowings 
among saving cooperatives, especially if 
borrowers failed to repay loans. Second, 
some large corporates having significant 
connectedness with the financial system incre asingly raised funds given a prolonged period 
of low interest rates. This was particularly done through the bond market, including perpetual 
bonds, which could lead investors on these instruments to underprice risks. Nevertheless, 
those corporates with hig h debts were in utilities and manufacturing sectors. Many of these 
businesses increasingl y expanded foreign investments, particularly holding companies. The 
business structures of such businesses had become increasingly complicated, resulting in more 
difficult risk  assessment and possibly underpricing of risks. Third, expansion of offshore 
investment through foreign investment funds (FIF) resumed growth since the beginning of this 
year, particularly FIFs that invested in debt instruments and foreign currenc y deposits. 
Concentration risks still warranted monitoring as FIF investments  remained concentrated in 
only five major countries.   
3. Risks in the real estate sector  such as a decline in foreign demand , which might 
continue  in response to  a slowing outlook  of the global economy . This was reflected in a 16.3 percent 
fall in the value of foreign fund s transfer red for condominium purchase in the first quarter of 2019  
relative to the same period last year (Chart 2.16) , which could lengthen time  to sell existing excess 
supply. Nevertheless, r isks in the real estate sector were partly  addressed through  the revised  
LTV ratio measures. This was observed in d evelopers’ adjustments  by offering sales promotion s for 
completed projects and delaying new project launches , and a largely stable housing price index after 
having continuously increased in the previous periods . In addition, financial institutions would be 
more cautious in expanding mortgage loans, as signs of moderation in speculative activities  were 
observed as represented by a contraction in the number of loans for second and subsequent 
residential units  acquired by the same purchasers . However, the increase in new loan approvals for 
low-rise houses and condominium purchases indicated accelerat ion in ownership transfers prior to 
the implementation  of the revised LTV ratio measures  (Chart 2.17). Nevertheless, t here remained a

At the present time , global climate variability  increases in intensity and recurrence . 
This is reflected by recurring  phenomena of  El Niño (drought) and La Niña (flood). Land surface 
temperature also rose continually  and accelerated over the past decade . In particular,  global 
temperature hit record highs for 4 consecutive years  during 2015 -2018. In  2018 , global temperature 
was re corded as the fourth warmest year since global temperature records began in 1880. Such 
climate variability  poses adverse impact on global agricultural sectors,  including Thailand, 
which rely heavily on the clima te.  
 Over the recent years, intensified climate variability  considerably devastated 
Thailand’s agricultural output . The great flood in late 2011 destroyed in -season rice production  in 
the central region’s  plain. Severe and persistent droughts during 2015 -2016 , regarded as  the most 
severe drought crisis in the past 20 years , caused a contraction in  Thailand’s agricultural output  in 
2015  such as rice, fruits, and oil palm . This was the most severe damage to crop production in a 
decade. Meanwhile, crop prices also dropped, causing farm income to fall in 2015. These events 
demonstrated that more intensive climate variability poses direct impact on agricultural output and 
farm income. Hence, climate conditions analysis is important for assessing the situation of 
Thailand’s agricultural sector.   
1. Assessment of the current climate  conditions  
 The following are two important  indicators for assessing and monitoring climate  condit ions.  
1.1 Oceanic Ni ño Index (ONI)  - The ONI is an indicator of the probability of El Niño and La 
Niña phenomena . Currently, the index  indicates weak El Ni ño conditions as the index has been 
positive in the range of 0.5-0.9 for five  consecutive  months  (Chart 1). Moreover , there is almost 60 
percent probability  of weak El Niño persist ing until early  2020  (Chart 2). Although the current El 
Niño is less  severe compared to the past events in  2015 -2016 , uncertainties remain high in the 
period ahead .

 1.2  Indica tors of Thailand’s regional climate  (1) Reservoir water levels and accumulated 
precipitation.  Currently, the reservoir water levels reflected small impacts despite some signs of 
drought from delayed rainfall (Chart 3). (2) Precipitation in the dry season (November – April) had 
been close to the normal level (Chart 4). However, the Northeast is more vulnerable to drought 
than other regions  as remaining water levels account for only one -third of reservoirs’ capacity. 
Moreover, accumulated precipitation in dry season  was below the normal level and the level in 2016, 
the year with a severe drought.  In addition, since the size of most reservoirs in the Northeast are 
small, irrigated area accounts for only 11 percent of to tal area, which is the lowest among the regions  
(Chart 5).

 Going forward, although  Thailand officially entered  the wet season  since late May, weak El 
Niño conditions  will likely persist for some time , leading to below -average precipitation . Water 
levels in reservoirs are also lower than the previous year. Hence, there are high risks that the production 
of major crops cultivated during the wet season will be impinged.   
2. Impact  on agricultural output  
Due to  risks of  climate uncertainties from May to October , which are the cultivating months 
for in -season rice as Thailand’s major crop output , this article aims to assess the impact of 
climate on the in -season rice output in 2019 . An econometric model is employed ( 1) to estimate 
output per rai given climate -related factors such  as temperature, accumulat ed precipitation , dry 
season’s reservoir  discharge  and cultivation area, as well as  (2) to estimate harvest area  using 
historical data.

and 2016Monetary Policy Report June  2019  27 The study reveals that under normal climate  conditions, in-season  rice output will expand by 
6.5 percent. However , if drought extend  only across the Northeast (Scenario 1), in-season rice 
output w ill expand by only 1.7 percent . This will be due to slower  growth in the harvest  area and 
the fall in  output per rai following drought in some areas . In case of more severe  drought in the 
Northeast (Scenario 2) or of its spillover to the  North ern and Central regions  (Scenario 3), 
output w ill contract by 3.3 and 5.5 percent,  respectively . This will be owing to falls in both output 
per rai and harvest  area. Nevertheless, th e case  study only illustrates drought impact  on  
in-season  rice. It does not consider impact on other crops, such as off-season  rice and sugarcane, 
which may also be affected  if drought  expanded further  (Chart 6).  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Severe droughts will devastate agricultural output significantly. More intensifying climate 
variability including droughts and floods, as well as other types of risks such as plant and animal 
diseases, will pose direct impact on the well -being of farmers, who are one of t he vulnerable groups 
with low income and high debt burden. Thus, the government needs to formulate long -term 
resolution to tackle the problem through efficient water management together with 
appropriate and sufficient water allocation for consumption and c ultivation.  In addition, the 
government  needs to stand ready to handle such situation, to reduce risks for farmers who are the 
main affected party . This would promote their resilience against  intensifying and recurring climate 
variability.

Under the Committee’s assessment, the Thai economy was expected to expand 
at a slower rate of 3.3 and 3.7 percent in 2019 and 2020, respectively, lower than  the 
projection of 3.8 and 3.9 in the previous Monetary Policy Report  (Table 2.2). The downward 
revision was mainly due to external demand, where growth of merchandise and services exports 
was projected to be lower than the previous assessment following a slowdown of trading partner 
economies and global trade volume. Moreov er, private consumption and investment were 
expected to moderate from the previous year as merchandise export s contracted and 
confidence on future  economic expansion somewhat  declined . Public spending would continue 
to support economic growth  in the period  ahead  albeit at a lesser extent than previously 
assessed , due to a n expected  delay  in the  enactment of the Annual Budget Expenditure Act, 
B.E. 2563 (A.D. 2020). The projection for headline inflation was in line with the previous 
assessment . Energy prices that were projected  to be higher than expected would help offset  
lower -than-expected fresh food prices and core inflation. The latter was partly a result of  
demand -pull inflationary pressures that would likely decline in tandem with a softening economic 
growth outlook . 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
Summary of the key forecast assumptions  
 Trading partner economies  were projected to slow down throughout the forecast horizon due to  
(1) lower -than-expected growth outturns in the first quarter of 2019, particularly Asian economies, (2) 
slower -than-expected growth in several  economies as reflected by economic indicators in the second 
quarter of 2019, and (3) uncertainties surrounding gl obal trade outlook which affected production and 
investment in advanced economies and subsequently in regional countries . 
  The federal funds rate was projected to be lower than the previous assessment, consistent with  
a more dovish stance of the Fed’s m onetary policy communication in order to cope with uncertainties 
pertaining to a softening outlook of the global economy . The Fed was expected to  cut the policy rate 
once in the second half of 2019 with an additional cut in 2020, compared with the previous assessment 
of one policy rate hike in the second half of 2019 , and maintaining the rate throughout 2020.  
  Asian currencies (excluding the Chin ese yuan)  were expected to depreciate throughout the forecast 
horizon due to weaker -than-assessed  outturns during the second quarter of 2019. In the period ahead, 
regional currencies would gradually and slowly appreciate , mainly on account of the outlook o f the U.S. 
policy rate which would likely be more dovish.

to moderating demand for crude oil amid the global economic slowdown. However, tightening crude 
oil supply , due to a production cut according to the OPEC arrangement , was expected to support oil 
prices in the short term.  
  Farm income was projected to expand at a faster pace than previously assessed on account of higher 
agricultural prices. T his was particularly the case for rubber whose prices rose as global supply 
declined. Moreover, farm income was expected to further benefit from additional government 
measures through a budget increase in the project that aimed to help farmers grow other c rops after 
rice cultivation.  
  Public spending at current prices were revised downward throughout the forecast horizon , mainly due 
to public investment following the the delayed enactment of the Annu al Budget Expenditure Act, B.E. 
2563 (A.D. 2020). Moreover, infrastructure investment projects by some state -owned enterprises were 
postponed due to problems in accessing construction sites and changes in construction plans. 
Meanwhile, public consumption was expected to moderate slightly  due to decelerating trend of personnel  
compensation expenditure.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The value of merchandise exports in 2019 would remain broadly unchanged from the previous 
year as a result of the slowdown in global economy  and global trade volume.  
The value of merchandise exports in 2019  was expected to remain broadly unchanged 
from the previous year due to the impact from intensifying trade tensions and China’s retaliatory 
measures , which could expand  to non -tariff barriers (NTBs). Volume of Thai merchandise  exports 
would be affected through following  channels: (1) the deceleration of global trade volume,  
as reflected by the slowdown in the World Trade Outlook Indicator (WTOI) 13/ in the second quarter 
of 2019, and (2) a slowdown of external demand, as shown by a continued contraction  in 
merchandise exports to China and several key trading partners in the recent period. Meanwhile, 
the benefits from redirected order s from China to Thailand could only part ially offset a potential 
decline  in exports (Chart 2.18 a nd 2.19). However, merchandise exports in the period ahead would

Source: Customs Department, calculations by Bank of ThailandMonetary Policy Report June  2019  31 Exports of services were projected to decelerate amid the global economic slowdown.  
Exports of services were projected to exhibit a slower growth than previously 
assessed due to a decreased number of foreign tourists and lower spending per head .  
In particular, foreign tourist figures and lower spending per trip declin ed during the first half of 
2019 , partly due to the global economic slowdown (Chart 2.20). However, government 
measure s to promote  tourism through  the extended exemption of visa -on-arrival (VOA) fees 
until the end of October 2019 and a greater tourism prom otion by both government and  
the private sector might partly help offset the impact. Therefore, the projected number of foreign 
tourists was revised down to 39.9 and 41.3 million  in 2019 and 2020, respectively, lower than 
the previous projections of  40.4 and 42.0 million in the previous Monetary Policy Report .  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The current account was projected to record 29.1 and 26.3 billion U.S. dollars 
surplus in 2019 and 2020, respectively. The estimate s were  revised down from the previous 
Monetary Policy Report  due to a decline in the value of both merchandise and services exports. 14/   
Private consumption in 2019 was expected to moderate compared to the high growth last year,  
but would continue to expand.  
Private consumption was projected to continue expanding across  all product  
categories . Supporting factors included sales promotion continuously offered by businesses, 
rising farm household  income  mainly due to positive development of rubber price s, as well  as 
government measures which partly helped support household consumption , such as 
government measures to boost spending  through tax deduction  and an increase in government 
transfers to support low -income earners through  the social  welfare card. Nonetheles s,  
private consumption in the period ahead would be restrained by non -farm household income 
given signs of moderation in earnings, especially in export -related manufacturing sector.

institutions would have to place greater emphasis on debt serviceability of borrowers. Moreover, 
consumer confidence among low -income households declined  as elevated household debt 
pressure d households to allocate part of their income for debt repayment.  
Private investment was expected to continue expending despite at a lower rate than the 
previous assessment.  
Private investment was expected to continue expending although the growth 
projection for 2019 was revised down from the previous est imate . This was due to a softer 
outlook of exports and a decline in investment confidence of businesses  in the period ahead driven 
by the impact from trade protectionist measures. This was reflected in a postponement in investment 
of businesses, both investment for production efficiency improvement and capacity expansion.  
In 2020, private investment was expected to exhibit a higher -than-expected growth due t o a greater 
clarity of some mega -investment projects , including the third phase of the Mabtapud Industrial Port 
and 5G technology -related infrastructure investment. Going forward , private investment would likely 
benefit from additional relocation of produc tion base to Thailand, particularly Chinese industries 
affected by trade protectionist measures, and progress on infrastructure development in the Eastern 
Economic Corridor (EEC). The latter would attract greater private investment as reflected by  
the inc reasing  number of investment promotion applications submitted to the Board of Investment 
(BOI) for investment projects within the EEC area.  
Public spending was projected to support economic growth at a lesser extent than 
previousl y assessed .  
Public spendi ng was expected to register lower -than -expected growth .  
Public  investment was revised downward for investment by the central government , due to  
an expected  delayed in the enactment of the Annual Budget Expenditure Act, B.E. 2563  
(A.D. 2020) as a result of a longer -than-usual period to form the new government. Also,  some  
investment projects by state -owned enterprises w ere postponed due to contract reviews for  
the speed rail project between  Bangkok  and Nakhon Ratchasima, and problems in accessing 
contruction sites and changes in construction plans for the Purple Line mass rapid transit 
between Tao Poon -Rat Burana and the Missing Link  along the Red Line.15/ Meanwhile,  
public consumption was expected to slightly moderate due to decelerating trend of personnel 
compensation expenditure.  
Projections of headline inflation were in line with the previous assessment. Core inflation was 
forecast ed to be slightly lower than the previous estimate but would gradually  trend up .  
Headline inflation projection was  expected to be in line with the previous 
projection in  the previous Monetary Policy Report . Core inflation and fresh food prices were 
expected to be lower than previously anticipated due to lower -than-expected data outturns , and 
declining demand -pull infla tionary pressures in the period ahead due to a softening economic  
growth outlook , as shown by the flattening output gap throughout the forecast horizon compared 
to the previous estimate (Chart 2.21). However, energy prices were projected to be higher  than 
expected, especially in 2019 , following higher -than-expected outturns of domestic retail oil

delaying the assumption on a lower 
contribution to the energy fund to the third 
quarter of 2019, from previously anticipating  
a lower contribution in April . Meanwhile , 
core inflation in 2020 was projected to 
gradually rise in line with the outlook of 
domestic demand. Thus, the Committee 
projected headline inflation to average 
1.0 percent in 2019 and 2020 , and core 
inflation to average 0.7 and 0.9 percent 
in 2019 and 202 0, respectively.  
Growth and inflation projections were still subject to downside risks.  
Under the Committee’s assessment, growth and inflation projections were subject 
to downside risks, as reflected in the fan chart that tilted downward (Chart 2.22) , despite, 
upside risks from additional government stimulus measures to support private spending . 
Possibilities that the Thai  economy would under perform the baseline projection  included 
(1) a larger -than-expected slowdown in global trade volume  and impact on Thai merchandise 
exports in the case of intensif ied trade protectionist measures , (2) lower -than-expected trading 
parter economic growth, particularly in the event  of no -deal Brexit, and due to consequences of 
Chinese economic and financial stability problems,  and geopolitical risks, (3) a delay  in the new 
government formation which could impact the continuation of government budget disbursement 
and policy implementation, and (4) a low er-than-expected growth of Chinese tourist figures if 
the Chinese government were to promote domestic tourism. However, there were possibilities 
that the Thai economy would outperform the baseline projection owing to  (1) higher -than-
expected growth of Thai land’s trading partner economies, should there be additional 
government stimulus measures or better -than-expected improvements on trade tensions, and 
(2) higher -than-expected domestic demand as a result of (2.1) a sooner -than-expected 
implementation of gov ernment infrastructure investment projects, PPP projects and private 
investment, and (2.2) a larger -than-expected contribution from government stimulus measures 
if the new government could accelerate disbursements or release additional measures to 
stimulat e private spending. Meanwhile, risks to the forecasts of headline and core inflation 
were expected to tilt downward in line with risks  to growth projections and assumptions on 
global crude oil price (Chart 2.23 and Chart 2.24).

( ) Monetary Policy Report March 2019Annual percentage changeMonetary Policy Report June  2019  35 3. Monetary Policy Decision  
 
The Committee assessed that the Thai economy would  expand  at a slower pace  than 
previously assessed amid external and internal  uncertainties in the period ahead. 
Accommodative monetary policy thus remained appro priate for fostering sustainable 
economic growth while preserving price stability. Meanwhile, safeguarding  financial stability 
would remain necessary and could be done  a combination of  tools.  
The Committee weighed various factors in determining the most appropriate course of 
monetary policy, placing great emphasis on the strength and continuation of economic growth, 
development of headline inflation, and preserving financial stability. Details on the assessment 
of latest developments and outlook are as fo llows.  
1. Economic growth The Thai economy was expected to expand at a slower pace  than 
the previous assessment due to merchandise exports  outlook which exhibited significantly 
lower -than-expected growth . This was owing to trading partner economies ’ and gl obal trade 
slowdown following intensified trade tensions. Moreover, exports  of services were expected to 
moderate, especially tourist figures and Chinese tourists ’ spending per head. With regard to 
domestic demand, private consumption was projected to continue expanding, but would be 
pressured by the purchasing power of non -farm households, particularly those in export -related 
manufacturing sector s, as well as by elevated household debt. Meanwhile, private investment 
would like ly grow at a lower rate tha n the previous assessment, as some investors delayed their 
investment in response to softer exports outlook and lower invest ment  confidence. However, 
private investment in 2020 was expected to continue expanding  thanks to  the relocation of 
production base to Thailand  due to the impact of  trade protectionist measures , as well as  
progress in the EEC investment projects . Public expenditure would help drive the economy to a 
lesser extent than previously assessed due to an expected delay in the enactment of the 2020 
Annual Budget Expenditure Act as well as the postponement of some state -owned enterprise 
investment. The Committee assessed that there remained risks  of the Thai economy 
underperform ing baseline projection due to (1) potentially intensifying  trade tensions , which  
could affect domestic demand, as well as (2) the ability of the government to advance  important 
policies and maintain the continuity of public spending.  
2. Preserving financial stability The Committee assessed that there remained ce rtain 
pockets of risks that might pose vulnerabilities to financial stability in the future. Such risks 
included (1) high and rising household leverage , particularly auto leasing and mortgage 
loans. Credit quality of auto leasing  loans  continued to deterio rate, partly due to  more lenient  
credit underwriting standards over the previous periods . This was partly a result of heightened  
competition from increasing participation  of non -bank financial institutions. Also, farm income 
and household  income  in the provinces decelerated significantly in recent period s. Meanwhile, 
credit quality of SMEs was similarly  expected to deteriorate, especially in the trading sector 
where the new-entry NPL  rate remained  high. In addition, a prolonged low interest rate 
environment  induced households to create new debt, which could weigh on consumption and 
affect debt serviceability in the future. (2) The continued s earch -for-yield behavior given a 
prolonged low interest rate environment  could lead to underpricing of risks. For example, 
saving co operatives continued to search for higher returns as reflected in the high growth of Monetary Policy Report June  2019  36 their assets and deposits, although somewhat decelerated. In addition , large corporates  
continued to raise funds given a prolonged low interest rate environm ent. These corporates  had 
high interconnectedness  in the financial system , especially through bond issuances . (3) Risks 
in the real estate sector  remained , including an oversupply of condominium s in certain areas 
due to likely declines in the foreign demand for Thai condominium s from global econom ic 
slowdown . Nevertheless, there was an acceleration in ownership transfers before the 
implementation of the revised LTV measures as reflected by increase d new loan  approvals for 
both low -rise houses and condo minium s. Meanwhile, real estate developers adjusted by 
launching sale promotions on finished projects and delayed lau nching new projects. However, 
there was a need to closely monitor adjustments in the real estate market and in mortgage  loans  
after the revised LTV  measures ’ effective  date in April 2019.  
3. Inflation development Headline inflation would be largely unchanged from the 
previous projection. Core inflation and fresh food prices would likely decline in line with  data 
outturns and moderating demand -pull inflationary pressures. This was reflected by various 
indicators including trimmed mean and principal component indicators. (Chart 3.1) Moreover , 
structural changes such as intensified price competition and cost -reduction technology partly 
caused inf lation to rise at a slower pace than in the past. Nevertheless , rising energy prices 
would help offset possible decline s in core inflation and fresh food prices. Meanwhile,  
short -term inflation expectations  (1-year ahead) were largely unchanged from the p revious 
quarter. (Chart 3.2)

There remained a need to employ a combination of  tools to reduce  financial stability risks in 
the period ahead.  
The Committee discussed measures to address and prevent financial stability  risks. The 
Committee  viewed that safeguarding financial stability in the period ahead would remain 
necessary and could be done through a combination of tools, including the appropriate policy 
interest rate, macroprudential measures, and microprudential me asures. This was because the 
sole use of macroprudential and microprudential measures in recent period s could only address 
certain risks. Therefore, the Committee deemed it necessary to continue monitor ing the impacts 
of the implemented macroprudential mea sures. Regarding the current context of monetary 
policy, more emphasis was placed on preserving financial stability. The Committee discussed a 
framework for incorporating financial stability consideration in monetary policy formulation in a 
more systematic  manner. The Committed develop ed comprehensive financial stability 
indicators, including a financial cycle indicator that was related to downside risks of economic 
growth, in order to analyze  basic tradeoffs between macroeconomic and financial stability 
objectives . Moreover , the Committee viewed that an appropriate mix of monetary policy tools 
was still necessary in the period ahead to curb financial stability . In conjunction with  that, a further 
examination of additional measures  was required  to prevent sy stemic risks more effectively.  
The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 1.75% in order to foster  
accommodative  financial conditions. This would foster a continuation of  economic growth 
and was appropriate given the inflation target, while also not  posing vulnerabilit ies to 
financial stability.  
The Committee voted unanimously to keep the policy unchanged at 1.75% at the 
meetings on 8 May and 26 June 2019. The Committee viewed that the current accommodative 
monetary policy stance contr ibuted to the continuation of economic growth and was appropriate 
given the inflation target. Moreover, against the backdrop of heightened uncertainties 
surrounding global economic condition s and domestic factors, the Committee thus deemed it 
appropriate t o keep the policy rate unchanged. However, the Committee expressed concerns

fundamentals  and could negatively affect economic growth going forward.  Given moderating 
economic prospects,  current economic data from various sectors reflected that the Thai 
economy would be more  sensitive to currency appreciation. The labor market showed clearer  
signs of vulnerabilities,  especially in the export -related manufacturing and to urism sector s. 
Therefore, developments of exchange rates, capital flows, as  well as impacts on the economy 
through various channels  warranted close monitor ing. Along with that, it was necessary to 
prepare short -term capital inflow management  measures ready  to be implemented at an 
appropriate time, as well as to continue relaxing  more capital outflow regulations to encourage 
a greater flow of outward portfolio investment  by residents.  In the period ahead, there remained 
a need to address financial stability risks through a combination of tools, including the appropriate 
policy rate as well as microprudential and macroprudential measures which would need to place 
greater emphasis on debt  serviceability of borrowers. In addition, t he Committee deemed it 
necessary to examine further appropriate macroprudential measures to prevent systemic risks 
more effectively.  
Looking ahead, there remained high uncertainties from both external and interna l 
factors. The current accommodative monetary policy would, therefore, remain appropriate. 
However, the Committee would closely monitor developments of the outlook for growth, inflation, 
financial stability, and exchange rate, together with associated risk s, especially impacts of trade 
tensions , in deliberating appropriate monetary policy in the period ahead.

Global Economy   
Major advanced economies were expected to grow at a slower rate, mainly on account of 
exports and private investment that were affected by the trade protectionist measures 
between the U.S. and China, despite higher -than-expected economic data outturns of several 
economies in the first quarter of 2019. However, robust labor market and government stimulus 
measures in many countries would be supporting factors for growth of Thailand’s trading 
partner economies in the period ahead.

The Thai economy expanded at a slower pace, as merchandise exports were mainly affected 
by a slowdown of trading partner economies and trade protectionist measures.  However, 
domestic demand continued to support growth, as private consumption and investment 
continued to expand.  Meanwhile, government expenditure expanded on account of  both public 
consumption and investment.

First quarterMonetary Policy Report June  2019  45 Inflation  
Headline inflation edged up, particularly in the fresh food category. Meanwhile, core inflation 
declined slightly mainly in line with core inflation in the food category. Nevertheless, prices of 
most goods and services slowly increased despite growing dome stic demand, since structural 
changes led to a moderate increase in core inflation in the non -food categories in the recent 
periods.

bond yields gradually rose. Meanwhile, medium - and long -term government bond yields 
declined in line with the U.S. government bond yields. Since the end of the previous  quarter, 
the baht appreciated against the U.S. dollar, following a more dovish stance of monetary policy 
communicated by the Fed and a greater clarity pertaining to political developments  
in Thailand, which induced foreign investors to increase holdings of Thai securities. Financial 
conditions remained accommodative , which allowed corporate financing to continue .

First quarterMonetary Policy Report June  2019  48 Stability: corporate sector  
Large corporates maintained their high profitability. Meanwhile, debt serviceability of SMEs 
would need to be monitored, particularly small businesses in certain sectors with vulnerable 
financial positions. This was reflected by the operating profit margin and interest coverage ratio 
of some sm all businesses that remained negative. The NPL ratio among SMEs stood at 4.6 
percent, above the historical average .

 . Monetary Policy Report June  2019  49 Stability: real estate  
Foreign demand in the real estate market  continued to decrease in response to the global 
economic slowdown, which could lengthen time to sell existing excess supply.  In addition,  
the acceleration in residential ownership transfers, and a delay  in new project launches by 
developers, could be obs erved prior to the implementation of the revised LTV ratio measures . 
Meanwhile, housing price index  remained largely stable .
