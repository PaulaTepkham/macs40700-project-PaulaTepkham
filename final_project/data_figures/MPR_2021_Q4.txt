1. Executive Summary 7
Data in this report is as of 21 December 2021 (1 day prior to the Monetary Policy Meeting) 1. Executive SummaryExecutive Summary 
At the meetings on November 10 and December 
22, 2021, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) 
voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 
0.50 percent. The Committee assessed that the Thai 
economy had bottomed out in the third quarter of 2021 
and would continue to recover. However, the Omicron 
outbreak was a key risk to the growth outlook and 
must be closely monitored. 
The MPC continued to put emphasis on supporting 
the economic recovery in deliberating policy decision . 
The Committee viewed that continued accommodative
monetary policy would support economic growth and
decided to keep the policy rate unchanged. 
Headline inflation would rise temporarily due to 
supply -side factors which would likely be resolved in 
2022. There  was a low likelihood that inflationary 
pressure would continue to mount due to limited 
ability of businesses to pass on higher costs to 
customers as well as fragile labor market conditions. 
Nevertheless, it was deemed necessary to closely 
monitor inflation developments given the rapid 
increase in inflation rates globally . Global Economy
•Trading partner economies would continue to grow albeit at a slower pace. Growth rate in 2021 was expected to be lower than previously 
assessed due to the COVID -19 Delta outbreak in the third quarter of 2021 and prolonged supply disruption. For 2022, trading part ners’ growth would 
slow down due to the outbreaks at the beginning of the year which is during winter in the northern hemisphere, as well as the Omicron outbreak. 
Nevertheless, the impact would be limited to early 2022. For 2023, trading partners’ growth was expected to pick up as the pa ndemic and supply 
disruption resolve.  
•Many central banks have signaled less accommodative monetary policy stances, partly because inflation rates continue to rise above the target, 
and the economies continue to recover. Monetary Policy Conduct
in the Fourth Quarter of 2021Assessment of the Economic and Financial Outlook as the Basis for Policy Formulation
Financial Conditions and Financial Stability
•Overall financial conditions in Thailand remained accommodative. Businesses could still obtain financing although credit risks remained an 
financial obstacle for SMEs. On exchange rates, the baht against the U.S. dollar and the effective exchange rate depreciated from the previous 
quarter. The depreciation was due to (1) the Omicron outbreak which weighed on the recovery prospects of tourism sector and (2) major central 
banks adopting less accommodative monetary policy stances sooner than expected. 
•The Thai financial system remained vulnerable, especially as balance sheets of households and businesses were affected by several waves of 
COVID -19 outbreaks . Such vulnerability could derail economic growth in the period ahead. It was thus deemed necessary to closely monitor their 
development and prepare for medium -term risks that could arise in the future. The Thai Economy
•The Thai economy was projected to grow 0.9% in 2021, slightly revised up from the previous assessment due to better -than-expected outturns 
towards the end of the year. For 2022, the Thai economy was projected to grow 3.4%. The impacts of Omicron on domestic economic activities,
merchandise exports, and foreign tourist figures were assessed to be limited to early 2022. For 2023, the economy would pick up and register 
a growth of 4.7% driven mainly by the recovery in foreign tourist figures. 
•Headline inflation was projected to be within the target range throughout the forecast period. The forecasts for headline inf lation were 
revised up to 1.2% in 2021 and 1.7% in 2022 as energy prices would rise temporarily in tandem with global crude oil prices. Headline inflation 
was projected to be 1.4% in 2023.

+ Philippines(3.1%)In 2021, trading partners posted a strong economic recovery from the previous year but 
growth would be slower overall when compared to the previous forecast. This was due to the 
COVID -19 outbreak and the prolonged supply disruption posing a greater impact on 
consumption and production than previously expected.
Similarly, for 2022, it was expected that trading partners would continue to expand, albeit at a 
slower pace than previously assessed. This was attributed to the outbreak of COVID -19 during 
the beginning of the year which coincides with winter for countries in the northern hemisphere 
such as Europe and the U.S., as well as the outbreak of the Omicron variant. In addition, it was 
assessed that the impact of the outbreak would be limited to early 2022 and that the economy 
would gradually recover thereafter.
By 2023, trading partner economies were expected to continue expanding with economic 
growth returning to normal levels as the outbreak subsides and supply disruption is resolved. 
This would also result in a less divergent growth outlook between advanced economies and 
emerging market economies.
10Trading partner economies would continue to expand in the period ahead, albeit at a slower pace.  Global Economy
Overall, consumption picked up as containment measures were relaxed after the number of new COVID -19 cases declined. This was re flected by the 
increase in retail sales, especially among Asian economies. For G3 countries (U.S., Japan, and the euro area), the U.S. in particular, the pickup in re tail sales 
was attributed to front -loaded spending ahead of the holiday seasons to avoid delays caused by the ongoing supply disruption. However, the recovery 
remained fragile as reflected in the declining consumer confidence. This was in part due to concerns over another outbreak during the winter a s the euro 
area saw the rise in new COVID -19 cases after the re -opening, as well as concerns regarding the rising inflation. 
11Private consumption gradually recovered after the outbreak began to subside, but recovery remained fragile due to 
concerns of another wave of outbreak during the winter.

Manufacturing and exports in some countries would slow down due to the ongoing supply disruption being prolonged further. This was in part due to 
more stringent containment measures in several countries like China where its policy goal was to see zero new COVID -19 cases. At the same time, the shortage 
of freight containers and raw materials, especially electronic parts, was still an ongoing problem, while the demand for good s would also ramp up during the 
new year thus leading to longer delivery time.
The ongoing supply disruption was expected to gradually unwind from the second half of 2022 onwards after the pandemic subsid es and as economic 
activities gradually return to normal.

Source: PTT, Investing., World Bank, Energy and Metals Consensus forecast, calculations by BOTIn the fourth quarter of 2021, the global oil market tightened due to increased demand. This included increased demand for oil during the winter for 
electricity generation as a substitute for natural gas and coal whose prices were high, as well as increased demand from the gradual economic recovery. 
However, the U.S. and its partners releasing crude oil from their strategic petroleum reserves would likely help ease market conditions. In this regard, 
it was expected that the global oil market conditions would ease from the first quarter of 2022 onwards as increases in oil s upply surpass demand.

Source: CEICHeadline Inflation Inflation continued to pick up in advanced economies (AEs) , especially the U.S., driven by economic recovery and higher energy prices. Meanwhile, inflation in 
emerging market economies (EMs) was not as high overall. Some EMs are net energy importers and therefore saw higher inflation. Nevertheless, inflation in 
many EM Asia countries remained low due to government measures such as energy price controls in Indonesia and Singapore, redu cedenergy taxes in South 
Korea, and government price subsidies in the Philippines and Malaysia. 
The increase in energy prices that drove the recent increase in inflation was partly a result of temporary supply shortages. Notwithstanding, inflation remained on 
the rise globally partly due to the ongoing supply disruption.

On the whole, AE central banks would keep their policy rates low to support 
economic recovery which was still subjected to large degrees of uncertainty. However, 
rising inflation has pressured many central banks into signaling a tighter 
monetary policy stance. For instance, the Bank of England began raising its policy 
rate at the MPC Meeting in December 2021. 
Most central banks in Asia were also likely to keep their policy rates low to 
support the gradual economic recovery that has been underway after the pandemic 
started to subside. The Bank of Korea had its second policy rate hike in November 
2021 in response to rising inflation which exceeded the target. The decision was also 
underpinned by concerns over elevated household debt levels. Meanwhile, the 
People’s Bank of China reduced the Required Reserve Ratio (RRR) to shore up 
economic growth which had slowed down following the implementation of measures 
to cool down the Chinese property market, and to maintain overall growth 
momentum in 2022. 
Many EM central banks also hiked their policy rates. This was mostly the case for 
countries that faced mounting inflationary pressure such as Brazil, the Czech 
Republic, Russia, Colombia, Peru, Hungary, and Mexico. Changes in policy rate of central banks in H2/2021

Markets expected the 
Fed to hike the policy 
rate twice in H2/22The Federal Reserve (Fed) announced its plans to taper its asset purchases (QE 
tapering) in November 2021. An additional announcement in December 2021 
stated that the Fed would speed up the tapering process which would be 
completed by March 2022. The announcement was underpinned by a strong 
economic recovery, strong labor markets, and consistently high inflation. In addition, 
the December 2021 FOMC Statement also indicated that the Fed might start 
raising the policy rate in the first half of 2022, with two additional rate hikes in 
the second half of the year.
The European Central Bank (ECB) announced that it would gradually ease its 
quantitative easing operations . The ECB would reduce asset purchases under the 
Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) starting from the fourth quarter of 
2021 and would conclude in March 2022. Nevertheless, asset purchases under the 
Asset Purchase Programme would continue. The policy rate would likely remain low 
for the foreseeable future in order to support the economic recovery which was 
subjected to large degrees of uncertainty. 
16In the fourth quarter of 2021, the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank announced a tapering of their 
asset purchases given that the economic recovery was underway and inflation was above target. 3. The Thai EconomyThe Thai Economy

Foreign tourists 0.15 0.28 6.0 5.6 20.0•Foreign tourist figures in 2021 was revised up slightly on account of tourist 
confidence which turned out better than expected after the Thai government 
had permitted vaccinated foreign tourists from low -risk countries to enter 
Thailand without any quarantine requirements (Test & Go scheme) since 
November 2021. However, registration for Test & Go entry has been temporarily 
suspended since 21 December 2021. 
•Foreign tourist figures in 2022 was revised down especially for early 2022 due 
to the impacts of the Omicron outbreak on foreign tourist confidence, as well 
as the tightening of international travel restrictions during early 2022 in many 
countries including Thailand.
•For 2023, foreign tourist figures would continue to gradually recover and 
reach 20 million persons (half of the pre -COVID level) as tourist confidence 
improves in tandem with widespread vaccination globally and as the pandemic 
subsides. Another supporting factor is the return of Chinese tourists as the 
Chinese government would likely ease international travel restrictions in 2023. Million personsProjected foreign tourist arrival

Labor market conditions have not yet returned 
to the pre -COVID levels while vulnerabilities have 
accumulated over multiple waves of COVID -19 
outbreaks. In the third quarter of 2021, a number of 
unemployed and underemployed persons rose 
sharply by 2.1 million from the pre -COVID level (the 
third quarter of 2019). Long -term unemployment 
also increased which indicated risks of losing skills 
over the long term.  
After the government relaxed containment measures 
in late 2021, the labor market showed some signs of 
improvement, especially for consumer confidence 
among various professions and economic activities 
among the self -employed workers in non -farm 
sectors . However, the labor market overall would 
recover slowly as reflected by non -farm incomes 
in 2022 and 2023 which were projected to be 
lower than levels seen in 2019. Labor market indicators

27Thai labor market has not returned to the pre -pandemic levels after facing multiple waves of COVID -19 outbreaks 
and would take a long time to recover. The Thai Economy
Headline inflation in the first two months of the fourth quarter of 2021 
averaged 2.55%, increasing from 0.70% in the previous quarter. The increase 
was mainly attributed to energy prices as the effects of the government’s 
electricity bill subsidy measure, which helped lower costs of living, in the 
previous quarter have dissipated, as well as higher retail oil prices in tandem 
with global crude oil prices. Meanwhile, fresh food prices exhibited a smaller 
contraction than the previous quarter as the floods caused vegetable prices to rise.Headline inflation and the target range
Core inflation in the first two months of the fourth quarter of 2021 
averaged 0.25%, increasing from 0.14% in the previous quarter. The increase 
was attributed to higher prices of housing and furnishing after the effects of the 
government’s water bill subsidies in the previous quarter have dissipated, as 
well as higher prices of seasoning and condiments which rose in tandem with 
vegetable oil prices.
28Headline inflation in the fourth quarter of 2021 increased from the previous quarter mainly due to energy prices.

Key risks to the growth outlook
•The impacts of the Omicron outbreak could become more widespread, 
severe, and prolonged than in the baseline. More countries could 
impose international travel restrictions and keep them in place for longer 
than expected. Many countries including Thailand might also impose 
domestic containment measures more widely. 
•Household and business confidence could be dampened than previously
assessed given multiple waves of COVID -19 outbreaks and household 
debt overhang.
•Support from government measures could lack of continuity thus affecting
private consumption. Political uncertainty could also arise. 
•The supply disruption problem could be prolonged and weigh on 
manufacturing businesses and exporters. 
30The economic growth could underperform the baseline projections, especially in the first half of 2022 due to 
uncertainties surrounding the Omicron outbreak. This is reflected in the fan chart which is skewed to the downside.

•Businesses might pass on higher costs to consumers more than expected
if costs remain high for an extended period of time. 
•The supply disruption problem could be more prolonged than expected 
under the baseline scenario due to the Omicron outbreak. 
•Risks pertaining to Dubai crude oil prices as prices could turn out higher 
than the baseline as a result of geopolitical risks in major oil producing 
countries. On the other hand, prices could become lower than the baseline 
if the Omicron outbreak leads to a decline in global oil demand.

32Forecast assumptions (1/3) 
The Omicron outbreak will impact economic growth in early 2022.
➢The Omicron variant is more contagious than 
the Delta variant. Current vaccines would thus be 
rendered less effective but could partly help reduce 
the severity of the outbreak. 
➢Household and business confidence is temporarily
affected especially in early 2022.International travel 
restrictions•Many countries impose more restrictions oninternational travel,
especially forcountries withawidespread Omicron outbreak .Meanwhile ,
some countries close their borders andpermit only their citizens to
enter thecountry withquarantine requirement .

Projected Dubai crude oil pricesDubai crude oil prices forecast for 2021 was revised up on account of 
higher -than-expected price outturns.
•Oil demand during winter season (the fourth quarter of 2021 and the first 
quarter of 2022) is higher than expected due to the switch from natural gas 
to oil in electricity generation as the increase in gas prices had outpaced 
the increase in oil prices.
•Many countries have relaxed containment measures.
•An increase in OPEC’s oil output is less than expected because some 
countries such as Nigeria are unable to increase oil production as agreed 
due to limited investment capital and maintenance delays. 
Although the forecasts for oil prices in 2022 and 2023 were revised up 
from the previous assessment, oil prices in those two years would decline 
from current price levels.
• Oil output from OPEC and its allies, and the U.S. would increase.
• Oildemand would decline due to the Omicron outbreak. Many countries 
have already tightened containment measures. This would continue to 
weigh on economic activities until early 2022.U.S. dollar per barrel

The Thai Economy
•Trading partner economies’ growth was revised down on account of actual outturns in the 
third quarter of 2021 which pointed to a sharper slowdown than expected. In the period 
ahead, trading partners would be further impacted by new waves of COVID -19 outbreak, 
especially the Omicron variant. In addition, the China’s economy would be additionally 
pressured by the government’s hawkish stance on manufacturing activates that are not 
environmentally friendly as well as by problems in the real estate market. 
•The Federal Funds Rate would be raised three quarters earlier than previously assessed from 
the first quarter of 2023 to the second quarter of 2022, and there would be three rate hikes 
each year in 2022 and 2023 given rising inflationary pressure and strong economic recovery.
•Regional currencies (excluding the Chinese yuan) would depreciate throughout the forecast 
period in line with the Fed’s QE tapering and earlier policy rate hike. 
•Dubai crude oil prices would rise mainly in the fourth quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of 
2022 as the global oil market tightens from oil demand outpacing oil output during winter 
season. Meanwhile, OPEC+ countries are unable to ramp up production by a significant margin. 
•Farm income (excluding government support measures) was revised down for 2021 due to 
the flood which resulted in destroyed rice crops. For 2022, farm income would increase owing 
to higher tapioca and rubber prices which are driven by strong demand. 
•Public spending at current prices was revised down on account of lower -than-expected 
government consumption outturns and lower projected state -owned enterprise investment in 
tandem with the Fiscal Year 2022 Budget.  Annual percentage change 2020* 2021 2022 2023

•Products whose costs increased from baht

•Baht’s depreciation affects inflation mainly 
through higher retail oil pricesBaht depreciationGlobal energy prices
In Q4/2021, the oil market tightened due to increased demand during winter as electricity
generation substituted oil for switches from using the more expensive natural gas and coal 
to using oil instead, as well as the global economic recovery. However, the release of oil from
strategic petroleum reserves would help ease the oil market. After Q1/2022, oil market 
conditions would further ease as oil output increases.

Domestic energy prices
•In Q4/2021, domestic energy prices would likely be driven higher by retail fuel prices 
domestically, although price adjustment mechanisms of the oil fund would help 
offset the impact*. The diesel pricing ceiling of 30 baht per litre maintained by the oil 
fund and recent policy to reduce the mixture of biodiesel in diesel fuels would help 
keep diesel costs down and lessen the costs borne by the oil fund. 
•In 2022, domestic energy prices would increase slightly. 
oCooking gas price was expected to gradually rise in Q2 after having been pegged 
since early 2020.
oElectricity costs would increase in Q1/2022 and continue to gradually pace rise 
throughout the remainder of the year in tandem with rising prices of key inputs, 
especially natural gas which would likely remain stable at high levels in 2022. 
*Note: This is under the assumption that the Oil Fund is able to borrow an additional 30 billion baht  
as authorized by the Decree issued on 27 November 2021. 37Inflation would rise temporarily in tandem with higher global energy prices which were expected to subside after 
Q1/2022 while government measures to control domestic energy prices would help offset the impact.Special Issue 1: Inflation dynamics in Thailand and risks to the inflation outlook in 2022 and the medium -term(2/4)Cost passthrough is currently limited

Business closure / mergers allows businesses more control over prices due to less competition
Geopolitical Risks could lead to higher production costs as a result of relocating the production 
base or higher import tariffs.
The transition to a green economy could result in higher costs of production due to businesses 
adjusting their production process to be more environmentally friendly or higher oil prices as oil 
producers reduce investment. However, lower oil demand abroad could also result in a decline in oil 
prices and therefore this dynamic and its impact on oil price must be monitored going forward .Structural factors leading to downward inflationary pressure over the medium -term
Growing adoption ofe-commerce, especially during thepandemic, resulting inhigher level of
price competition among sellers andeasier price comparison forbuyers .
Consumer purchasing power remained softduetoelevated household debt andwidening
inequality from theK-shaped economic recovery .Longer -term unemployment alsoincreased post-

Monetary Policy Decision: Summary of Key Considerations
Monetary Policy
The MPC voted to maintain the 
policy rate at 0.5% to preserve 
accommodative financial 
conditions to support 
economic recoveryFinancial and fiscal measures
The coordination between 
financial and fiscal measures 
would support the economic 
recovery in 2022 which was still 
subject to large degrees of 
uncertaintyFinancial conditions
Financial conditions remained 
accommodative and businesses 
were still able to obtain financing . 
The baht depreciated due to 
concerns over the COVID -19 
situation and the shift in 
monetary policy stance for 
major central banks.Financial stability
Vulnerabilities in the financial 
sector remained, namely those 
pertaining to the balance sheets 
of households and businesses.
It was deemed necessary to 
prepare for medium -term risks 
that could arise in the future.  
41Monetary Policy Decision
The Thai economy would continue to recover on the back of domestic spending and tourism recovery. 
The outbreak of Omicron would impact the economy in early 2022 and is a key risk to the growth outlook in 
the period ahead depending on the severity of the outbreak and the strictness of containment measures. 
Inflation is expected to remain within the target range over the medium term. Headline inflation increased 
temporarily mainly from higher energy prices but there remains a need to closely monitor global inflation 
developments and cost pass -through of businesses. At the present, the likelihood that inflation would rise 
continuously is limited because (1) businesses have limited ability to pass on higher costs to consumers as 
economic recovery is still gradual and (2) employment and labor income remained fragile. 
Financial stability. Elevated debt levels among households and businesses could hinder future economic 
growth. It was deemed necessary to prepare for medium -term risks that could arise in the future. 
The MPC continues to place emphasis on economic recovery in deliberating policy decisions and would 
continue to monitor factors that could impact the economic outlook. These factors include developments 
pertaining to COVID -19, the adequacy of fiscal, financial and credit relief measures, and cost pass -through from 
businesses to consumers. The MPC stands ready to deploy additional appropriate monetary policy tools if

FCI is calculated using firstprincipal components of both FX and non -FX financial condition indicators which are weighted by their respective sizes of accumulated impu lse response on real GDP (%yoy) over 8 quarters 
using VAR(2) model. For funding costs and private credit categories, weights of each variable are adjusted according to its p roportion in total private funding structure. Non -FX indicators include (1) funding costs , 
(2) private credit, (3) global market volatility, and (4) stock market.

Meanwhile, increased global financial market volatilities from concerns over the Omicron outbreak led to a slight 
tightening in financial conditions.Monetary Policy Decision
The minimum loanrates (MLR) offered by commercial
banks remained below pre -COVID levels. Meanwhile, 
new loan rates (NLR) increased slightly from September 
2021 especially for loan contracts larger than 500 million 
baht of businesses in utilities, commercial, and property 
sectors where loan demand has increased. Commercial 
banks remained concerned about the credit risks of 
their borrowers. NLR also increased for contracts 
smaller than 100 million baht of businesses in the 
commercial and manufacturing sectors.
The yield spread between corporate and government
bonds (corporate credit spread) with maturities below 
3 years remained stable from the previous quarter.
The corporate credit spread for BBB-rated bonds decreased 
slightly but remained high overall. Notwithstanding, the 
private sector was still able to obtain financing through 
the bond market as normal. 0246810

Q3/2021Large corporates were still able to obtain financing inthe third 
quarter of 2021. Large corporate loans (credit limit > 500 
million baht) expanded across almost all sectors. This was 
driven by their need for more capital in anticipation of an 
economic recovery once containment measures are relaxed. 
Corporate bond issuance continued to expand at around the 
same rate mainly driven by the need to finance business 
expansions and repay existing debt. 
SME loans (credit limit ≤ 500million baht) saw continued 
improvements in the third quarter of 2021 . in part supported by 
the soft loan facility. SME loans growth was particularly strong for 
manufacturing and commercial businesses. However, loan growth 
for tourism -related services such as hotels and restaurants was 
still recovering at a gradual pace.

•In the fourth quarter of 2021, the baht averaged 33.3 baht per U.S. dollar, a depreciation of 1.3% from the previous quarter. The baht’s movements during the period have 
been volatile due to increased uncertainties. Around mid the fourth quarter, the baht appreciated from improved sentiment after Thailand’s re -opening plans were announced. This 
eased concerns among investors and resulted in capital inflows returning to Thailand. However, the baht depreciated sharply i n December from two main factors: (1) the outbreak of 
Omicron affecting the recovery of the tourism sector and (2) major central banks tightening their monetary policy stance soon er than expected. These factors led to a decline in investor 
sentiment and capital outflows from risky assets. Notwithstanding, there were still capital inflows for the Thai bond market.
•The nominal effective exchange rate (NEER)averaged 114.6 , a 0.15% depreciation from the previous quarter, indicating that the baht depreciated slightly more than regional peers .

Financial MarketElevated and unsustainable levels of debt ( i.e.debt overhang) might affect financial institutions’ balance 
sheets and weigh on economic growth in the period ahead.
Contagion risks could spread if large savings cooperatives or the Federation of Savings and Credit Cooperatives faced 
challenges. For instance, if they suffer significant loss from their investment in bonds and stocks, members could rapidly 
withdraw deposits thus leading to liquidity shortages.  
Financial institutions could face rising NPLs, resulting in an erosion of capital to the point that it could impact 
their credit ratings or ability to extend new loans
Contagion risks could stem from large corporates (significant corporate: SiCorp) if faced with problems. 
Examples of these problems include liquidity shortages, significant balance sheet losses, or credit rating 
downgrade to the point that could affect their ability to roll over debt. 
Financial market volatilities could lead to liquidity shortages for some groups of investors. Bond market 
mutual funds, for instance, could see their NAV decline from volatile bond yields and result in mass redemption 
by their unit holders and affects the liquidity of the fund itself.

set the monetary policy target for price stability such that headline inflation was to 
remain within the range of 1 -3% for the medium -term horizon and the year 2022.

Itwould benecessary toassess both theshort-term and
long-term impacts ofCOVID -19ontheinflation outlook
after thepandemic subsides .Thisisinlinewith other
central banks thatdecided tokeep theirmonetary policy
targets unchanged .Prolonged outbreak of COVID -19 has impacted both the global economy 
and the Thai economy. In line with recent inflation outturns in Thailand, 
it was expected that inflation in the period ahead would rise above the 
lower bound of the inflation of the 1 -3% target range but still remain
within the target range overall
Inflation intheperiod ahead would remain above thelower bound of
thetarget range .Thisisbecause :
1.Economic activities would likely recover atagradual pace after the
relaxation ofcontainment measures
2.Income andpurchasing power remained lowoverall duetorising
unemployment andpersistently highlevels ofhousehold debt
3.Prices ofgoods have declined from increased price competition
through e-commerce aswellaslower production costs fromtheadoptio n

However, inflation inThailand would likely bemore volatile intheperiod
ahead dueto:
•Volatilities in energy and fresh food prices
•Supply disruption and deglobalization leading to higher production costs

Why relax the LTV ratio?Expected benefits 
To further stimulate economic 
activities and sustain 
employmentThe measure would bring in new liquidity into 
the Thai economy and help sustain employment
through the property sector and other related 
businesses, which account for more than 9.8% 
of GDP and employs around 2.8 million people
To accommodate increased 
demand in the property 
market, especially among 
those with purchasing powerThe measure would help those looking to buy 
new residential properties to accommodate 
the new lifestyle brought about by COVID -19 
and those with high purchasing power. Down 
payments could be as low as 0%, compared 
to the previous minimum of 10 -30% of the 
property value.≡
