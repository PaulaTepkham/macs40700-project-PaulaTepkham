Monetary Policy Report  
 
 
The Monetary Policy Report  is prepared quarterly by staff of the 
Bank of Thailand with the approval of the Monetary Policy Committee 
(MPC).  It serves two purposes: ( 1) to communicate to the public the  
MPC’s  consideration and rationales for the conduct of monetary policy, 
and (2)  to present the latest set of  economic and inflation forecast s, based 
on which  the monetary policy decisions  were made .

Monetary Policy in Thailand  
Monetary Policy Committee  
Under the Bank of Thailand Act, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) comprise s the 
governor and two deputy governors, as well as four distinguished external members  
representing various sectors of the economy , with the aim of ensuring  that monetary policy 
decisions are effective and transparent.  
Monetary Policy Objective  
The MPC sets monetary policy to promote  the objective of supporting sustainable a nd full 
potential economic growth, without causing inflationary problems or economic and financial 
imbalances or bubbles.  
Monetary Policy Target  
The Cabinet  approved the annual average headline inflation target of 2.5 + 1.5 percent as the 
target for 2016 and for the medium  term. The inflation target  is to assure the general public 
that the MPC will take necessary policy actions to return headline inflation to the target within 
an appropriate time horizon without jeopardi zing growth and macro -financial stability.  In the 
event that headline inflation deviates from the target, the MPC shall explain the reasons 
behind the target breach to the  Minister  of Finance and the  public, together with measures 
taken and estimated time to bring inflation back to the target.  
Monetary Policy Instrument   
The MPC utilizes the 1 -day bilateral repurchase transaction rate as the policy interest rate to 
signal the monetary policy stance.  
Evaluati on of Economic Conditions and Forecasts  
The Bank of Thailand takes into account  information from all sources, the macroeconomic 
model, data from each economic sector, as well as surveys  of large enterprises , together with  
small and medium -sized  enterprises from all over the country,  and various financial institutions  
to ensure that economic evaluations and forecasts are accurate and cover all aspects, both at 
the macro and micro levels.   
Monetary Policy Communication  
Recognizing the importance  of monetary policy communication to the public, the MPC 
employs  various  channel s of communication, both in Thai and English, such as (1) organizing 
a press statement at 14 :00 on the day of the Committee meeting, (2) publishing edited 
minutes of the MPC meeting two weeks after the meeting, and (3) publishing the Monetary 
Policy Report  every quarter.  Monetary Policy Report  December  2016

 The Thai economy is projected to expand by 3.2 percent in 2016 and 2017 driven 
mainly by private consumption, public spending, and exports of services. The current estimates 
are close to the projections in the previous Monetary Policy Report . Key drivers  include: (1) 
expansion in private consumption supported by improv ed farm income,  (2) continued fiscal 
stimulus, and (3) recovery in merchandise exports. These positive developments offset (1) the 
slowdown  in exports of services that was a result of recent government measures to curb illegal 
tour operators and subdued  tourism  activitie s during the mourning period, (2) low  private 
investment, and (3) the lower -than-expected momentum from government consumption . 
Nevertheless, the Thai economy faces increas ed downside risks and greater  uncertainties from 
both domestic and external factors.  
Headline inflation projection for  2016 and 2017 is revised down from 0.3 and 2.0 
percent to 0.2 and 1.5 percent , respectively.  This downward revision reflect s the subdued 
inflationary pressures from the gradual recovery in demand and lower fresh -food pric es despite 
rising oil prices . The Committee thus expects headline inflation to return to the lower bound of 
the target band within the first quarter of 2017 . Meanwhile,  core inflation is revised down given 
a slower rise in prices of food purchased for cons umption at home and away from home . 
The Monetary Policy Committee decided to keep the policy rate on hold at both 
meetings in November and December 2016. According to their assessment, the overall 
economic and inflation outlook was largely unchanged from the previous quarter as the 
econom ic recovery remains on track with headline inflation on the rise. Meanwhile monetary 
conditions remain accommodative and conducive to the economic recovery. F inancial stability 
remains sound , although there are pockets of risks that continued to warrant close monitoring . 
Nonetheless, the Thai economy would still be facing a number of uncertainties going forward, 
and thus the Committee will closely monitor risk developments and their impact on the Thai 
economy , and conduct m onetary policy in an appropriate and timely manner to support the 
ongoing recovery  without contributing to unnecessary accumulation of fragilities in the financial 
system.  Monet ary Policy Report December 2016           2 1.1 Growth and inflation prospects  
The Committee maintains the GDP 
growth forecast for 2016 and 2017 at 3.2 
percent (Table 1.1).  Key growth drivers 
include private consumption, public spending,  
and exports of services. The decision to 
maintain the forecast is due to  (1) higher -
than-expected private consumption given  
improv ed farm income thanks to  higher  
agricultural output and rubber prices, (2) the 
slight recovery in export receipts , and (3) 
additional fiscal stimulus. These positive 
developments  help offset (1) the slowdown in 
exports of services, (2) low private  investment, 
and (3)  lower -than-expected growth in public 
spending  especially in government 
consumption.  
Regarding  the inflation outlook , as 
the economy is expected to expand in 2016 
and 2017 at a rate close to the previous 
assessment , demand -pull inflationary  
pressure s remain largely unchanged , 
slowly increas ing in tandem with the closing 
of the output gap (Chart 1.1) . Meanwhile,  
cost-push inflationary pressures has 
softened  given the significant decline  in 
fresh food prices . This is particularly the case 
for the prices of rice as well as fruits and vegetables which declined after the drought 
subsided and expected to return to normal 
levels earlier than expected. Meanwhile, the 
unexpected pickup in oil prices has push ed 
up production costs of goods and services  
domestically , albeit not enough  to offse t the 
fall in fresh food prices. In addition , lower 
prices of fresh  food is likely to slow down the 
increase in prices of food purchased for 
consumption at and away from  home in the 
period ahead. The Committee therefore 
revises the  core inflation forecast for 2016 
and 2017 down from 0.8 and 1.0 percent , 
respectively , to 0.7 and 0.8 percent. The 
headline inflation forecast for 2016 and 
2017 is also revised down from 0.3 and 2.0 
percent to 0.2 and 1.6 percent, 
respectively.  Nonetheless, the Committee 
expects headline inflation to return to the 
lower bound of the target band within the first 
quarter of 2017, a slight delay from the fourth 
quarter of 2016 as reported in the previous 
Monetary Policy Report . 
The Committee has in corporated key 
economic developments into the growth and 
inflation forecasts as summarized below.  
(1) Trading partners’ economies 
are likely to expand at a pace close to the 
previous assessment  (Table 1.2), but face 
greater downside risks and uncertainties.

PercentMonet ary Policy Report December 2016           3 The Committee has made a slight  
upward  adjustment to trading partners' 
growth projection  for 2016 to account  for 
recent data releases for the third quarter of 
2016  that turned out better than expected . 
Several economies are projected to rec ord 
higher growth compared with the previous 
assessment due to  (1) a softer -than-
expected impact of Brexit on the United 
Kingdom (UK)  economy , (2) a better export 
growth in Japan, and (3) a gradual 
improvements in exports of Asian economies 
(excluding Japa n and China) that would  
bolster private consumption.  
For 2017, the projection  for trading 
partners' GDP growth is maintained at 3.1 
percent.  The Committee project s trading 
partners to gradually recover notwithstanding  
a higher growth base in 2016 . Nonetheless, 
growth momentum is likely to soften 
somewhat in tandem  with Asian 
economies which are expected to recover 
at a slower pace  given increased  uncertainties  
pertaining to the U.S. trade policies that might 
incline  toward greater protectionism under 
the new administration . This also include s a 
potential collapse of the Trans -Pacific 
Partnership (TPP)  which could defer  business 
investment among member countries . However, major advanced economies  are 
expected to recov er gradually supported by 
improving private consumption . 
Monetary policies in major advanced  
economies remain accommodative with 
an exception of the U.S. The Bank of 
England (BOE) has continued to  purchase  
government and corporate bonds along side 
the use of Term Funding Scheme (TFS). 
Meanwhile, the European Central Bank 
(ECB) has extended its quantitative easing 
(QE) program from until  March to until 
December 2017. The Bank of Japan (BOJ) 
maintains its negative interest rate policy and 
quantitative  and qualitative easing (QQE) 
with yield curve control. On the contrary, the 
Federal Reserve raised  the federal funds rate 
up by 0.25 percent on December 14, 2016 
and revised its dot  plot to reflect a faster 
normalization path  from two to three  hikes in 
2017. 
The outlook for trading partners' 
economies possess es a larger degree of 
uncertainties , especially from the impact 
of the U.S. economic policies  under the 
new administration  that remain unclear in 
many aspects  including  trade , immigration, 
and tax cuts. Such uncertainties along with 
monetary policy divergence in major 
advanced economies would  add to volatility 
in global financial markets and international 
capital flow s by more than previously 
expected. Moreover, to account for  improved  
investors' confidence on U.S. economic 
growth and the Federal Reserve ’s 
normalization path into the exchange rate 
assumption , the Committee expects  Asian 
currencies (excluding the renminbi ) to be 
weaker than the previous assessment.

as of 2014 (13 countries )Monet ary Policy Report December 2016           4 Risks to growth in trading partners' 
economies are tilted toward  the downside . 
Key risk s and uncertainties are (1) 
uncertainty in monetary policies of major 
advanced economies, (2) uncertainty in the 
U.S. economic policies, (3) uncertainty 
pertaining to the  post-Brexit trade and 
investment negot iation between the UK and 
EU, (4) political uncertaint ies in Europe that 
may heighten  due to the up coming elections 
in several member countries especially 
France and Germany, and (5) risks in the 
European and Chinese financial  system s. 
These risk factors will affect volatility in the 
global financial markets and may  have a 
greater -than-expected  impact on the real 
economy.  
(2) Global oil prices have risen 
faster than previously expected (Chart 
1.2), after OPEC  has reached an 
agreement to cut production , resulting in 
a likely increase  in prices of non -oil 
commodit ies. The Committee thus revises 
up assumptions on Dubai prices in 2016 and 
2017 from 41.0 and 50.0 U.S . dollars per 
barrel to 41.4 and 53.5 U.S. dollars per  barrel , 
respectively. The increase is mainly due to 
the tighten ed supply after an agreement to 
cut production was reached among OPEC 
members in the ir meeting on November 30, 
2016 and among Non-OPEC producers  in 
their meeting on December 10, 2017. The 
prod uction cut will prompt global crude 
prices to reach equilibrium faster. 
However, higher crude prices might  
induce higher production of shale oil  
which would maintain  downward 
pressure on oil prices going forward.  In 
this regard, crude  price s are expected to stabilize in the second half of 2017 when 
shale oil production resumes and gradually 
ramp up in response to higher demand given 
the ongoing global economic recovery.  
 In addition, higher oil prices relative 
to the  previous assumption will affe ct 
commodity  price s. Metal prices face upward 
pressures  as the  market expect s a recovery 
in global demand from the U.S.  infrastructure  
investment policies under the new 
administration .  
 Going forward, risks that could 
make global crude oil prices deviate from 
the baseline  projection  are balanced.  Key 
downside risks include  an earlier -than-
expected resumption in  shale oil production 
and lower global demand for oil in the case of 
a sluggish global recovery. Upside risks 
come from conflicts in the Middle East  that 
could  spread to major production sites. 
Furthermore, the Committee view s that 
the outlook of global crude prices remain s 
largely uncertain as a result of supply side 
factors , namely  (1) market concerns over the  
implementation of production cut and (2) 
uncertainty in the U.S. economic and energy 
policies that can add further volatility.   
(3) The number of tourists has 
declined more than previously assessed

Sep 16         Dec 16U.S. dollar per barrelMonet ary Policy Report December 2016           5 due to measures to curb illegal  tour 
operators and limite d festivities during 
the mourning period for the late King .  
The government ’s measure to 
curb illegal  tour operators has had a 
stronger impact on tourism than the 
previous assessment,  according to which 
the impact would be limited in the short term 
to only some businesses. In the period 
ahead, the increase in the prices of packag e 
tours to Thailand may prompt  price -sensitive  
Chinese tourists  to travel to other 
destinations. Moreover, tourism during the 
mourning period has muted  slightly due to the 
absen ce of  public celebrations during  the first 
30 days , although the situation is expected to 
improve in early -2017.  
At the same time, the government 
has issued new measures to support  the 
tourism sector , including (1) a temporary 
discount on visa -on-arrival fees by 1,000 baht 
for tourists from 19 countries between  
December 2016 and February 2017, (2) an 
extension to the  permitted periods of stay in 
Thailand for tourists on long -stay visas, and 
(3) an eff ort to foster  mutual understanding 
and confidence among Chinese tour 
operators and tourists. The Committee 
expects the first two measures to bolster  the 
number of  foreign individual tourists . The 
Committee thus revises the projected 
number of foreign touri sts for 2016 and 
2017 down from 33.6 and 36.3 million to 
32.4 and 34.1 million, respectively.  
(4) Farm income has improve d on 
the back of both prices and output.  Prices  
of agricultural goods  have increased faster 
than previously assessed,  especially for rubber after output declined due to flood s in 
the Southern region. Meanwhile, output  of 
other crops has improve d after the drought 
subside d. Going forward, agricultural output 
is expected to receive a boost from the new 
water management plan for dry season  in 
2017, which includes higher water allocation 
for farming compared with the previous year 
as well as measures to encourage production 
of corn instead of second -crop rice in 2 million 
rais. The increased output will put downward 
pressure on prices of some products such as 
rice. However, the Committee sees that farm 
income would  not decline significant ly as the 
government has put forward additional 
measures to subsidize income for farmers 
including cash transfers to rubber farmers 
(11.5 billion baht), rice farmers (31.5 billion 
baht), and low -income farmers (6.5 billion 
bath), as well as  measures to support 
farmers who grow white rice, Pathumthani 
fragrant rice, and glutinous rice in addition  to 
jasmine rice (9 billion baht).  
Given  the developments above, the 
forecasts for growth and inflation can be 
summarized as follow:  
(1) While the volume of 
merchandise exports has improve d from 
the previous assessment, it is expected to 
recover slowly.  Improvements in export 
growth are limited to some industrial products 
that have benefited from the relocation of 
production base and expansion into new 
market s, namely  (1) electrical appliances 
due to increased foreign demand especially 
from Europe and t he U.S. , (2) automo bile and 
parts due to (a) relocation of pneumatic tires 
production bases from China to Thailand and Monet ary Policy Report December 2016           6 (b) an expansion into new market s by car 
manufacturers, and  (3) electronics due  to (a) 
an increase in demand from the U.S. for 
integrated circuits used in the production of 
smart phone s and (b) hard disk drive s that 
gained from the  consolidation of production 
bases from other countries into Thailand to 
reduce costs (details in Chapter 2). 
However, merchandise exports are still  
expected to grow slowly given  the gradual 
recovery of trading partners' economies , 
and structural issues pertaining to global 
trade as well as Thailand's manufacturing  
production  that would take time to 
resolve.  
Given the slight improvement in  the 
export  volume  and higher -than-expected 
prices of oil -related exports due to rising 
crude oil prices, the Committee adjusts the 
projections for export growth for 2016  and 
2017 from a contra ction of 2.5 and 0.5 
percent to an expansion of 0.6 and 0.0 
percent, respectively.   
Exports of services are expected 
to grow at a slower pace than in the 
previous assessment,  especially in the 
fourth quarter of 2016 and the first half of 
2017 due to the lower -than-expected number 
of foreign  tourists. Nonetheless, additional  
measures from the government to support 
tourism  and to strengthen confidence  and 
facilitate adjustment s on part of the tour 
operators that cater to Chinese tourists will 
help exports of services recover in 2017.  
Imports of goods and services are 
higher co mpared with the previous 
assessment.  Import s of goods  have 
increased in line with improv ed export growth and rising prices of oil and oil-related 
products. The projection of import of goods 
for 2016 and 2017 is therefore  revised  from a 
contracti on of 6.6 and an expansion of 5.6 
percent to a contraction of 5.0 percent and an 
expansion of 7.8 percent, respectively.  
Overall, the current account  in 2016 
has register ed a slightly larger surplus of 42.2 
billion U.S. dollars compared with the 
previous assessment at 40.4 billion. 
Meanwhile, the current account surplus in 
2017 is expected to record 26.9 billion U.S. 
dollars, smaller than the previous forecast of 
31.8 billion. The revision reflects a decline in 
receipts from exports of servic es and an 
increase in the value of imports of goods.  
(2) Private consumption has  
recorded  a larger improvement than 
previously assessed , partly due to actual  
data released for the third quarter of 2016 
that turned out better than expected, and 
is expected to continue  expanding . Key 
supporting factors are increasing farm 
income, rising export prices, and , in part , 
from the lower debt repayment burden in 
2017, as car loans under the first -car tax -
rebate scheme are due after five years.  
Furthermore , private consumption 
has receive d additional support from 
government measures  such as tax 
deduction incentives at the end of 2016 to 
stimulate consumption and cash transfers for 
low-income earners. The Committee expects 
these measures to boost private consu mption  
in the short term and support purchasing 
power of low -income households during 
periods when the economy has not fully 
recovered.  Monet ary Policy Report December 2016           7 (3) Private investment remains 
subdued  and will recover at a slower pace  
due to  a low level of  export of goods, the 
slowdown in exports of services , and greater 
uncertainties faced by both the global 
economy and the Thai econom y.  Nonetheless, 
investment by some businesses, such as retail  
and telecommunication, is expected to 
continue in tandem with demand expansion. 
In 2017, government policies will provide a 
great support to private investment through 
public -private partnership (PPP) and 
additional budget for village funds and urban  
communities .1 The latter is designed to 
provide low -cost funding for investment that 
will support private investment in provincial 
areas.  
(4) Budget d isbursement for public  
spending has been lower than previously 
expected especially for public consumption , 
although public investment is likely to be 
higher than the previous estimate.  Actual 
data for public  consumption in the third 
quarter of 2016 indicate a decline due to 
lower  disbursement efficiency and lower -
than-expected disbursement for social -
welfare transfers. Going forward, constraints 
on budget disbursement are expected to 
remain , while  the government's plan to allow 
private companies to manage health benefits 
for public -sector employees would  improve 
spending efficiency, but could re strain growth 
in government consumption.  
                                                        
1 The program is a part of the mid -year additional 
budget for      according to the Cabinet’s decision 
on December 7, 2016. Total spending according to 
this program will be 190 billion baht: (1) 100 billion 
baht for the strengthening and sustainable economy  
projects at the provincial level (Pracharat projects), 
(2) 62,922 million baht for village funds and urban At the same time, public investment  
in 2016 expands at a slightly slower pace 
from a delay in SOE budget disbursement, 
but is expected to pick up in 2017 given the  
Cabinet's recent approval for new projects 
and stim ulus measures. One of the measures 
is the 1 00 billion  baht Pracharat  projects  that 
encourage investment for social and 
economic developments in provincial areas. 
The program aims to provide additional 
support for existing public investment. 
Another measure is a program whereby  the 
government matches funding for investment 
projects between the central government and 
local governing agencies.2 
(5) Demand -pulI i nflationary 
pressures  remain largely  unchanged  in line 
with the growth forecast that was unchanged 
from the previous assessment.  Cost-push 
inflationary pressure  declined from the 
previous assessment because , despite 
higher oil prices , fresh food prices have 
rapidly declined since September  due to 
higher  agricultural output after the drought 
subsided.  In the period ahead, prices of fresh 
food will likely decelera te and return to the 
normal level. The lower costs of fresh food 
also mean lower price s of food for 
consumption both in and away from  home.  In 
this regard , forecasts for both core 
inflation and headline inflation are revised 
down.  The forecasts for core inflation in 2016 
and 2017 are 0.7 percent and 0.8 percent, 
respectively , down from 0.8 and 1.0 percent 
communities, and (3) 27,078 million baht for 
compensation of fiscal expenses.  
2According to the Cabinet’s decision on September 
13, 2016, the progr am aims to incentivize local 
governing agencies to utilize savings to develop 
economic and social infrastructure in the local area.   Monet ary Policy Report December 2016           8 in the previous assessment. Headline 
inflation for 2017 is projected at 0.2 percent 
and 1.7 percent, down from 0.3 percent and 
2.0 percent, respectively.  
Risks to Growth and Inflation Forecasts  
The Committee views that the 
balance of risks to growth continue to be 
tilted to the downside  as reflected in the 
growth forecast fan chart that is skewed 
downward throughout the forecast  horizon  
more than the previous Monetary Policy 
Report  (Chart 1.3).   One important downside  
risk to growth is the uncertainty surrounding  
U.S. trade policies that will have significant 
implications on confidence for trade and 
investment. This, in turn, wil l affect  the 
economic outlook for Thailand's trading 
partners. Other ongoing  downside  risks  
include  (1) risks in the Chinese financial  
sector  that may lead to slower growth for the 
Chinese economy  and (2) the number of 
foreign  tourists that may be lower than the 
baseline projection due to measures to curb 
illegal  tour operators . On the other hand, 
there are some upside risks  to growth  from 
a faster -than-expected disbursement of 
government stimulus programs or the 
implementation of additional stimulus 
measures. In addition, t he U.S. economy 
may expand at a faster rate than in the 
baseline scenario due to a stimulus package 
launched by the new president . 
With regard to inflation, the Committee  
judges the balance of risks on both 
headline and core inflation forecasts to be 
tilted to the downside  in line with the 
balance of risks to growth. In addition , the 
variance of forecast estimates is higher than 
the previous assessment due to uncertainties  
in oil prices and  the economic outlook (Charts 
1.4 and 1.5).

In the fourth quarter of 2016, 
monetary polic y remained accommodative to 
support the recovery. The outlook of the Thai 
economy has not changed significantly from 
the time of meetings in the previous quarter, 
despite increasing downside risks from both 
domestic and external factors. The 
Committee sees that the Thai economy 
would be facing uncertainties domestically 
and globally and will closely monitor 
developments and assess the impact of risks 
to the economic recovery. The Committee 
would stand ready to utilize an appropriate 
mix of monetary policy to ols to support 
Thailand's economic recovery in a timely 
manner without contributing to  financial 
fragilities to the financial system.  
At the MPC meeting on November 
9, 2016 , the Committee voted unanimously to 
maintain the policy rate at 1.50 percent. The 
Committee assessed that the Thai economy 
continued to expand despite increased 
downside risks  especially from heightened 
uncertainties in the global economy. These 
include political developments abroad and 
risks to financial stability in Europe and China 
that could hinder growth in trading partners ’ 
economies . The  government's measure to 
curb illegal tours might also cause the 
number of Chinese tourists to turn out lower 
than  the previous projection. The Committee 
would continue to monitor the effect of such  
measure on growth momentum in the tourism 
sector. As the Thai economy still faced 
high uncertainties, the Committee, 
therefore, affirmed the need to preserve policy space to cushion potential impact 
should these risks materialize by 
maintaining the policy  rate at the current 
level. Going forward, key risks are a 
fragile global recovery and uncertainties 
in economic and monetary policies of 
major advanced economies that could 
add volatility to capital flows and 
exchange rates.  In order to formulate the 
appropriate monetary policy,  the Committee 
would then continue to closely monitor risk 
developments and assess their impact on the 
Thai economy . 
Headline inflation rose slowly, with 
a higher possibility of returning to the 
target band later than assessed in the 
previous Monetary Policy Report . The 
potential  delay is caused by a slowdown in 
recovery of fresh -food prices due to supply 
factors. Noneth eless, headline inflation 
was still expected to gradually pick up, 
while the public's expectations on the 
medium -term inflation remained close to 
the inflation target.  In the period ahead, the 
Committee assessed that structural changes 
would keep global in flation relatively low. 
Such changes include a shift in global oil 
production that would prevent crude oil prices 
from accelerating to a high level as in the 
past. Technological advancement and 
telecommunication would also reduce prices 
of goods and servic es. This inflation outlook 
is a challenge to central banks around the 
world (see Box: Flexible I nflation Target ing in 
an E volving Global Economic Landscape ). 
The Committee would keep a close watch on 
factors affecting inflation and stand ready to 
utilize a n appropriate mix of availability policy 
tools in order to ensure that inflation returns 
to the middle point of the target band and Monet ary Policy Report December 2016           10 anchor the public's medium -term inflation 
expectations.  
Monetary conditions remained 
accommodative and conducive to the 
econ omic recovery.  Liquidity in the financial 
system remained high with low borrowing 
costs as reflected in negative real interest 
rates. Total corporate financing slowly 
increased in line with the gradual pace of 
economic recovery but still concentrated in 
some industries. However, the Committee 
viewed that the  recent appreciation of the 
baht relative to key trading partner 
currencies might not be beneficial to the 
economic recovery. While  regional 
currencies  including the baht  weakened 
against the U.S. dollar , but the baht 
depreciated to less compared with overall 
trading partner currencies given Thailand's 
sound economic fundamentals and external 
stability.  
In addition, the Committee viewed 
that the conduct of monetary policy  under 
the prolonged low interest rate 
environment must take into account 
financial stability considerations. While 
financial stability remained sound overall, 
there are pockets of risks that warranted 
close monitoring. These included the 
deterioration of businesses loan quality, 
particularly among small -and-medium -sized  
enterprises (SMEs) and households. In 
addition, the search -for-yield behavior, 
especially in unrated bonds, might lead to 
underpricing of risks and therefore warranted 
close monitoring. The Committee saw these 
risks as closely connected  with the financial 
system. Thus, the use of policy tools to 
prevent an accumulation of imbalances in the financial system must be systematically 
conducted with collaboration across various 
agencies to limit systemic risks. 
At the following meeting on 
December 21, 2016 , the Committee voted 
unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 
1.50 percent. In deliberating this decision, the 
Committee assessed that the Thai economy 
overall continued to expand at a pace 
close to the previous assessment as key 
economic drivers remained largely 
unchanged from the previous meeting.  
Although tourism slowed and private 
investment remained sluggish, negative 
impacts were of fset by improvements in 
merchandise exports and private 
consumption. Meanwhile, public spending 
continued as a major growth engine. 
However, downside risks to growth 
increased from the possibility of weaker -
than-expected trading partners'  economies. 
Trade policies of the new U.S. administration  
might affect international trade and 
confidence of the private sector.  Moreover, 
the number of Chinese tourists might turn out  
lower than previously  estimated . In addition , 
ongoing risks from political developments i n 
Europe and banking concerns in Europe and 
China still required continued monitoring. 
Headline inflation was expected to pick up 
and return to the target band within the 
first quarter of 2017  although the timing 
would largely depend on developments of oil  
and fresh food prices. Monetary conditions 
remained accommodative and conducive to 
the economic recovery, although long -term 
bond yields rose to the similar level as the 
average in the previous year following an 
increase in the U.S. Treasury yields.  Monetary Policy Report December 2016           11 In deliberating this decision, the 
Committee gave due consideration to 
Thailand's ongoing economic recovery.  
Although the recent expansion appeared to 
concentrate in some sectors with higher 
downside risks, supporting factors for growth 
momentum continued, especially those from 
government measures. Going forward, the 
Committee assessed that the Thai 
economy woul d face heightened 
uncertainties  from a fragile global recovery 
and uncertainties in economic and monetary 
policies in major advanced economies. 
Particularly, the U.S. policies under the new 
president that still remained unclear would 
have significant impli cations on the pace of 
recovery of Thailand's trading partners 
economies and contribute to volatilities in 
international capital flows and exchange 
rates. The Committee therefore would 
continue to closely monitor risk 
developments and assess their impacts on 
the Thai economy to formulate appropriate 
monetary policies to support the recovery of 
the Thai economy in a timely manner, without 
adding unnecessary accumulation of 
financial  fragilities to the system.  
Going forward, the Committee saw 
the need for continued accommodative 
monetary policies and would stand ready to 
utilize an appropriate mix of available policy 
tools in order to support the economic 
recovery and ensure financial  stability.

Flexible Inflation Target ing  
in an Evolving Global Economic Landscape  
The Bank of Thailand has adopted flexible inflation targeting as its main framework for 
the conduct of monetary policy since 2000. The policy framework is conducive to a disciplined 
formulation  of monetary policy to maintain price stability through  clear communication of the 
monetary policy  target, with  sufficient  flexibility in implementing monetary polic y to cope with  
shocks, thereby allowing the economy to reach potential in a sustainable manner.  
However, monetary policy implementation under the flexible inflation targeting 
framework has become more challenging . Recent volatilities in the global economy have 
caused uncertainties for Thailand’s economic recovery and made inflatio n forecast  more difficult. 
Over the past year, inflation in most inflation -targeting countries were below the targets1/ (Chart 
1). First,  global crude oil prices did not rise as much as  in the past  due to structural  
changes  in oil production. Advancements in the shale oil extraction technology allow faster 
response of oil supply to price movements. At the same time, the global oil demand recovery 
was subdued consistent  with fragile economic conditions . Second,  excess producti on 
capacity in the global economy  prevented businesses from increasing prices . Third, 
structural shifts in the global economy such as roles of the rise of  technologies that reduc e 
business costs, particularly in service sectors which continue to gain incre asing shares in the 
econom y.

The greater challenge has led inflation  targeting central banks to review the 
appropriateness of the target and its flexibility under the evolving landscape.  Some 
central banks such as the Bank of Korea have adjusted their inflation targets downward in line 
with lower inflationary pressures. However, most central banks have decided to keep their 
existing targets. In their view, inflation target should be a mediu m-term objective , and further 
analyses have to be undertaken to see  whether changes in inflation  dynamics  are due to 
economic cycles or structural shifts, because changing an inflation target will affect inflation 
expectations  formation . 
Another option f or central banks  to 
enhance the effectiveness of the monetary 
policy framework to respond to heightened 
volatility and the evolv ing global economic 
landscape  is to have appropriate flexibility 
for their inflation targets.  The main approach 
used by most central banks is by s etting a 
tolerance band  to accommodate various 
events, especially supply -side factors that 
may affect the economy and cause inflation 
to deviate from the target in the short term. 
For Thailand, the tolerance band for the 
inflation targ et is set at ±1.5 percent. The 
band is slightly broader than ±1.0 percent  
used in other countries because inflation in 
Thailand tends to be more volatile, especially 
during periods of large fluctuations in crude 
oil prices , because of t he small er proportio n 
of excise taxes in domestic  oil prices that 
caused prices to fluctuate along  with global 
crude oil prices (Chart 2) . In addition, retail 
oil prices account for a large  share of 
Thailand’s consumer price  basket relative to 
other countries2/.  Nevertheless, such a  
tolerance band is not too wide to affect 
monetary policy credibility  (Chart 3) . This 
was reflected in the latest  long-term inflation 
expectations, which were still close  to the 
inflation target of 2.5 percent.

economy and inflation. Attempts to bring headline inflation back to the target within too short a 
time horizon  may increase volatility in the financial markets and jeopardize  long-term mac ro-
financial stability. Therefore, setting a medium -term target  is another approach  used by 
inflation -targeting central banks to look through  short -term shocks and allow due consideration 
for macro -financial stability in the conduct of monetary policy. In this manner, central banks can 
bring headline inflation to the target in an appropriate timeframe consistent with sustainable 
economic growth and macro -financial stability. In the case of Thailand, the Monetary Policy 
Committee (MPC) recognizes the importa nce of adopting an appropriate inflation -targeting 
policy horizon . Accordingly, in addition to setting an annual monetary policy target as mandated 
by the law, the MPC communicates to the public that such annual target also serves as the 
inflation target f or the medium  term. From 2016 onward, the memorandum of understanding 
between the MPC and the Minister of Finance on monetary policy target clearly specified that 
the inflation target would serve as both the annual target and the medium -term target.  
Settin g a tolerance band and a medium -term inflation target to enhance the flexibility of 
the monetary policy framework may cause confusion among the public if inflation breach es the 
target for an extended period. Therefore, central banks need to emphasi ze commu nication 
of inflation developments and monetary policy actions  to increase  public understanding 
and anchor the public’s inflation expectations. The MPC has duly done so through 
communication of the medium -term inflation target  with a  focus on macro -financi al stability in 
monetary policy formulation , including issuing open letters in the case that headline inflation 
breach es the target.  
With regard to 2017, the MPC and the Minister of Finance jointly agreed to set the 
headline inflation of 2.5 ± 1.5 percent as the medium -term monetary policy target and the 
target for 2017 , with  cabinet approval on December 20, 2016. As the target  is close to those 
adopted in developing countries that are inflation targeters, it would help maintain Thailand ’s 
price competitiveness. Moreover, the tolerance band would help  cushion against shocks  that 
may affect inflation and anchor the public’s inflation expectations.  
The MPC’s forecast  of the annual average  of headline inflation for 2016 at 0.2 
percent turned out to be less than the lower bound of the target at 1 percent for two 
consecutive years. However, the MPC decided to maintain the target adopted for 2015 
and 2016 because the Committee anticipated inflation to trend up gradually owing to a 
variety of fact ors, and that monetary policy should remain accommodative to support 
economic recovery.  The main reasons that headline inflation stayed below the target were low 
global crude oil prices and  a   subdued domestic economic recovery, weighed down by export 
contractions as the country’s trading partners continued to face a slow recovery. However, 
thanks to some upturn in oil prices since the second quarter of 2016, headline inflation turned 
positive in April 2016 and edged up gradually. The MPC projected  that headline inflation would 
return to the target within the first quarter of 2017.  Monetary Policy Report  Decemb er 2016  19 As mentioned above, the conduct of monetary policy will become more challenging in 
the period ahead owing to structural changes  in the global economy that may affect the global  
and domestic  inflation dynamics, including (1) structural changes in global crude oil 
production which could  prevent sharp rises in oil prices as in the past , (2) reorientation of the 
economic structure  from manufacturing to service s that could lower inflationary pressures 
in line with lower service costs stemming from technological developments and innovations , 
and (3) aging population  in many countries. The effects of aging on inflation are not yet clear. 
Inflationary pressures may be lower  as an inc reasing tendency to save could lower 
consumption.3/ On the other hand , inflationary pressures may increase  as supply cannot keep 
pace with consumption demand , given  production capacity falls following a shrinking labor 
force.4/ The MPC would  thus  closely monitor  these  various factors, especially structural 
factors that could impact inflation dynamics and monetary policy  effectiveness , in order 
to effectively formulate a future monetary policy target and the conduct of monetary 
policy toward  the goals of price stability, economic growth, and macro -financial stability.

  In the third quarter,  the global  economy  recovered  at a gradual  pace.  Advanced  economies  
grew  mainly  on account  of private  consumption , consistent  with gradual  improvements  in labor  
market  conditions.  Meanwhile,  the Chinese  economy  continued  to slow down  due to ongoing  
economic  reforms.  Meanwhile,  Asian  economies  (excluding  China  and Japan)  grew  at a gradual  
pace  as exports  slowly  picked  up. However,  growth  momentum  for the Asian  economies  in the 
period  ahead  might  slow down  as private  investment  are affected  by increas ing uncertainties  
following  the U.S. presidential  election.   
The Thai economy  in the third quarter  continued  to expand  though  at a slower  pace  than 
the preceding  quarter.  Tourism  was a major  growth  driver  despite  a setback  from the bombi ng 
incidents  in the seven  southern  provinces  and the government  measure  to curb illegal  tour 
operators.  Private  consumption  expanded,  supported  by both farm and non-farm employment  and 
gradual  improvements  in farm income  after the drought  had subsided.  The export  sector  showed  
signs of improvement  in many  manufacturing  products.  Government  current expenditure  slowed  
down  in the last quarter  of the fiscal  year after disbursements  had been  expedited  earlier , while  
capital  expenditure  continued  to expand.  However,  improve ments  in private  consumption  and the 
gradual  recovery  of exports  were  still unable  to spur private  investment  on a broader  scale  despite   
growth  in investment  in certain  industries , particularly  export -oriented  manufacturing . 
Headline  inflation  increased  due mainly  to higher  energy  prices.  Core  inflation  remained  
stable  as demand -side inflationary  pressures  remained  subdued . Looking  ahead,  the Committee  
expected  headline  inflation  to gradually  rise and return  to the target  band  within  the first quarter  of 
2017,  though  the timing  would  depend  largely  on developments  in global  oil prices.  Monetary Policy Report  December  2016   21 2.1 The global economy  
 Advanced Economies  
Advanced economies slowly recovered  
on account of private  consumption (Chart 
2.1). At the same time,  monetary conditions 
tightened after the U.S. presidential election , 
while the euro and the yen depreciated vis -à-
vis the U.S. dollar.  
The U.S. economy in the third 
quarter of 2016 grew  by 2.3 percent (qoq 
saar) , a rebound from a slowdown during 
the first half of the year.  The expansion was 
supported by a steady growth in consumption, a 
smaller contraction of investment  in the energy 
sector following higher oil prices, and an 
inventory build -up after a  consecutive decline  
in the last five quarters . Recent economic 
indicators pointed to a continued expansion 
through increased retail sales, improved 
confidence,  and a stead y rise in employment.  
In the period ahead, monetary 
conditions would likely tighten after the 
Federal Reserve raised its policy rate by 0.25 
percent on December 14, 2016. This was the 
second rate hike since the global financial 
crisis in 2008 (the first w as on December 16, 2015). Moreover, the Federal Reserve ’s 
expectations of future rate increases , as 
reflected in the dot plot, increased from two 
to three  hikes  in 2017. Nevertheless , the U.S. 
economic recovery was expected to continue , 
driven by consumption that was backed by 
improved labor market conditions, despite 
weak private investment. Most analy sts 
viewed that the outcome of the U.S. 
presidential election would benefit the U.S. 
economy in the short  run due to growth -
oriented economic policies , especially the tax 
deduction which can be implemented  rather 
quickly . However, such policies could affect 
fiscal sustainability in the future. Meanwhile, 
inflation was expected to rise and could affect  
both the Federal Reserve ’s monetary policy 
directions and global financial markets 
conditions going forward (see Chapter 3). 
Moreover, the impact of trade protectionism 
policies needs to be monito red (see Box:  The 
Impact of President -elect Donald Trump’s 
Policy on the Global Economy ). 
Euro area e conomies grew by 0.3 
percent (qoq sa) in the third quarter of 
2016—a slowdown from the first half of the 
year during which  growth  accelerated due to 
warmer than usual weather.  Growth in 
Germany and Spain was slightly lower than 
the previous quarter , while France and Italy 
recorded an improvement . Private consumption , 
the main growth  driver, was supported by 
gradual improvements in employment and 
accommodative monetary policy. Recent 
economic indicators pointed to a gradual 
recovery of economic activit ies; in particular,  
the Purchasing Managers’ Index  for the 
manufacturing sector  stood above 50.

economies were expected to recover slowly 
with a weaker momentum due to tighten ed 
monetary conditions  as European government  
bond yields rose in tandem  with U.S. 
Treasury yields. In the period ahead, the euro  
area economies would face risks from (1) 
political uncertainties that could impact the 
economic recovery, especially the general 
elections in France and Germany in 2017  and 
the post-Brexit  trade negotiations between 
the UK and the EU , and (2) risks in the 
European banking sector . For the latter, 
although the overall situation gradually 
improved , some countries, especially Italy, 
still possessed high ratios of  non-performi ng 
loans and needed additional capital injection 
for some banks.  
The Japanese economy grew by 
0.3 percent (qoq sa) in the third quarter of 
2016 , down from the first half of the year. 
Private investment contracted as business 
sentiment remained low. Meanwhile, 
government expenditure expanded on the back  
of spending on repair and reconstruction after 
the earthquake and additional stimulus 
measures. Recent economic indicators 
suggested that economic activities remained 
on a recovery path as consumption continued 
to expand given consumer confidence picked 
up following government stimulus policies.  
Going  forward, the Japanese 
economy would gradually expand, supported 
by continued monetary policy easing and 
government stimulus measures. However, 
there rema ined important  risks,  namely  (1) 
volatility in the global financial market that 
could impact the yen and (2) transmission of monetary policy and fiscal policy to the real 
economy that might be less effective than 
expected.  
 China  
The Chinese economic slowdown 
continued as a result of ongoing economic 
reforms to foster long -term stability.  
The Chinese economy in the third 
quarter of 2016 expanded at the same rate 
as the first half of the year at 6.7 percent . 
Investment improved in the real estate and 
manufacturing sectors ; infrastructure 
investment, which remained a key factor 
supporting China’s economic growth , continued  
to record high growth rates despite some 
deceleration . Meanwhile, t he manufacturing 
and export sectors continued to slow down . 
Recent  economic indicators suggested a 
continued expansion from the previous 
quarter (Chart 2.2) . However, infrastructure 
investment began to slow down after having 
accelerated in the previous period. Activities 
in the real estate s ector also dampened after 
the measures were imposed to curb 
speculation and credit expansion since the 
end of September 2016.

Source : CEICPercentMonetary Policy Report  December  2016   23 Looking ahead, China’s economic 
slowdown would continue further as a 
consequence of ongoing economic reforms 
and stricter monitoring of speculation in the 
real estate sector. The economy was 
expected to grow around the official target of 
6.5 to 7.0 percent in 2016. Financial stability 
risks in China, however, continued to warrant 
close monitoring, namely (1) high level of 
corporate debt, (2) speculation in the real 
estate sector, and (3) net capital outflows.  
 Asia (excluding China and Japan)  
Asian economies recovered slowly 
on the back of gradual improvements in 
private consumption and exports. However, 
the recovery for the period ahead might be 
slower than the previous projection.  
Asian economies recovered at a 
gradual pace in the third quar ter of 2016 
despite a slowdown in some countries 
(Chart 2.3).  This was partly due to an 
acceleration of government disbursements  
during the beginning of a fiscal year. Private 
investment  slowed down due to overcapacity 
in the manufacturing sector. Moreover, 
business confidence in some countries, such 
South Korea and Malaysia, remained weak 
due to uncertainties surrounding domestic 
politic al developments . However, private 
consumption and n et exports continued to 
expand , especially exports of electronic 
good s by Taiwan, Hong Kong , and Malaysia, 
which still benefited from the high-tech cycle 
upturn thanks to new product launches in the 
third quarter.  
 Looking ahead, Asian economies 
would recover gradually but at a slightly 
slower pace than previously assessed in the 
previous  Monetary Policy Report . This could 
be attributed to an expected slowdown in 
private investment as a result of increased 
uncertaint y after the U.S. presidential 
election. Meanwhile, consumption would 
continue to expand and exports recover on 
the back of export of electronic good s. 
However, the economic recovery in the 
period ahead still face d risks stemming from  
(1) consumption that might slow down more 
than expected given the high level of 
household debt and tighter -than-expected 
monetary conditions, and (2) structural 
changes in global trade where by countries 
depend more on domestic production, 
potentially weigh ing on the export rec overy 
more than expected.  
2.2 The domestic economy  
The Thai economy in the third quarter 
continued to expand though at a slower pace 
compared with the previous quarter (Chart 
2.4). Tourism was a major growth driver

in the seven  southern provinces and the 
government measure to curb illegal  tour 
operators. Private consumption expanded, 
supported by both farm and non -farm 
employment and gradual improvements in 
farm income. Ex ports of many manufacturing 
products improved. The government’s role in 
driving the economy declined somewhat  as 
government current expenditure slowed 
down in the last quarter of the fiscal year after 
disbursements were earlier expedited . 
However,  capital expenditure continued to 
expand. Nonetheless, improved private 
consumption and the gradual recovery of 
exports were still unable to spur private 
investment on the broader  scale  despite 
growth seen in certain industries, especially  
export -oriented manufacturing . 
Tourism sector remained a major 
growth driver in the third quarter despite 
downside risks in the short  term from 
measures to curb illegal tour operators. 
Nevertheless, these measures would help 
bring about improvements in the quality of 
tourism businesses as well as sustainability 
in longer  term.  Tourism  continued to record strong  
growth . Despite the bombing incidents in the 
seven  southern provinces at the beginning of 
the quarter and measures to curb illegal  tour 
operators at the end of the quarter , the 
number of Chinese a nd Malaysian tourists 
still expanded while European tourist  figures  
also recovered. Moreover, the number of 
Middle Eastern tourists accelerated after the 
end of the Hari Raya festival (Chart  2.5). 
Looking ahead, however,  tourism faced 
greater  downside risks stemming from the 
government’s measures to curb  illegal tour 
operations . In the short run, such  measure s 
would lead  to a significant decline in the 
number of Chinese tourists . On the  supply 
side, Thai tour operators delayed or 
canceled inbound tours from China for fear of 
being charged. On the  demand side , the 
imposition of price floor for tour packages to 
reflect actual costs made tours to Thailand 
less cost competitive than countrie s such as 
South Korea and Japan .  However, survey 
results indicated  that tour business operators 
in Thailand viewed measures to  curb on 
illegal  tour operators  to yield medium - to 
long-term benefits  as they improved  quality of 
services. This would in turn improve the 
overall quality of both operators and tourists  
which is a key factor that enable d Thai 
tourism to achieve sustainable growth and 
greater value -added.

record a strong e xpansion , supported  by 
employment, farm income , and government 
measures.   
Private consumption  expanded in 
the third quarter, albeit  at a slower rate than 
the previous quarter (Chart 2.6). Supporting 
factors came from  improved employment 
both in the farm sector  after the drought 
subsided and in the non -farm sectors —both 
manufacturing and service s. Farm income 
also increased though not for all agricultural 
products. Moreover, spending on services 
was stimulated by temporary factors, namely 
a long holiday in  July and the 15,000 baht tax 
deductions to promote tourism in 2016.   In the period ahead, private 
consumption  would recovery gradually and 
expected to receive additional push from 
government stimulus measures, especially the 
tax deduction of 15,000 baht for domestic 
spending on goods and services at the end of 
2016 .  
The value of merchandise exports 
improved in many industries on account of rising 
demand for some products, expansion  into new 
markets , and partly a result of  the consolidation 
of product loc ation  for some products  to 
Thailand such as hard disk drive s.  
Merchandise exports  in the third 
quarter rebounded in many categories (Chart 
2.7) thanks to r ising demand , expansion  into 
new markets , and the consolidation of 
product location for some products to  
Thailand that helped support overall exports . 
Exports  that expanded on account of 
rising demand include d (1) electronic 
products and integrated circuits for (a) 
smartphones whose demand rose during the 
launch of new smartphones at the  end of the 
year, ( b) electr ical appliances  with internet

hard disk drives  would likely  decline in the 
long term with the technological shift toward 
solid-state drive s, and solar  cells  whos e 
production base was relocated from China. 
Nonetheless, t he export sector continued to 
face structural challenges , including 
declining  import dependence  on the global 
scale  and Thailand’s subdued  investment, 
which together could weaken the recovery of 
exports in periods ahead.  
Public spending continued to drive 
the economy  despite to a lesser extent in the 
third quarter. While current expenditure 
slowed down after the acceleration in the 
previou s quarter , capital expenditure 
continued to expand.  
The government’s role in drivin g the 
economy declined somewhat  in the third  
quarter as current expenditure slowed down 
in this final  quarter for fiscal 2016, partly a 
result of the acceleration in the previous three 
quarters. Nonetheless, capital expenditure 
continued to be well disbursed (Chart 2.8)  for 
housing  projects, road  construction , and 
irrigation systems. Moreover, capital 
expenditure of state -owned enterprises  continued at a healthy pace, particularly for 
investment projects according to the 
infrastructure and electric rail development.   
Private investment on the whole 
remained low, despite improvements in some 
industries with better business and  export 
outlooks.  
Private investment  remained low, 
both for investment in equipment and 
machinery and in construction (Chart 2.9). 
With sufficient production capacity, 
businesses still awaited clearer trends in 
global and domestic demand. Investment 
was mostly  undertaken  by the same firms  in 
the service sector  — those in  
telecommunication, alternative energy , and 
logistics and warehouses. Moreover, the 
improvements in  exports had led to more 
investment in some industries, as reflected 
by increases in impo rted capital goods and 
capacity expansion by export -oriented 
industries (Chart 2.10).

2.3 Production cost and price 
conditions  
Headline inflation increased mainly 
due to higher energy prices. Core inflation 
remained mostly unchanged  as demand 
pressures remained low. In the period ahead, 
the Committee assessed that headline 
inflation would rise slowly and return to the 
target band within the first quarter of 2017, 
depending largely on developments of prices 
of crude oil.  
Headline infl ation increased, averaging 
at 0.47 percent in the first two  months of the 
fourth quarter (Chart 2.11).  The increase was 
due to rising domestic oil prices , as global crude prices increased  in anticipation of an 
agreement to cut production by the 
Organization of th e Petroleum Exporting 
Countries  (OPEC ). Meanwhile, prices of 
fresh food fell  on account of l ower prices of 
fruits and vegetables due to increase d supply 
after the drought subsided.  
Core inflation averaged at 0.73 
percent in the first two months of the fourth 
quarter (Chart 2.12 ), close to that in the 
previous quarter. Weak demand -pull 
pressures were a result of a gradual recovery 
of the domestic economy, as reflected by 
underlying in flation indicators which remained 
at low levels (Chart 2.13).  Meanwhile, prices of 
most goods and services in the consumer price  
basket remained unchanged, indicating 
limitations of businesses in adjusting  prices 
(Chart 2.14).

 Looking ahead, the Committee 
expected headline inflation to rise gradually 
and return to the target band in the first quarter 
of 2017, supported by increases in  crude 
prices  following the cut in oil production by 
OPEC as well as  the low base effect . 
Furthe rmore, stronger demand -pull pressures 
following the economic recovery would allow 
businesses to raise prices of goods and 
services. However , uncertainties in global oil 
prices remained a major risk to inflation 
forecasts.

on the G lobal Economy  
The outcome of the U.S. presidential election and policy changes  
The outcome of the U.S. presidential election on November 8, 2016 with Donald Trump’s 
victory was taken positively  by investors , as reflected by stock market gains in major advanced 
economies (Chart 1) . The U.S. economy 
was expected to benefit in the short term 
from fiscal stimulus measures, which already 
raised inflation expectations in major 
advanced economies.   
Major economic policy proposals  by 
President -elect Trump during the election 
campaign covered several areas. For 
example, taxation, trade protection, and 
deportation of immigrant workers (Table 1).  
Clarification on the new U.S. administration’s  
policies in terms of their possibility, scale , 
and timing of implementation is therefore 
very important and warrants close monitoring . 
Some of the more defined policies 
were the following: (1) tax policy  with the proposed cuts in both personal and corpora te taxes could 
plausibly be implemented around the end of 2017 and the new fiscal year, and (2) infrastructure 
investment  policy  with private funding through issuance of infrastructure bonds could be only partly 
implemented, according to analysts’ views, because returns on some projects were not very attractive  
to the investors . However, other policies remained unclear, such as immigration and trade 
protection policies.  According to analysts, these policies would be difficult to implement due to 
several li mitations. On immigration, for example, with shortages of the number of public employees , it 
would take time for the policy to be implemented  and need to do it in a gradual pace . Trade protection 
policy could breach WTO and NAFTA agreements that have limitations from complicated and lengthy 
legal procedures, with many member countries involved in the process. The Trans -Pacific Partnership 
(TPP) might be an exception as the U.S. has not  officially  ratified and could withdraw immediately. 
However, policies sh ould become clearer after the presidential inauguration in early 2017.

Index  10 November 2016 = 100 Monetary Policy Report  December  2016   31 Impact on global economy  
Analysts viewed that the U.S. economy would benefit in the short term from fiscal 
stimulus measures  aimed at boosting household spending and corporate investment even before 
the official inauguration. Those measures have already shown a positive impact via improved 
confidence, a stronger U.S. dollar, and higher U.S. Treasury yields following higher infl ation 
expectations. These developments, nonetheless, were expected to also influence the Fed’s 
decisions on policy interest rate rises.  
The impact on Asian economies is expected through the following channels . 
(1) Trade and investment channel  
Asian econom ies would be differently affected depending on their trade linkages and 
reliance on direct investment from the U.S. While exports of Asian economies could gain from a 
higher growth of the U.S. economy, especially for countries which have a high level of di rect trade 
with the U.S., the benefit might be reduced due to a more protectionist trade policy. Beside, countries 
in China’s supply chain could be indirectly affected by more U.S. restrictive trade with China (Chart 
2). Furthermore, countries that highly depend on direct investment from the U.S.  (Chart 3)  could be 
affected by the policy support ing U.S. companies to reshore back to the U.S. with the aim to increase 
employment in the country . 
 
 
(2) Financial channel  
Volatility in the financial markets heightened following the U.S. presidential election and 
monetary conditions tightened in some countries  as government bond yields in Asia rose in line with 
U.S. Treasury yields. Moreover, countries with fragile external stability could be facing net capital 
outflows and rapid currency weakening, which would put constraints on implementing 
accommodative monetary policy during the economic slowdown.  
(3) Confidence channel  
Although policies of President -elect Trump remained  unclear in many areas, the policy 
directions were acknowledged and anticipated by investors and the public. The policies were

investment  project considerations  that had to take into acco unt risks from increased policy 
uncertainty.  
In the Committee’s assessment, President -elect Trump’s policy directions would have a 
significant impact on the economies and policies of Asian countries including Thailand in the period 
ahead. Many policies remained unclear in terms of possibility, scale , and timing of implementation 
and would therefore require close monitoring .  Monetary and Financial StabilityMonetary Policy Report December  2016    33 3. Monetary and Financial Stability  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  Volatility in the global financial markets surged following the U.S. presidential election. 
U.S. Treasury yields rose with increased inflation expectations. Investors also expected the 
Federal Reserve to raise its policy interest rate in December. As a result, there were net capital 
outflows from emerging markets into the U.S. markets. Thailand‘s overall monetary conditions 
remained accommodative. Money market interest rates remained  at low levels. Meanwhile, 
corporate cost s of funding through the debt market increased from the previous quarter, 
consistent with the increase in Treasury yields, but remained lower than the average cost s in 
2015. Relative to the end of last quarter, the baht depreciated against the U.S. dollar, as with 
most regional currencies, while the nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) strengthened 
mainly as a result of the yen depreciation against the baht.  
Thailand’s overall economic and financial stability rema ined sound. This was reflected 
in the high levels of capital buffers and provisions for loan losses maintained by commercial 
banks to cushion against risks from lower loan portfolio quality. While the search -for-yield 
behavior continued in the prevailing l ow interest rate environment, signs of underpricing of risks 
were limited. Nevertheless, debt serviceability of the household and business sectors, especially 
SMEs, as well as outstanding supply of residences in certain areas continued to be a concern 
and warranted continuous monitoring.  Monetary Policy Report December  2016    34 3.1 Financial markets1/ 
Global financial markets   
Volatility in global financial markets 
heightened, as indicated by the volatility 
indices2/ (Chart 3.1). In September 2016, 
volatility temporarily spiked because some 
investors expected the Fed eral Reserve  to 
raise its policy interest rate at the policy 
meeting. In November  2016, higher volatility 
was observed following Donald Trump’s victory 
in the U.S. presidential election.  Expectations 
that the new U.S. administration’s  economic 
stimulation policy such tax reductions and 
increase  in government spending would 
support a  stronger U.S. economic growth and 
accelerate higher inflation prompted investors  
to adjust their behavior and inflation 
expectations.  As a result, U.S. Treasury 
yields rose  (Chart 3.2) , spurring increases in 
government bond yields of other countries.  In 
addition,  investors expected a higher probability 
that the Federal Reserve  would raise its policy 
interest rate in December and quicken the 
pace of interest rate rises in 2017.  Due to the 
releases of the better -than-expected U.S. 
economic data and the higher inflation 
expectations , investors withdrew their money  
from emerging markets  (EMs) including

In the period ahead, the MPC would 
closely monitor developments in global 
financial markets and international capital 
flows in view of risks to market volatility which 
included monetary policy divergence among 
major advanced economies. The Fed eral 
Reserve increased its policy rate  on 
December 14, 2016, in line with investors’ 
expectations. Moreover, the expectations of 
future rate rises, as indicated in the dot plot,

monetary easing wit h yield curve control with a view 
to achieving the price stability target of 2 percent 
(announced on September 21, 2016) . The ECB 
decided to extend its quantitative easing program by increased from 2 to 3 rate r ises in 2017. 
Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) and the 
European Central Bank (ECB) continued to 
adopt a monetary policy easing stance3/.  
There were also geopolitical risks that may 
affect the economy and financial market 
volatility, such as the new U.S.  government’s 
policies and elections in France and Germany 
in 2017.  
Thai bond and equity markets  
Short -term money market rates during 
October to December 2016 remained close to 
the policy rate (Chart 3.5) . One-month 
government  bond yield  increased slightly  and 
moved closer to the  policy rate. Long -term 
government bond yields fluctuated, as 
influenced by both domestic  and overseas 
factors, before rising along with U.S. Treasury 
yields following the U.S. presidential election 
and the policy interest rate hike  by the 
Federal Reserve . As a consequence, l ong-

to the similar levels as the averages for last

Source: Institute of International FinanceMonetary Policy Report December  2016    36 Credit spreads between corporate 
and government bond yields were largely 
stable around the previous quarter’s level. As 
a result, costs of financing through corporate 
bond issuance rose along with the increase in 
government bond yields which were used as 
the reference rate. However, overall financing 
costs stayed below the previous year’s 
averages  (Chart 3.7).   The Stock Exchange of Thailand 
(SET) Index and the Market for Alternative 
Investment (mai) Index between October 
and December 2016 advanced slight ly 
from the previous quarter (Charts 3.8 and 
3.9). Local retail and institutional investors 
were both n et buyers , partly as investors 
priced in the government’s stimulus 
measures and in view  of the investment in the 
energy shares  following increases in world oil 
prices. Meanwhile, foreign investors were net 
sellers since October  and possibly  to continue 
selling until year -end. Foreign investors 
reduced the weight of Thai and EM assets in 
their portfolios  partly due to the m arket 
expectations  that the Federal Reserve would 
raise its policy interest rate in December 2016 .

The baht depreciated against the 
U.S. dollar relative to the end of the 
previous quarter, consistent with 
movements of most regional currencie s. 
Since investors expected a higher probability 
that the Federal Reserve  would raise its 
policy interest rate in December after 
releases of better -than-expected U.S. 
economic figures and higher inflation 
expectations were shown following the U.S.  
presidential election , the U.S. dollar was 
continued to strengthen  against bath . As a 
consequence , foreign investors reduced their 
holdings in EMs including Thailand. After the 
Federal Reserve  raised its interest rate, the  
U.S. dollar continued to strengt hen in line 
with market expectations. At times, the baht 
depreciated more quickly and more steeply 
than other regional currencies on concerns 
over the domestic situation. On December 
20, 2016, the baht closed at 36.01 baht per 
U.S. dollar, down 3.7 percent fro m the end of 
the previous quarter. The NEER was at 
107.96, up by 1.6 percent from the end of last 
quarter, primarily because of the yen 
depreciation. Sentiments in global financial 
markets improved over both economic 
prospects and policy directions in the U.S., 
thereby dampening demand for the 
Japanese yen or considered as safe haven 
assets. The real effective exchange rate 
(REER) appreciated by 0.8 percent. The 
REER’s appreciation was smaller than that of 
NEER because Thai inflation remained lower 
than oth er countries (Charts 3.10 and 3.11).  
The baht volatility was more 
pronounced in October, but subsequently the baht stabilized after the domestic situation 
had eased and a clearer picture emerged. 
Volatility was reduced to a medium level 
relative to regiona l currencies (Chart 3.12) . 
Going forward, global capital flows and 
exchange rates were expected to remain 
volatile in view of external uncertainties, 
particularly policy directions of the new U.S. 
government and monetary policy directions in 
the advanced e conomies .

Financing c osts for firms and deposit 
rates offered by commercial banks remained 
steady from the previous report.  Meanwhile, 
overall demand for new financing increased 
from the  second quarter of 2016  across all 
instruments . This was reflected by an 
increase in n ew bond issuances by large 
corporates and an increase in lending by 
commercial bank  mostly  in the form of loans 
for work ing capital. Meanwhile, loans for 
capital investment declined in line with low 
levels of private investment. Overall c redit 
conditions and outlook showed  signs  of 
improvement , although deposit  growth reduced  
banks’ needs to mobilize additional deposits 
as liquidity remained ample.

(added October 2015). The 12 -month average deposit rate of remaining banks in the fourth quarter of 
2015 had declined from previous quarter partly because Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank (Thailand) offered 
relatively lower rates. Monetary Policy Report December  2016    39 Total corporate financing between 
August and October 2016 recorded an 
increase relative to the second quarter 
across all instruments  (Chart 3.13) . The 
increase was attributed mainly to bond 
issuances by large corporates as the cost of 
bond financing remained low. These bond 
issuers were mostly firms in the wholesale 
and retail trade, energy, and real estate 
sectors.  
Commercial bank lending also 
increased,  especially in new loans to the 
wholesale and retail trade,  telecommunication, 
and electricity generation and transmission 
businesses  for domestic working capital 
purposes. Working capital credit for international 
trade increased somewhat in line with export 
growth . However, loan demand for investment  
declined as private investment remained  low. 
New e quity issuance  were mostly by firms in 
the wholesale and retail trade , and 
telecommunication sectors, but the overall level 
slowed down compared with the previous 
quarter.

between August and October 2016 
increased at a slower pace relative to the 
second quarter (Chart 3.14).  The slowdown 
was pronounced in new loans from 
specialized financial institutions after the 
government’s real estate stimulus measures 
had ended. Meanwhile, new loans from 
commercial banks increased, particularly 
credit card and car loans. The slowdown in 
new loans extended to households was 
consistent with the findings from the Credit 
Conditions Survey in the third quarter of 
2016. The Survey indicated that loan demand 
from household s was lower than in the 
previous quarter as consumer sentiment 
remained soft while financial institutions were 
also more cautious over car  loans and 
mortgage loans.  
Deposit outstanding at the end of 
October 2016 increased from the end of 
July, especially household deposits 
(Chart 3.15).  Growth of deposits including bills

improvement, but special deposit rates offered 
by commercial banks were unchanged from 
the previous quarter (Chart 3.16)  as there 
was no need for banks to mobilize additional 
deposits given stable bank liquidity. This was 
reflected in the lower loan -to-deposit

 Financial stability  
Financial stability remained sound  
overall , despite de terioration in credit  quality 
of consumer and business loan due to the 
extend period of the slow economic recovery . 
Nevertheless financial institutions stability 
remained s trong as banks continued to 
closely monitor credit quality and m aintain ed 
sufficiently high levels of  capital buffers and 
loan-loss provisions to cushion against risks 
stemming from declining loan quality. 
Meanwhile the search -for-yield behavior 
remained at large  but posed limited risks to the 
financial system as a whole .   
The credit quality of commercial 
bank loans at the end of the third quarter 
declined from the previous quarter due to 
the gradual economic recovery.  This was 
reflected in the  ratio of non -performing loans to 
total loans  (NPL ratio) which rose from 2.72 
percent at the end of the second quarter to 
2.89 percent, attributable to the increase in 
NPL ratios of among both business loans 
(especially  loans to SME s) and consumer 
loans (Chart 3.18).  The NPL ratio of SMEs 
continued to rise from 3.77 percent at the end 
of the second quarter to 4.04 percent, 
attributable to deterioration in credit quality in 
the manufacturing, wholesale and retail 
trade, and construction sectors given the 
gradual economi c recovery. At the same 
time, the NPL ratio among  large corporate s

Although the deterioration in credit 
quality of commercial bank loans affected 
profitability, but financial institutions 
stability remained s trong.  Commercial 
banks continued to closely monitor credit quality 
and maintained sufficiently high levels of capital 
buffers and loan -loss provisions to cushion 
against risks stemming declining loan quality. 
The actual to  regulatory loan loss provision ratio 
in the third quarter of 2016 was at 164.4 percent 
while the capital adequacy ratio was at 18.5 
percent, which is higher than the minimum set 
by the BOT at 8.5 percent.  
 The search -for-yield behavior remained  
at large amidst the prolonged low interest rate 
environment.  
With regard to  equity market  
movements, the  SET Index continued on an 
upward momentum , and s tock prices were 
high as reflected by the price -earnings 
ratios (P/E ratio) for the SET and the mai 
which were  above their historical 
averages  (Chart 3.20).  Nevertheless, signs 
of market overheating were not present since 
the turnover ratios of both markets remained 
low. Additionally , transactions  were mainly 
settled  in cash, and margin loans remained 
low at 12 percent of total transaction value as 
of October 2016.  
As for activities in the bond market,  
corporate bond issuance continued to rise  
and although most of these issuance 
possessed good credit ratings , issuance of 
unrated bonds by unrated companies were 
also on the rise. The proportion of unrated 
bonds to outstanding corporate bonds rose

over risks among these issuance might pose 
concerns with regard to liquidity risks.   
Nevertheless, systemic risks were deemed  
to be rather limited  as unrated bonds were 
main ly sold to institutional investors or 
accredited investors.  
Mutual funds  continued to grow  as 
indicated by the increase in the net asset 
value (NAV) from early September to 
October 2016, especially of foreign 
investment funds (FIF s) (Chart 3.22)  which 
mainly focused on investment -grade 
securities in the United Arab Emirates, the 
U.S., Luxemburg, Hong Kong , and Qatar.  
Funds that possessed d eposit -like 
characteristics remained popular, with growth 
observed in daily fixed income funds (daily 
FI), while money market  funds (MMF s) 
declined  in part due to investors’ search for 
higher yields. Although daily FI faced less 
stringent regulations and were able to invest 
in riskier debt securities than MMF s, risks 
remained contained as t heir investments 
focused on investment -grade bonds with 95 
percent of their holdings in public -sector bonds,  deposits and short -term debt instruments 
with A credit rating, while 31 percent of their 
total assets were considered highly liquid 
assets. In addi tion, the Office of the 
Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) 
continuously monitored bond issuance 
activities and oversaw that issuers 
appropriately disclose information to ensure 
that investors have proper understanding  of 
what they are investing in, and tightened  
bond issuance standards.  
Savings cooperatives’  deposits and 
shares also gained traction among savers as 
they offered higher interest rates and 
dividend yields than bank deposit rates 
(Chart 3.23) . The search -for-yield behavior 
was also observed in some savings 
cooperatives, as evident in their increasing 
proportion of equity assets while loans to 
members grew only slightly. However, equity 
assets still made up a small  1.5 percent of 
their total as sets (Chart 3.24).

Calculations by Bank of ThailandNet asset value (NAV )  (Mar 2015=100 )Monetary Policy Report December  2016    43 Overall, the search -for-yield 
behavior remained at large as interest rates  
are expected to remain low for a longer 
period of time , but the risks it posed to the 
financial system as a whole remained 
limited  and signs of broad -based underpricing  
of risks were not present. Nonetheless, the 
Committee would continue to monitor such 
behavior closely , especially among investors 
who continued to seek higher returns, and 
mutual funds and savings cooperatives that 
tended to invest in riskier assets, as well as 
competition among financial institutions in 
extending credit to large corporates and only 
certain sectors.  3.3 Non-financial sectors  
Household sector  
Households’ debt serviceability 
continued  to decline , as reflected  in the increase 
in NPL ratios of most types of consumer loans. 
Meanwhile, the slow economic recovery and 
high debt levels limited  households’ ability to 
adjust financially . However, slower growth of 
household debt and improved farm income as 
well as maturing first -car loan debts would 
improve the financial position of the household 
sector going forward.  
Households’ debt  serviceability 
continued to decline , as reflected in the 
increase in NPL ratios of almost all types of 
consumer loans, except car  loans, from 2.60 
percent in the previous quarter to 2.73 percent in 
the third quarter (Chart 3.25) . Moreover, some 
household s, especially those belonging to the 
low and medium income groups, may face 
intensified liquidity problems amid the slow 
economic recovery, as reflected  by their 
increasing reliance on consumer loans from  
non-banks , a concern which would be monitored 
closely  going forward .

Source: Cooperative Auditing Department, calculations by Bank of Thailand Monetary Policy Report December  2016    44 Although household debts was 
expected to decelerate  (Chart 3.26), the 
ratio of household debt to GDP remained 
at a high  81.3 percent in the second quarter, 
edging down from 81.5 percent in the 
previous quarter, thus constraining 
household ability to  adjust financially  going 
forward.  Household income, espec ially 
related to  the service sector, may be affected 
by the measures to curb illegal  tour 
operators . Nevertheless, certain positive 
factors were expected to boost household’s 
debt serviceability such as (1) the uptrend in 
income of farm households (Chart 3 .27), 
thanks to the government ’s financial 
assistance for the agricultural sector and the 
positive outlook for global  prices of some 
commodities, (2) maturing debt from the first -
car loans , and (3) minimum wage increases 
effective from the beginning of  2017.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Corporate  sector  
Performance of non -financial 
companies listed on the SET declined slightly 
in the third quarter of 2016. Debt 
serviceability also declined, especially for 
SMEs  whose financial positions were 
vulnerable to the slow economic recovery.  
Overall business performance in 
the third quarter remained sound despite 
a decline from the previous quarter.  
Corporates ’ revenue and profitability 
weakened somewhat, as reflected in  a lower 
operating profit margin and return on assets 
(Chart 3.28)  due to weaker s ales figure after  
government’s stimulus measures for the 
service and the real estate sectors ended.  
Meanwhile, sales in some sectors such as 
the construction sector remained robust due 
to progress in the public - sector infrastructure 
projects. Amid the gradual economic 
recovery, most businesses focused on cost 
management and other controllable factors, 
and thus were able to maintain high operating 
profit margins compared to the previous year 
(Chart 3.29).

Source: Stock Exchange of Thailand, calculation by Bank of Thailand Note: Median estimatesPercentChart 3.28 Operating profit margin and return on assets Monetary Policy Report December  2016    45 Overall corporate debt stabilized at 
a level close to the previous quarter.  The 
median D/E ratio remained low at  0.7.  Overall 
debt serviceability declined somewhat due 
with lower profitability but remained at a 
healthy level  with the median ICR at 5.8, well 
above the international standard of 1.5 (Chart 
3.30) . Although most business sectors were 
able to make adjustments amid the gradual 
economic  recovery and low interest costs, 
SMEs still had limited room to make 
adjustments and their financial positions 
remained fragile. Classification of listed 
companies into five quintiles based on asset 
size reveal ed that some companies in the first 
two quintiles  continuously experienced losses, 
as reflected in the continuously negative ICR 
(in first and second quintiles) at the 25th 
percentile. This indicates increasing debt 
default risks of small companies. Using these 
smaller companies as representatives for no n-
listed SMEs, it could be inferred that  debt 
serviceability of SMEs deteriorate d. This was 
consistent with the NPL ratio of SMEs at the 
end of the third quarter of 2016 which was 
expected to rise , especially in the 
manufacturing and wholesale and retail t rade 
sectors.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Real estate sector  
The property market in Bangkok and 
its vicinities continued to slow down in the 
third quarter of    6 after the government‘s 
stimulus measures for the sector had ended 
in the beginning of the year. Going forward, 
risks of unsold condominium units in some 
areas and price ranges, and lower debt 
serviceability of some operators that had 
weaker financial positions continued to 
warrant close monitoring.  
The property market in Bangkok 
and its vicinities continued to slow down 
in the third quarter of 2016  as dema nd 
receded after the reduced fee on ownership 
transfer ended in April 2016. Commercial 
banks also adopted more stringent lending 
standards given that loan affordability of 
buyers declined with prevailing high debt 
burden. This was reflected in the smaller 
number of banks ’ new housing loan 
approvals in Bangkok and its vicinities (Chart 
3.31) .  Demand was expected to slow down 
in the fourth quarter due to  the mourning 
period, which was conducive to property 
transactions. Post -finance quality also dropped,  
as reflected in the upward NPL ratio of

adopt more stringent lending standards.  
 
On the supply  side, the third quarter 
saw an increase in the number of new 
projects lau nched in Bangkok and its 
vicinities (Chart 3.33) . However, with fewer 
new projects launched in the first half of 2016, 
the total number of new projects launched in

 Risks to monitor in the period

(1) While outstanding supply does not 
pose a major concern  as the absorption rate 
of housing projects and condominium 
projects in 2016 stabilized at low levels at 2.4 
and 1.3 years respectively , the like ly increase 
in outstanding  supply in certain areas and 
price ranges  continued to warrant monitoring,

units costing over 5 million baht along the 
Green Line extension ro ute (Bearing -Samut

(Chart 3.36).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In additi on, in recent periods, 
developers became less reliant on borrowing 
from banks and shifted to alternative funding 
sources such as bond issuance, in particular 
unrated bonds (Chart 3.37) . 
Hence, monitoring of possible systemic 
risk would be needed going for ward in the 
event of debt default by issuers of unrated 
bonds, which may have repercussions on other 
operators via a fall in bond market investors’  
sentiment .  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fiscal stability  
Fiscal stability remained sound, as 
reflected in the public debt level which stayed 
below the fiscal sustainability threshold and 
the treasury cash balance that was deemed 
sufficient to meet unexpected fiscal needs. 
Nonetheless, pressures on fiscal stability 
would likely i ncrease in the periods ahead 
from additional borrowings needed for 
investment in transportation infrastructure 
projects, as well as future fiscal burden 
arising from recently approved stimulus 
measures.   
 Fiscal stability remained sound,  
as reflected in the public debt to GDP ratio 
which remained below the fiscal 
sustainability threshold of 60 percent. As of 
October 2016, the ratio stood at 42.7 percent, 
slightly up from 42.6 percent in August 2016 
(Chart 3.38) , mainly due to principal 
repayment  
to the Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural  
Cooperatives (BAAC) and bond  redemption  
by PTT Plc.  Treasury balance stood at 230 
billion baht at the end of October 2016, down 
from 303 billion baht at the end of August

Going  forward, pressures on fiscal 
stability are likely to increase  due to (1)   
borrowing for investment in infrastructure 
projects according to the transport 
infrastructure development strategy 2015 -
2022, especially rail and road projects, will 
largely raise p ublic debt in the next 2-3 years, 
and (2) additional fiscal burden from quasi -
fiscal activities that were part of the economic 
stimulus packages including compensation 
for the reduction of interest income to 
specialized financial institutions taking part i n 
the soft loan program.  In addition, if the 
government continue d to implement  tax 
reduction measures, government revenue 
would likely fall and pose risks to fiscal 
stability .
