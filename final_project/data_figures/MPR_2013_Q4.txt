The Monetary Policy Report  is prepared quarterly by staff of the 
Bank of Thailand with the approva l of the Monetary Policy Committee 
(MPC). It serves two purposes: (1) to communicate to the public the 
MPC’s consideration and rationales for the conduct of monetary policy, 
and (2) to present the latest set of economic and inflation forecasts, based 
on which the monetary policy decisions were made.

1.1 Growth and inflation prospects  
The Thai economy was likely to expand at  
a slower pace than previously projected, while 
inflationary pressure eased.  
In 2013, the Thai economy was expected 
to grow at a slower pace than previously 
projected. Demand slowed down in almost every 
aspect. The slowdown in priv ate consumption, partly 
as an adjustment from the previously extraordinary 
growth (payback period), was likely to protract and intensify more than expect ed. In addition, the decline 
in consumer confidence l ed households to exercise 
more caution in their sp ending. Public spending also 
declined from the previous projection due to lower-
than-expected disbursements from the 2013 budget 
by the central government and delays in infrastructure investment plans. Furthermore, exports recovered The Thai economy was expected to grow at a slower pace than previously 
assessed. Private consumption moderated more than expected as households 
exercised caution towards their spending. Government stimulus declined from 
previously assessed due to delays in budget disbursements and public infrastructure investment plans. The pickup of the export sector remained weak 
despite improving outlook for global economic recovery. Meanwhile, inflationary 
pressure eased mainly due to lower demand pressure. Overall cost pressure rose slightly, but the pass-through of costs to prices was limited.  
In the past two meetings, the MPC voted to hold the policy rate at 2.50 
percent per annum. The MPC deemed that an accommodative monetary policy stance to help support domestic demand remained appropriate given uncertainties 
in global economic and financial conditions.

in G3 economies. With regard to the outlook in 2014, 
the MPC assessed that the Thai economy would 
gradually gain momentum from 2013, thanks to the export sector which would take on a greater role in 
driving the Thai economy,  consistent with the 
expected pickup in trading partners’ economic outlook. Moreover, the drag on the economy from the 
slowdown of private consumption was likely to 
decline. Nevertheless, the economic growth projection for 2014 was lower than previously estimated 
because the weak recovery in exports would 
adversely affect private consumption and investment 
until 2014 (Chart 1.1  and Table 1.1) . 
The fragile global economy remained the 
key risk factor that could cause the Thai economy to expand lower than the baseline projection. The 
global economy would recover continuously at a 
gradual pace. Risks to recovery, however, were tilted towards the downside. The public debt ceiling 
problem could halt US economic recovery. 
Meanwhile, although there were signs suggesting that euro area economies had already passed the 
trough, recovery would be slow, while structural 
problems remained to be resolved. In Japan, the strong economic recovery in  Japan could be hindered 
by next year’s plan to ra ise the consumption tax. 
Domestic risk factors were also on the downside . 
It was possible that the structural constraints of 
Thailand’s exports could caus e the export sector to 
recover more slowly than expected. Moreover, public spending on infrastructure in vestment projects could 
be further delayed. Overall, the MPC assessed that 
risks to economic growth would tilt towards the downside more than previously assessed. The fan 
chart for growth was thus skewed down at a greater 
degree compared to the previous projection throughout the projection period  (Chart 1.2) . -10-505101520

demand pressure, while cost pressure increased 
slightly. Inflationary pressure from demand was 
likely to decline from previously assessed following the economic slowdown. Meanwhile, overall 
production costs increased slightly, as expected, 
following gradual LPG price hikes since September 2013. Inflation projections were thus adjusted down 
in 2013 and 2014 (Table 1.1) . Furthermore, the MPC 
assessed that risks to inflation would slightly tilt towards the downside given the possibility that 
demand pressure could be lower than assessed in 
the baseline case, in line with downside risks on economic growth outweighing upside risks. Fan 
charts for inflation were thus skewed downwards 
throughout the projection period (Charts 1.3 and 1.4) .

Ministry of Commerce, and calculation by Bank of Thailand  4    Monetary Policy Report  October 2013  1.2 Economic outlook  
The Thai economy was likely to grow at a 
lower rate than previously projected due to weakening private spending, lower-than-expected government 
stimulus, and slow recovery in exports. Nevertheless, 
the economy was expected to improve gradually in 2014, thanks to the export sector which would take on 
a greater role in driving the Thai economy, the pickup 
in private consumption after the payback period in 2013, as well as continuous public stimulus. 
 
The Thai economy was poised to moderate 
 Thai economic growth in 2013 was expected 
to slow down from previously assessed, given 
that drivers of economic growth, both domestic demand and export recovery, were lower than 
previously projected. In the second quarter, private 
consumption, particula rly on durable goods, slowed 
down by more than expec ted. Households also 
exercised more caution in their spending following 
higher debt burden and lower consumer confidence. 
Public spending was likely to be lower than 
previously assessed due to lower budget and  
non-budget expenditures. The two trillion baht infrastructure projects were likely to be postponed  
to 2014, rather than 2013 Q4 as previously expected. 
At the same time, merchandise exports were expected to recover slowly in line with major 
countries’ economic outlook. However, Thai exports 
did not benefit as much as  it should have from the 
global economic recovery . This was because the 
share of sophistic ated products in Thai exports was 
not high. Nonetheless, priv ate investment was poised 
to increase slightly from the previous assessment, 
thanks to strong investment growth in services and 
utilities as well as in constr uction. The tourism sector 
was likely to expand more than expected, while Monetary Policy Report  October 2013                    5 imports of goods and servic es were expected to 
decelerate in line with softer domestic demand and 
slow export recovery. 
 Weakening momentum of domestic demand 
and delays in export recovery led to a lower 
economic growth outlook (Chart 1.5 and Table 
1.2), especially in 2013 where economic growth 
projections were adjusted down rather significantly 
(Table 1.1) . For 2014, the MPC assessed that the 
Thai economy would gradually  gain momentum from 
2013, thanks to the export sector which would take 
on a greater role in dr iving the Thai economy, 
consistent with the pi ckup in trading partners’ 
economic outlook. Moreover, the slowdown in private 
consumption, which had put  a drag on the economy, 
was likely to improve. In addition, private investment 
was expected to increase wi th the continuation of 
previously planned investm ents and those related to 
the government’s large-scale  investment projects. 
Nonetheless, Thai economic growth in 2014 was 
projected to be lower than the previous projection, 
due to adverse knock-on effects from delayed export recovery on private cons umption and investment 
which would continue into 2014.

20156    Monetary Policy Report  October 2013  The global economy should recover gradually  
The global economy was expected to improve 
slightly, thanks to euro area economies which 
appeared to have passed the trough, and a pickup in the Japanese economy.  
Thailand’s trading partners’ economies 
were expected to recover gradually. Compared to the previous projection, the momentum in 2013 
increased slightly, while remaining close to the 
previous projection in 2014 (Chart 1.6). Euro area 
economies had just started to pass the trough and 
improved more than market expectation, recovery was 
thus expected to pick up sli ghtly higher this year. The 
Japanese economy gained mom entum from public 
stimulus measures. The US economy continued to 
recover, although the r eduction in government 
spending would remain a key constraint to economic 
growth in future periods. Meanwhile, Asian economies 
were likely to benefit fr om the global economic 
recovery in different degrees, with North Asian 
economies benefiting more t han the rest thanks to 
their export structure which comprised mostly sophisticated products.  
The US economy showed signs of 
continuous recovery, as previously assessed (Chart 1.7) . In the second quarter, investments in the 
housing sector expanded quite  robustly, reflecting 
continued improvements in demand. The MPC 
assessed that going forwar d, the US economy was 
poised to improve gradually. Th is was consistent with 
steady improvements in economic fundamentals, 
particularly in the housing se ctor where clear signs of 
recovery were observed, which would benefit 
households’ financial health and support future consumption. Moreover, the Fed’s decision to 
continue purchasing assets at a monthly pace of 85 
billion US dollars would help maintain continuous 
economic recovery. Alt hough private spending in the Q1

sovereign debt problems coul d cause uncertainties in 
the market and periodically affe ct investor confidence.  
Euro area economies appeared to have 
passed the trough in the second quarter and  
were likely to recover stronger than previously assessed (Chart 1.8) . Indicators in 2013 Q2 signaled 
an end to the six quarter economic recession, with 
production and spending acti vities beginning to 
improve. Meanwhile, the ec onomy started to stabilize, 
with the unemployment rate of major member 
economies, such as Germany, France and Italy, as well as the UK, falling mo re than expected. Going 
forward, economic reco very should continue, 
supported by (1) improved business sentiment, (2) a 
pickup in consumption in ma jor member countries, in 
particular Germany which grew on the back of robust 
labor market, and (3) reduced fiscal drag. Nevertheless, the economy w ould recover at a slow 
pace, due to the deleveragi ng process in both the 
public and private sectors. Moreover, most countries 
would still be faced with structural problems which 
would take time to resolve.  
The MPC, however, evaluated that risks to the 
euro area’s economic recovery  could stem from the 
sovereign debt problems whic h could intensify as a 
result of political uncer tainty in those member 
countries with weak economie s, as well as structural 
problems which would take time to address.   
The Japanese economy gained momentum 
throughout the projection period (Chart 1.9). 
Economic data in the second quarter reflected clearer 
signs of recovery, especia lly in the manufacturing 
sector and labor market. Government stimulus 
measures and continuous monetary policy easing 
would help pull the economy out of deflation. Manufacturing and private cons umption started to pick Left axis:           Jul 13 (baseline)     Right axis:     Change in baseline

accommodate the hike in consumption tax from 5 
percent to 8 percent in Ap ril 2014. The MPC, however, 
assessed that going forward economic recovery in Japan could somewhat be affe cted by the tax increase 
if the economy was not re silient enough to withstand 
the hike. Nevertheless, th is measure was considered 
an important step that woul d help restructure Japan’s 
economy and resolve the sovereign debt problem in 
the long term. 
In 2013, Asian economies (excluding Japan) 
were likely to expand slightly higher than 
previously assessed, but would grow at a lower rate in 2014 (Chart 1.10). Asian economies improved 
slightly in 2013 according to better-than-expected 
figures in the second quarter of a number of countries, such as the Ph ilippines and Hong Kong, as 
well as China whose econom y picked up in line with 
domestic demand and manuf acturing production. 
Nevertheless, for 2014, As ia’s economic outlook 
decreased slightly from the previous assessment, 
owing to an anticipated economic slowdown in 
ASEAN countries following weaker domestic 
demand. This was in part due to impacts from 
economic measures set up to maintain monetary, 
fiscal and balance of payment  stability. Meanwhile, 
the export sector was expected to recover at a slow 
pace. Exports of Asian c ountries could benefit from 
the global economic recove ry in different degrees, 
depending on each country’s  manufacturing and 
export structure. In this c onnection, countri es in North 
Asia, for example South Korea and Taiwan, which 
mainly export more sophi sticated products would 
benefit more. On the other  hand, countries that 
mainly export commodities  and products that do not 
require advanced technology, such as countries in 
ASEAN, would not fully benefit from the global economic recovery because they would be unable to Left axis:           Jul 13 (baseline)     Right axis:     Change in baseline

changing demand of the global market. 
Thai exports were poised to grow at a lower 
rate than previously projected.  
Thai exports were likely to recover slower 
than expected, owing to stru ctural constraints of the 
export sector. Meanwhile, exports of services were poised to expand continuous ly. Imports of goods and 
services decelerated in line with weak exports and 
domestic demand. 
The export sector was likely to expand at a 
lower rate than previously projected (Table 1.3).  
In 2013 Q2, merchandise export volume was much lower than assessed, with exports declining in  
almost every category, incl uding agricultural, fishery, 
manufacturing and petrol eum products. Nonetheless, 
in the third quarter, merchandise exports showed 
signs of improvement, but growth remained subdued. 
The MPC assessed that apart from temporary factors, namely supply shortages and deteriorating 
price competitiveness in rice exports, Thai exports 
would also be faced with lim itations from the export 
structure. This was becaus e most exported goods  
in Thailand were not produced using advanced 
technology, and as a result, may not benefit from the 
global economic recovery as  much as countries that 
exported more sophisticated products, as exporters 
were unable to keep pace wi th technology changes to 
satisfy global demand (more details in BOX: Structural 
constraints in Thai ma nufacturing production and 
long-term economic growth). Nonetheless, in the periods ahead, Thailand’s trading partners, in 
particular G3 countries, should be on a recovery 
trend, while Asian economie s should continue to 
expand. Thai exports were thus expected to recover 
more concretely in 2014, attributable mainly to 
exports in electrical appliances, automobiles and 
textiles which were likely to grow in line with global 10    Monetary Policy Report  October 2013  demand. At the same time, exports of services in 
terms of tourist revenue were expected to 
increase from previously assessed,  thanks to high

moderated further than previously assessed (Table 1.3),  owing to sluggish merchandise exports 
and domestic demand. Nevert heless, imports were 
likely to increase in 2014 in line with improved economic conditions. Moreover , capital imports in the 
medium- to long-term should gain support from a 
gradual pickup in investments of the private sector to 
restructure its manufactu ring production, and from 
the government’s large-scale investment projects.  
The current account balance
1/ was likely to 
record a deficit in 2013, which should continue 
into 2014 (Table 1.3) . The current account deficit in 
2013 was mainly due to exceptionally high imports of gold during the middle of t he year when gold prices 
declined. In addition, Japanese companies (particularly 
in the automobile industry)  remitted dividends back to 
Japan more than usual due to extraordinary high 
earnings in 2012 and to take advantage of the weak

in deficit, due to imports of capital and machinery 
which were expected to in crease in line with the 
investment trend of the pr ivate and public sectors.  
Private demand softened more than expected  
Private demand was likely to weaken more 
than expected due to a sl owdown in consumption 
during this payback period, while investments were 
poised to expand slightly higher than previously 
assessed. 
Private consumption was likely to expand 
at a lower rate than previously projected.  In 2013 
Q2, purchases of durable goods moderated by more 
than previously expected.  In addition, households 
became more cautious in  their spending on the back 
of higher debt burden and weakening confidence, 
consistent with the consumer conf idence in future 
income index which had not yet improved. In 
addition, financial instit utions’ lending standards 
remained tight. As a resul t, private consumption in 
the latter half of 2013 shoul d continue to weaken. 
Nevertheless, the MPC assessed that private 
consumption would gradually improve and return to 
its normal growth level around mid-2014, supported 
by (1) demand for durable goods, including automobiles, which were expected to recover gradually and return 
to normal levels during the middle of next year, and 
(2) income and employment that were likely to improve in line with export recovery, which would 
help improve households’ financial conditions and 
increase their conf idence to spend. 
Private investment in 2013 was expected 
to expand at a higher rate than previously 
projected.  In the past periods, investments in 
services and public utilities as well as construction 
grew stronger than previously assessed, in particular 
commercial construction bot h within and outside the 
municipal area. Nevertheless,  signs of an increase in 12    Monetary Policy Report  October 2013  new investments were not clearly observed. Due to 
the weakening prospect of  domestic demand, some 
entrepreneurs could postpone their investments in 
waiting to assess economic conditions. Meanwhile, recovery of merchandise exports was also delayed. 
Going forward, the MPC a ssessed that investments 
would expand more strongly in 2014, supported by (1) the likely pickup in domestic and foreign demand, 
(2) investments in machinery to accommodate labor 
shortage problems and improve productivity in accordance to original plans, (3) an increase in 
construction investment, partly to accommodate 
higher demand stemmed from  the regional economic 
integration under the AEC  framework, (4) strong 
business financial health, as reflected by improving 
operating profit margins, (5) high am ount of 
investment projects receiv ing promotion certificates 
issued by the Board of In vestment (BOI), and (6) 
accommodative monetary c onditions conducive to 
business operations. 
Looking ahead, the MPC vi ewed that private 
investment would still be faced with risk factors which would need to be monitored, including (1) delays  
in budget disbursements and large-scale public 
investment projects which could delay the crowding-in 
effect on businesses’ invest ment decisions and (2) labor 
problems, including labor shortages, low labor 
productivity and a mismatch  of the demand and supply 
of labor in terms of labor skills, which would remain key 
constraints to businesses. 
Fiscal stimulus declined from the previous 
assessment
 
The public sector would continue to provide 
economic stimulus throughout  the projection period, 
but at a lesser extent t han previously anticipated, 
owing to lower-than-expec ted budget disbursements 
and delays in non-budget expenditures in some infrastructure inve stment projects. Monetary Policy Report  October 2013                    13 Fiscal policy would continue to provide 
economic stimulus going forward as reflected by 
the 2013 and 2014 budget, including expenditures of 
the central government  and from non-budgetary 
loans which were likely to record a higher deficit of 
2.5 percent and 2.7 percent of GDP, respectively. 
Nevertheless, the budget def icit would decline from 
300 billion baht in fiscal year 2013 to 250 billion baht 
in fiscal year 2014, consist ent with plans to gradually 
reduce the budget deficit in  order to achieve  
a balanced budget in future periods. However, 
expenditures from non-budgetar y loans were expected 
to increase and compensate for the decline in budgetary expenditures (Chart 1.11) .    
Compared to the previous projection, 
fiscal stimulus declined overall  due to low budget 
disbursements as a share of the total amount of 
allocated funds, as well as the delay in disbursements 
of transfers and allocation of funds to local governments. Furthermore, not much progress was 
observed in the water management and the two 
trillion baht infrastructure projects, due mainly to 
problems in the approval process (Table 1.4) . The 
MPC, therefore, (1) reduced the assumption on 
public expenditures, both curr ent and capital, for the 
2014 budget, to be consist ent with the 2013 budget 
disbursement rate which stood at only 90.5 percent, 
lower than the target di sbursement rate of 93 
percent. Nevertheless, t he MPC expected that the 
carry-over of the capital budget would still be 
disbursed at the start of fiscal year 2014; (2) reduced 
the assumption on investment expenditures of the 
two trillion baht infrastructu re development projects 
throughout the projection peri od, from the previous 
expectation that the proj ects would commence in 
2013 Q4 to 2014 Q1; and (3) slightly reduced the 
assumption on the amount of  funding for the water 
management projects in 2013,  consistent with the 
most recent updates on t he projects’ progress. -5-4-3-2-10

Inflationary pressure was likely to ease 
Inflationary pressure had been easing 
continuously sinc e the beginning of the year and 
should ease further due to softening demand, while 
cost pressure increased slightly. 
Inflationary pressure from the demand 
side was likely to ease more than previously 
assessed, in line with the weakening economy. Households spent more carefu lly on account of lower 
confidence and possible impacts  from the higher debt 
burden. As a result, upward price adjustments of goods and services were lim ited. The prospect of 
lower inflation was consis tent with the slightly 
negative output gap during the latter half of 2013 
 
(Chart 1.12) . Going forward, however, improvements 
in the economy would lead to higher demand 
pressure which would help facilitate price adjustments of goods and services.  C onsequently, inflation in 
2014 would be higher than in 2013, in tandem with 
the output gap moving closer to zero. Table 1.4 Assumptions on public sector expenditure

2011 2012 2013 2014 2015Monetary Policy Report  October 2013                    15 Cost pressure increased slightly overall in 
line with gradual hikes in the LPG price since 
September 2013 and higher-than-expected world oil 
prices in 2013 Q3 following the short-term tightening of oil supply due to the unrest in the Middle East and 
Africa, especially in Syria and Libya, as well as 
improved investor confidence in the US and euro area’s economic recovery. The MPC assessed that 
going forward, Dubai crude oil prices  would remain 
stable at 105 US dollars per barrel until the first half of 2014 before increasing to 110 US dollars per barrel in 
the latter half of 2014 and remaining at that level for 
the rest of the projection period (Chart 1.13) . This was 
consistent with an expected increase in demand for 
crude oil following the global economic recovery. 
Meanwhile, the supply of world crude oil was likely to increase slightly following higher crude oil production 
in non-OPEC countries which would compensate for 
the possible decline in crude oil production in OPEC countries. The MPC thus deemed that supply and 
demand of world crude oil would likely balance out 
throughout the projection period. As a result, the high case and low case assumptions on the Dubai oil price 
were balanced at half a standard deviation above and 
below the baseline path. At the same time, world non-
fuel commodity prices declined  (Chart 1.14)  from 
both lower-than-expected metal prices which fell in line 
with lower demand from China, as well as food prices which declined in the past periods following high 
output. The MPC assessed that going forward, 
commodity prices were likely to remain stable given that the global economic recovery would be gradual. 
Meanwhile, domestic fresh food prices  for 2013 
would be similar to the previous assumption, but would be adjusted down for 2014, especially the price of rice. 
The decline in rice price stemmed from the 
government’s decision to reduce the off-season rice pledging price, together with a possible decline in 
global rice price following high world stock of rice.  Left axis:         Jul 13 (baseline)  Right axis: Change in baseline

such as Indonesia, had started to produce more rice 
as import substitution (Chart 1.15) .   
Moreover, Thailand’s policy on energy 
prices would also have an impact on cost pressure. 
The MPC maintained the assumption of a diesel 
excise tax exemption thro ughout the projection period 
and gradually increased the LPG price for the t 
ransport sector starting in March 2014 to adhere to 
the Committee on Energy Policy Administration’s (CEPA) decision. This was expected to keep cost 
pressure of the transport sector at a low level.
 
Looking ahead, the MPC assessed that 
risks to inflation would tilt slightly towards the 
downside  given the possibility that economic growth 
could grow less than expected, which in effect, would lead to lower cost pass-through. 
Alternative scenarios 
The MPC appraised that there were various 
scenarios where Thai economic growth could deviate 
from the baseline case. T he MPC thus took these 
scenarios into consideration to reflect key risk factors 
on the Thai economy and inflationary pressure going 
forward. 
Scenario 1: The global economy recovered 
slower than assessed. Risks stemming from the 
resolution of structural problems in G3 countries could 
delay economic recovery. Some examples include reductions in the fiscal def icit and resolution of 
sovereign debt problems in the US which could prolong, 
while uncertainties regarding the timing of QE tapering 
could periodically effect investor and consumer 
confidence. Additional risks included political 
uncertainties and impacts from fiscal austerity 
measures in the euro area, as well as a possibility that 
Japan’s economy may not be resilient enough to 
withstand next year’s consumption tax hike. These Left axis:           Jul 13 (baseline)   Right axis:     Change in baseline

-10Monetary Policy Report  October 2013                    17 factors could prolong economic recovery of G3 
countries, which in turn could also lead to lower 
economic growth in China and Asia. Under this 
scenario, the MPC appraised that Thailand’s economic growth could be lower than assessed in the baseline 
case. This would be attributable to sluggish 
merchandise exports on the back of weak trading partners’ economies. Moreover, farm income, especially 
income from rubber, would not recover due to China’s 
softening economic prospect. 
Scenario 2: Further delays in the two 
trillion baht infrastructure projects. Although the 
Senate accepted the loan b ill in principle which 
allowed the Ministry of Fi nance to borrow two trillion 
baht for infrastructure development on transportation 
in the first reading, it wa s possible that the process 
could be delayed. This wa s because some senators 
requested the Constitution Court to give a ruling on 
the loan bill to determine if  it contravened with the 
constitution or not. This could cause the amount of 
investment funds under this  project to differ from 
expected. Should the l oan bill process encounter 
problems, the government would be unable to 
approve and borrow funds to proceed with the 
various projects as planned. The MPC considered 
the case where the disbursement rate under  
this plan was lower than expected . In this 
consideration, some proj ects would still be able to 
proceed immediately in 2014 and 2015, namely 
projects under state enterpris es’ original plans, such 
as the sky train projec t, the suburban rail system 
project, airport link and the project to install road 
equipment and resolve traffic problems. Under this 
scenario, the MPC assessed that the Thai economy 
would expand less than the baseline case due to 
delays in public investment which would cause 
repercussions on private investment.  18    Monetary Policy Report  October 2013  Under both scenarios,  the MPC appraised 
that an accommodative m onetary policy stance was 
necessary to support recovery in domestic demand 
and must be prepared to withstand capital flows volatility that could stem fr om uncertainties over the 
US’ implementation of m onetary and fiscal policies. 
1.3 Monetary policy decision   
 Monetary policy stance remained accommodative 
In the past two meeti ngs, the MPC voted to 
hold the policy rate at 2. 50 percent per annum. The 
MPC deemed that an accommodative monetary 
policy stance to help support domestic demand remained appropriate giv en rapidly changing global 
economic and financial conditions. 
In its meeting on A ugust 21, 2013, the MPC 
assessed that the global  economy, especially G3 
countries, was likely to improve gradually. The Chinese economy started to show signs of improvement after 
having decelerated in the second quarter, while Asian 
economies grew somewhat lower than expected. The Thai economy continued to soften in the second 
quarter, broadly in line with the MPC’s previous 
assessment due to sluggish private consumption and exports. Looking ahead, domestic demand and 
exports were expected to recover gradually, with 
some risks of delay, partly owing to supply-side constraints. Meanwhile, in flationary pressure eased 
further, due mainly to lower demand pressure. The 
MPC deemed that the current accommodative monetary policy was necessary and appropriate for 
the ongoing adjustments in  the Thai economy, while 
risks to financial stability and uncertainties regarding global financial conditi ons warranted continued 
monitoring. The MPC thus voted 6 to 1 to maintain Monetary Policy Report  October 2013                    19 the policy rate at 2.50 percent per annum. One 
member voted to lower the policy interest rate by 25 
basis points, to support the continuity of growth in 
future periods. 
In its subsequent meet ing on October 16, 
2013, the MPC appraised t hat the global economy 
would improve gradually, though with substantial 
downside risks from uncertainties regarding the 
timing of QE tapering, as  well as sovereign debt 
problems in the US which could affect global financial 
and economic stability. T he Thai economy began to 
stabilize and showed signs of  improvement in the 
export sector, in line with trading partners’ economic recovery. Inflation edged lower in line with production 
costs which remained low and subdued demand 
pressure. Looking ahead, the MPC expected that the 
Thai economy was likely to re cover at a slow pace, in 
line with recovery in the export sector and waning 
effects from the decline in durable good purchases 
which had put a drag on the economy. Fiscal 
stimulus, despite delays in disbursement of some 
public expenditures, would still lend support to growth. The MPC assessed that the current 
accommodative monetary policy remai ned appropriate 
in supporting economic reco very in the periods 
ahead, given uncertain gl obal economic and financial 
conditions. The MPC thus  voted unanimously to 
maintain the policy rate at 2.50 percent per annum.

Percent2014 2015Monetary Policy Report October 2013    23 Structural constraints of Thai  manufacturing production  
and long-term economic growth  
 The recent recovery of gl obal economy has led to a pi ckup in exports of many 
countries, in particular those in North Asia which have seen their exports rising since the 
second quarter of this year. Thai exports, how ever, have not yet benefitted much from this 
global recovery (Chart 1) . This is mainly due to the structur al constraints of  the manufacturing 
structure in Thailand’s export industry, particula rly in the electronics i ndustry, which has not 
appeared to respond to changes in technology  and global demand. Even when the global  
economy does fully recover, it is  possible that Thai exports may not resume high growth and 
serve as the key driver of Thai economic growth as in the past.  
  
        
 Hard disk drives (HDD) and integrated circ uits (IC) are two key drivers of the 
manufacturing and export sectors in Thailand,  accounting for around 12 percent of total 
exports. Over the past 10 years (2003-2012), exports of these products had been expanding 
continuously, averaging at 7.8 and 3.8 percent per year, respec tively. However, during the 
first 8 months of 2013, HDD expor ts contracted year-on-year by  7.7 percent. For IC, although 
exports picked up slightly  in line with global 
demand, growth was lower and slower than 
IC exports of other count ries in the region, in 
particular South Korea and Taiwan. These situations have highlight ed limitations of the 
production capacity in Thailand’s electronics 
industry which has failed to adapt in order to retain its competitive edge as a production 
base for exports.   
 Thailand is the production base for 
the world’s largest HDD manufacturers. 
However, demand for HDD has been falling 
steadily as consumer s’ preference changed -10-5051015

HDD as a memory unit, to Smartphones 
or Tablets, which us e solid state drives 
(SSD) as a memory unit ( Chart 2 and 
Chart 3) . Although the world’s largest 
HDD manufacturers have attempted to 
maintain competitiveness by taking over and entering into joint ventures with SSD 
manufacturers, Thailand w ill continue to 
be the production base for HDD and has not yet been considered as a 
potential SSD producti on base. This is 
due to the lack of a supporting cluster for SSD industry as Thailand’s IC 
industry is not in the supply chain for 
these high-technology  products. This 
reflects that Thailand may not have 
sufficient capacity to draw investors to 
relocate high-technology production to Thailand. One of the main reasons is the 
lack of readiness of human resources, in 
particular the lack of engineers with specific expertise. This  is in line with the 
World Economic Forum’s recent survey 
released in September 2013 (Chart 4)  
revealing that from foreign investors’ 
perspective, Thailand’s competitiveness 
has decreased cons iderably. When 
compared to Malaysia and Taiwan, 
Thailand’s macroeconomic environment 
and market size are at a level where Thailand may remain competitive, 
reflecting that demand management 
policy in Thailand is not an obstacle to competitiveness. Apparently, the aspects that need to be improved upon must be addressed 
by supply management policies,  which are crucial in enhanc ing the country’s production 
capacity. These include labor  market readiness, technol ogical readiness, innovation 
development, quality of the educati on system as well as readiness in terms of infrastructure 
and public utilities.  
 These changes will take time before any real impacts on the economy can be 
observed.  Therefore, it is of  utmost importance t hat these issues be addr essed immediately, 
or else there is a chance that the gap between Thailand’s production capacit y and that of 
other countries in the region could widen further.  This, event ually, will become a key obstacle 
to sustainable growth in the long-term. Source: Global Competitiveness Index, World Economic Forum, 2013-2014

2.1 The global economy  
Economies of the US, euro area and Japan 
were poised to grow at a gradual pace. The Chinese 
economy was likely to reco ver continuously across 
every economic sector. East Asian economies 
improved, while ASEAN economies were likely to 
moderate from softer domestic demand. 
The US economy expanded gradually thanks 
to steady improvements in  economic fundamentals, 
particularly in the housing sector which recovered more concretely. Meanwhile, uncertainties regarding 
US fiscal policy would remain a key risk. 
In 2013 Q2, the US economy expanded by 
2.5 percent on a quarter- on-quarter, seasonally 
adjusted annualized basis (qoq saar) (Third estimate) 
(Chart 2.1) , accelerating from the previous quarter 
which grew by 1.1 percent. This was attributable to a 
pickup in domestic demand, especially from strong 
private consumption and in vestments in the housing 
sector. Economies of the US, euro area and Japan were poised to expand 
gradually. The Chinese economy was likely to recover continuously across every 
economic sector. East Asian econom ies picked up, while ASEAN economies 
were likely to moderate on the back of softer domestic demand. 
The Thai economy in 2013 Q3 was ex pected to expand compared to the 
same period of last year, similar to the pr evious quarter, thanks to the recovery in 
exports and strong growth in the service se ctor related to tourism. Nevertheless, 
domestic demand continued to moderate in line with softer private consumption 
as households spent more  cautiously on the ba ck of higher household debt 
burden, while support from fiscal stimul us declined. As a consequence, overall 
manufacturing production c ontinued to contract.

continue to expand from  improving economic 
fundamentals, particularly in the housing sector 
where recovery was more concrete (Chart 2.2) . This 
would benefit households’ fi nancial position and help 
support consumption in futu re periods. Nevertheless, 
impacts from the sequestrat ion, which came into 
effect in March, were expected to have a more 
notable effect on the US economy.  
Monetary policy in the US remained 
accommodative. In t he September 17-18, 2013 
meeting, the FOMC voted to  hold the policy rate at  
0-0.25 percent per annum and maintained the size of 
asset purchases at a pace of 85 billion US dollars  
per month1/ citing the following reasons for no 
tapering: (1) Economic data did not signify that the 
economy was as strong as the FOMC expected.  
(2) There were concerns that rapid tightening of 
financial conditions due to in vestors’ anticipation of 
the Fed’s tapering would sl ow the pace of economic 
improvement. And (3) higher fiscal uncertainty.  
The MPC assessed that going forward,  
the US economy was likely to improve gradually, 
supported by continued im provements in economic 
fundamentals, despite reduc ed government spending 
which would be a key constr aint on economic growth. 
Impacts from the partial government shutdown, which 
started on October 1, 2013, on the US economy 
would depend on the duration of the shutdown. 
However, according to hist orical data, the impact of 
the shutdown on the over all economy would not be 
substantial2/ because government agencies that

mortgage-backed securities of 45 and 40 billion US dollars

2/ The Bureau of Economic Anal ysis (BEA) and Congressional 
Budget Office (CBO) assessed that the 20 day  government 
shutdown in 1995 Q4 reduced economic growth between 
0.3 to 0.5 percent (qoq saar) in that quarter. 50100150200250

deliberations on the debt ceiling remained a risk factor that would render monitori ng. In this connection,  
to compensate for the debt  ceiling increase, US 
authorities could reduce t he budget further, which 
could cause greater fiscal drag going forward. 
In 2013 Q2, euro area economies
3/ expanded 
by 0.3 percent on a quarte r-on-quarter, seasonally 
adjusted basis, after contra cting for six consecutive 
quarters. The expansion was mainly attributable to 
growth in exports and domestic demand (Chart 2.3) .  
In 2013 Q3, euro area economies were 
expected to continue expandi ng from the previous 
quarter, as reflected by continuous improvements in 
the economic sentiment indicator of euro area 
economies, whereby the composite output PMI 
showed positive growth fo r the third consecutive 
month (Chart 2.4). This was in spite of contractions 
in manufacturing producti on and exports of 1.1 and 
1.6 percent (mom sa) in July, respectively. 
As for Germany, given a high possibility that 
Angela Merkel would be el ected as Chancellor for 
another term as her party  won the German federal 
election in September, Ge rmany’s policy towards 
Europe, which urged euro mem ber countries to carry 
out structural reforms, s hould continue in the same 
direction as before.

Source: Bloomberg28                          Monetary Policy Report October 2013   Going forward, the MP C evaluated that euro 
area economies would expand gradually, thanks to 
(1) a revival in business sentiment, (2) expansion in 
consumption of major c ountries, in particular 
Germany, on the back of strong labor market 
conditions and (3) lower fiscal drag. Nevertheless, 
the economic recovery w ould be at a slow pace due 
to deleveraging in both the private and public sectors, 
also most countries w ould still be faced with 
structural problems which would take time to address.  
The Japanese economy cont inued to recover, 
thanks to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s economic stimulus measures (Abenom ics). The recovery was 
supported by a pickup in  public investment and 
exports following economic recovery in Japan’s main trading partners, while pr ivate consumption showed 
signs of improvement.  
In 2013 Q2, the Japanese economy continued 
to recover from the previous quarter (Chart 2.5) , 
mainly supported by priv ate consumption and public 
investments under Abenomics’  stimulus measures to 
repair and reconstruct buildings damaged by  
the 2011 earthquake and recondition obsolete 
infrastructures. By product, these stimulus measures 
also caused the yen to weaken which helped boost 
Japan’s exports in the previ ous periods considerably. 
Meanwhile, manufacturing production was expected 
to recover gradually, as reflected by the Manufacturing 
Production Index, which on average increased from 
the previous quarter.
  
The Japanese economy should continue to 
recover in 2013 Q3. Nonetheless, growth could 
moderate from the first half of the year during which 
the economy picked up rat her significantly. The 
slower growth in the latter half of the year could be 
attributable to uncertain ties about the imminent 
consumption tax hike and about additional stimulus -2-1012

economy. 
Looking ahead, the MPC appraised that the 
Japanese economy would continue to expand, supported mainly by private consumption, public 
stimulus spending, privat e investment and exports, 
which were expected to pick up in line with the economic recovery of major trading partners. 
However, risks to Japan’s economic growth going 
forward would hinge on impacts from the consumption tax hike in April 2014. If supporting 
measures were inadequate and global economic 
recovery was not concrete enough, Japan’s export sector could be affected in the periods to come. 
The Chinese economy was expected to 
recover continuously. East  Asian economies picked 
up, while ASEAN economies we re likely to moderate 
from weaker domestic demand momentum. 
In 2013 Q2, the Chinese economy grew by 
7.5 percent, slowing down from  7.7 percent in the first 
quarter, due mainly to subdued exports. Economic 
activities improved acro ss the board in 2013 Q3 
(Table 2.1) . The continuous pickup in exports, in 
tandem with the global economic recovery, led 
manufacturing production to accelerate from the previous quarter. Meanwhile, investment, an 
important driver of econom ic growth, also picked up 
its pace thanks to accele rated infrastructure 
investments by the public sector and an acceleration 
in investments of the m anufacturing sector after 
having moderated for many successive months.  
Looking ahead, the MPC appr aised that in the 
latter half of 2013, the Chinese economy would 
improve from the first half of the year. This was supported by a pickup in domestic demand, 
especially investments in  infrastructure and the 
manufacturing sector which recovered in line with exports as well as the pi ckup in producer confidence 30                          Monetary Policy Report October 2013   and continued improvements in  business performance. 
Meanwhile, exports were expected to improve 
gradually in line with economic recovery of main 
trading partners.  
 
  
 
  
 
  
In 2013 Q2, growth varied among countries in 
the Asian region (Chart 2.6) . Growth of East Asian 
economies accelerated from the first quarter, driven by continued recovery in net exports and a pickup in 
domestic demand thanks to pub lic stimulus measures. 
Meanwhile, ASEAN economies moderated in line with softer domestic demand and slow export recovery. In 
2013 Q3, economic activities of North Asian countries 
should continue to expand on the back of strong 
domestic demand which had gained momentum, as 
well as exports following recovery of the global 
economy. With regard to ASEAN nations in the third quarter, economic activiti es slowed down in tandem 
with investment and consum ption, which was partly 
due to public policies in some  countries that aimed to 
restore economic stability. In particular, Indonesia 
and Malaysia which reduced s ubsidies on fuel prices. 
Meanwhile, exports were expected to recover slowly in line with economic reco very in G3 countries and 
China. Nonetheless, countri es with a high share of Table 2.1 China’s economic indicators (2013)

commodity prices.  
Going forward, the MPC appraised that 
regional economic growth would remain stable despite continuous improv ements in East Asian 
economies following recovery in exports, particularly 
in electronics. This was because ASEAN economies were expected to slow down in tandem with softening 
domestic demand owing partly to public policies 
implemented by some count ries which aimed to 
maintain monetary, fisca l and balance of payment 
stability. Examples include curbing subsidies on fuel 
prices in Malaysia and Indonesia, and delaying 
infrastructure investments that are high in machinery 
and equipment imports in Malaysia. Moreover, 
ASEAN exports were likely to recover slowly in line with global economic reco very and persistently low 
commodity prices.
 
2.2 The domestic economy   
In 2013 Q2, the Thai economy expanded at a 
slower rate compared to the same period last year due to softer demand, both domestic and foreign, 
which led to contractions in manufacturing production. 
Nevertheless, the servic e sector expanded strongly 
thanks to continued increas es in the number of 
foreign tourists. 
Economic conditions in 2013 Q2 
In 2013 Q2, the Thai economy grew year-on 
year by 2.8 percent (Chart 2.7) , slowing down from 
5.4 percent in the previ ous quarter. Softer domestic 
demand led activities in the trade and construction 
sectors to also slow down. At the same time, foreign 
demand had not yet fully recovered, resulting in 
contractions in manufactu ring production. Nonetheless, -10-505101520

expand strongly from the previous quarter.   
Manufacturing production contracted year-
on-year by 1.0 percent due to  the fact that foreign 
demand had not yet fully recovered and thus could 
not offset the decline in production caused by weak 
domestic demand.  Moreover, some industries were further affected by extraordinary factors which led 
production to continue to dec line from the previous 
quarter. Particularly, produc tion of hard disk drives, 
which were a main component in personal 
computers, steadily dec lined partly due to changing 
consumers’ preference from  personal computers to 
tablets and smartphones. M eanwhile, production of 
frozen food also decreased because of the problem 
of shrimp supply shor tage which had not yet 
subsided. Petroleum production also fell due to 
temporary closures of re fineries for maintenance. 
Nevertheless, automobile  production continued to 
expand, although slowing down somewhat as 
deliveries of cars under the first-car tax rebate 
scheme were nearly filled, while new orders declined. 
The service sector  expanded year-on-year 
by 7.5 percent, accelerating s lightly from the previous 
quarter. The acceleration was driven by continued growth in tourism, which led to a strong expansion in 
activities in the hotel  and restaurant sector. 
Nonetheless, activities in  the trade and transportation 
sectors moderated in line with domestic demand, 
consistent with lower manufacturing production. 
Activities in the construc tion sector also slowed down 
due mainly to labor shor tage problems that caused 
delays in private sector construction. Meanwhile, 
construction of the cent ral and local governments 
also contracted, as re flected by a decline in 
disbursements of public invest ment in construction.   
   Monetary Policy Report October 2013                       33 Agricultural production  overall was similar 
to the same period of last year. Rubber and palm oil 
outputs continued to expand strongly following 
expansion of the planting areas many years ago. In 
contrast, rice output dec lined considerably, due to 
unfavorable weather conditions and a high base 
effect from an increase in rice cultivation in 2012 to compensate for damages made by the 2011 floods. 
In addition, fishery produc tion continued to contract 
as a result of a substantia l decline in shrimp output 
due to the continued outbreak  of the early mortality 
syndrome (EMS). 
Demand in 2013 Q2 expanded at a slower 
rate than the previous quarter, owing to the slow 
recovery in private consumption and investment, 
public investment and merchandi se exports, in line 
with fragile foreign demand and consistent with the 
decline in manufactu ring production. 
Private consumption expanded year-on-year 
by 2.4 percent (Table 2.2) , decelerating from the 
previous quarter due to lower demand for durable 
goods, especially automobile s, as households had 
frontloaded their car purchas es to take advantage of 
the first-car tax rebate sc heme, as well as higher debt 
burden which led households to spend more cautiously. Nevertheless, consumption in non-durable 
goods and services increased. Private investment  
expanded by 1.9 percent year-on-year, slowing from the previous quarter. The slowdown was on account 
of a deceleration in machinery and equipment 
investments after having in creased substantially last 
year to replace and repair flood-related damages. 
Furthermore, softening domestic and foreign demand 
led some businesses to postpone their investment plans. Investment in cons truction also moderated on 
the back of a slowdown in factory and commercial 
building construction.

Exports of goods and services  expanded 
by 2.8 percent, slowing down from the previous 
quarter in line with weakening foreign demand. The slowdown was due to the decline in exports of 
manufacturing products, parti cularly in electronics 
and electrical appliances, as  well as in agricultural 
products, especially rubber . Exports of fishery 
products decreased due to t he disease outbreak in 
shrimps. Rice exports fell following deteriorating price competitiveness, while expor ts of petroleum products 
contracted due to temporary cl osures of refineries for 
maintenance. Nevertheless, exports of services  
expanded in line with conti nuous increases in the 
number of foreign tourists, particularly from China, 
Malaysia and Russia. However, freight and transport receipts declined in tandem with lower international 
trade volume.
      
Sluggish domestic demand and merchandise 
exports caused imports of goods and services  to 
slow down from the previous quarter, with a growth 
rate of 4.1 percent. The slowdown was attributed to a deceleration in imports of  consumer goods, capital 
goods, as well as raw materials and intermediate 
goods (exclude crude oil). Ne vertheless, imports of 
crude oil increased in line with domestic needs. Table 2.2  GDP growth rate

previous quarter, owing to an increase in travel 
expenditures consistent wi th the rising number of 
Thais travelling abroad. However, freight payments fell in line with international trade volume. 
Fiscal spending  picked up pace owing to an 
increase in expenditures on employee compensation and purchases of goods and services. Public 
investments moderated due to delays in disbursements 
by local governments and disbursements under  the Emergency Decree on Water Management. 
Nevertheless, disbursements on investments by 
state-owned enterprises we re at normal levels. 
The economic outlook for 2013 Q3
4/ 
In 2013 Q3, the Thai economy was likely to 
expand from the same period last year, supported by exports which had started to recover. Meanwhile, 
domestic demand would cont inue to soften in line 
with private consumpt ion and public spending.  
As a consequence, overa ll manufacturing production 
would continue to contract from the previous quarter, 
despite some signs of improvement in export-oriented production. The unimproved outlook for 
manufacturing production c oupled with lower public 
stimulus led to the expectati on that private investment 
                                                        
4/  Economic indicators used in assessing the outlook for 2013 Q2 
were produced by the Bank of Thailand, except data on the 
Manufacturing Production Index  and capacity utilization 
rate, which were provided by the Office of Industrial 
Economics. The number of t ourists and occupancy rate 
were, in part, compiled by the T ourism Authority of Thailand. 
Data on the labor market were obtained by the National 
Statistical Office. The government expenditure data  
were provided by the Comptroller General’s Department,  and compiled by the Fiscal Policy Office, Ministry of 
Finance. The ec onomic outlook was obtained from the 
Economic/Business Information Exchange Program betw een 
the Bank of Thailand and the business sector. 36                          Monetary Policy Report October 2013   would expand at a low rate similar to that in the 
previous quarter, sustained by earlier investment 
plans. Nonetheless, the tour ism sector continued to 
expand favorably. As a result, activities in the relating 
fields of the service sect or were also expected to 
expand strongly.  
Manufacturing production  in the third 
quarter was expected to contract from the same 
period last year, but to a lesser extent than the 
previous quarter, consis tent with the capacity 
utilization rate (Chart 2.8).  The lower contraction in 
manufacturing production st emmed from a more 
concrete recovery in foreign demand, which was likely to shore up export- oriented production. Hard 
disk drive production was likely to remain stable in 
this quarter, despite lower global demand due to consumers’ change in pr eference. Meanwhile, 
production of processed and frozen foods should 
contract at a lower rate t hanks to gradual subsiding of 
the shrimp supply short age problem, as well as 
improvements in chicken production as a major 
producer, who previously had financial liquidity problems, had started to resume production. 
Production of apparels increased following a return in 
orders from key trading partners, while petroleum production was likely to increase with higher foreign 
demand due to closures of refineries for maintenance 
in some countries.  
However, because dom estic demand remained 
weak, domestic-oriented production was likely to 
soften, in particular automobile production which contracted on the back of a substantial decline in new 
orders while back orders had already been filled as

The service sector  in the third quarter was 
expected to expand from the same period last year 
and would provide a key growth driver of GDP this 
quarter on the production si de. Continued expansion 
in tourism was reflected by  the number of tourists, 
particularly from China, Malaysia and Russia, as well 
as from Muslim countri es, in July and August  
which continued to increase  (Chart 2.10) . As a 
consequence, relating se rvices also expanded 
robustly, especially in the hotel and restaurant sector. 
The expansion in tourism also helped support 
activities in the trade and transport sectors to 
continue to expand, espec ially during times when 
manufacturing and agricultu ral production were still 
contracting. Nevertheless, acti vities in the real estate 
and construction sectors were likely to soften slightly, 
in line with a slowdown in public investment in 
construction which encount ered both contractor and 
labor shortage problems. 
Agricultural production  in the third quarter 
was likely to contract from the same period last year, 
due mainly to a decline in ri ce output as a result of 
unfavorable weather conditi ons, coupled with a high 
base effect from an increase in last year’s rice 
cultivation to compensat e for those damaged by the 
2011 floods. Nevertheless, rubber and palm oil 
outputs were expected to increase following 
expansions in the planti ng areas in the past few 
years. 
Although overall manufacturing production 
had not yet shown clear signs of improvement, economic activities in some sectors picked up 
continually. Moreover, due to tight labor market 
conditions during these pas t few years, labor demand 
remained high. As a result, the unemployment rate in 4045505560657075

level, despite a slight increase in July (Chart 2.11)  
which had not flagged a concern.  Part of the rise in 
unemployment was due to an increase in new entry to the labor force by people who had never worked 
before. The rise in unemployment against the 
backdrop of strong labor demand reflected a mismatch between the sk ills and qualifications 
possessed by existing labors and those required by 
the market.  
On the demand side, in 2013 Q3, domestic 
spending was expected to expand at a lower rate,  
in line with private cons umption as well as public 
spending which provided le ss stimulus to the 
economy. Private invest ment was expected to 
expand close to the previous quarter’s level. Meanwhile, exports show ed signs of a pickup, 
supported by recovery in foreign demand.  
Private consumption  was expected to 
moderate compared to the same period last year  
due to a decline in durable consumption from the 
previous year (Chart 2.12) . The decline in durable 
consumption followed a slowdown in automobile 
purchases after having acce lerated in the previous 
periods, coupled with more  cautious spending by 
households given high debt burden, while financial 
institutions also ti ghtened standards on household 
loans. Nonetheless, non- durable consumption 
continued to expand, s upported by favorable 
employment conditions and household income, both 
farm and non-farm, which would be conducive to spending. 
Private investment  was expected to grow at  
a rate similar to the previous quarter, in line with an expansion in construction sect or investment, especially 
commercial construction, both within and outside the 
municipality of major provinces (Chart 2.13) . This was 
in part to accommodate higher investment demand 0.00.20.40.60.81.01.2

needs to invest for m anual labor replacement in 
response to labor s hortages and to enhance 
productivity in accordance wi th their original plans. 
This was consistent with  opinions expressed by 
entrepreneurs under the Business Liaison Program 
between the Bank of T hailand and the business 
sector, and was reflected by the high level  of investment promotion certificates issued by  
the Board of Investment (BOI). Nonetheless, some 
entrepreneurs might delay their investments in order to wait to assess the economic situation. 
Exports of goods were expected to expand 
from the same period last y ear, thanks to recovery in 
foreign demand (Chart 2.14) . Expansions would be 
observed in the exports of major manufacturing 
products, including automobile s, integrated circuits 
and parts, petroleum products and apparels. 
Meanwhile, exports of fishery and agricultural 
products were likely to moderate due to shrimp supply shortages for fr ozen seafood production and  
a decline in rice exports following deteriorating price 
competitiveness. Nevertheless, exports of services  
were expected to expand, prompted by an increase 
in the number of foreign t ourists from almost all 
regions, in particular those from China, Malaysia and 
Russia.     
Imports of goods were likely to expand from 
the same period last year (Chart 2.15) , in particular 
imports of capital goods, raw materials and 
intermediate goods, consist ent with expansions  
in private investment and merchandise exports. However, imports of c onsumer goods, especially

Public stimulus would continue, supported 
by expenditures on wages and salaries, and 
purchases of goods and serv ices, as well as strong 
investment growth by state-owned enterprises. 
Nevertheless, when combined with relatively low 
central budget disbursement s, as well as capital 
budget disbursement delays in  some projects due to 
contractor procurement and construction worker 
shortage problems, and dis bursement delays in the 
water management project following the Court’s ruling that a public heari ng must be sought on the 
projects, overall fiscal st imulus softened compared to

would expand in line with exports of goods and 
services, while domestic spending, in particular private consumption and public spending, softened. 
2.3 Costs and prices  
 Inflation 
Headline inflation in 2013 Q3 stood at 1.67 
percent, down from 2.32 per cent in the previous 
quarter (Chart 2.17)  due to softer prices across the 
board. Energy prices in 2013 Q3 expanded year-on-
year by 3.67 percent, decelerating from 4.60 percent observed in the previous quarter. The slowdown  
was prompted by a high base effect following a 
substantial increase in the Ft rate in the same period of last year. Nevertheless, compared to the previous 
quarter, energy prices continued to increase (Table 
2.3), owing to higher domestic retail oil prices 
following world crude oil prices which rose from tight 050100150200250300350

Prices of raw food rose year-on-year by 4.48

 Core inflation in 2013 Q3 stood at 0.74 
percent, slowing down from 1.00 percent in the 
previous quarter (Chart 2.18),  owing mainly to low 
production costs, as well as sluggish domestic 
demand which limited upward price adjustments of 
goods and services. In particular, (1) price of prepared foods declined in line with raw material 
costs. Although household LPG price gradually 
increased in September, cost pass-through was limited; (2) price of the hous ing and furniture category

contractions in durable g oods consumption; and (3) 
price of transportation stabilized in line with stable 
transportation fares given that energy costs did not change significantly as aut horities continued to peg 
domestic retail diesel pr ices and subsidize public 
transportation fares. Moreover, the slowdown in core inflation was also due to a high base effect in the 
price of the tobacco and alcoholic beverages 
category which rose significantly in the same period of last year following an increase in excise tax on 
alcohol and tobacco (Table 2.3) . 
Production cost conditions In 2013 Q3, the Producer Price Index 
expanded by 0.4 percent, st abilizing at a low level, 
similar to the previous quarter, reflecting that overall 
production costs continued to remain low (Chart 
2.19). Price of agricultural products softened, 
especially that of vegetab les and fruits, which due  
an increase in output. Meanwhile, the price of 
manufactured products accele rated, owing mainly to 
an increase in the price of petroleum products following world crude oil prices which increased from 
tight oil supply problems due to the unrest in Syria 
and higher demand following global economic recovery. Moreover, the weakening of the baht  
from previous periods also led to higher costs of 
imported oil.    
Inflationary pressure in the periods ahead 
Inflationary pressure, overall, would remain 
low. Although cost pressure was poised to increase gradually from the current level, pass-through of 
costs to prices would remain limited, owing to low 
domestic demand pressure and stable inflation expectations.

3.1 Financial markets 
Money market rates remained stable in line 
with the policy interest rate. Meanwhile, government 
bond yields were somewhat volatile owing mainly to 
investors’ demand for bonds, expectation on the Fed’s QE tapering and bond supply factors. 
Money and bond markets 
In 2013 Q3, short-term money market rates 
remained stable and close to the policy interest rate, 
in line with the MPC’s dec ision to hold the policy 
interest rate at 2.50 perc ent per annum at the July  
9-10 and August 21, 2013 meetings. The overnight 
interbank lending rate and the one-month government bond yield stood at 2.40 and 2.50 percent per annum 
at the end of the third quarte r, respectively. Subsequently, 
at the October 16, 2013 m eeting, the MPC continued Thailand’s overall economic and fina ncial stability continued to be 
well maintained. Money market interest  rates remained stable in line with 
the policy interest rate. Meanwhile, financ ial health of financial institutions 
remained strong. Overall stability in t he non-financial inst itution sector was 
intact, with household income and empl oyment remaining high. Concerns 
over an eventual tapering of QE in the US caused financ ial markets, both 
the foreign exchange and equity markets, to become more volatile during 
2013 Q3. Moreover, the economic slowdown started to have an impact on corporate sector profitability. 
Risks that needed to be monitored going forwad included 
1) uncertainties in the global economy which could lead to sudden capital 
outflow and financial market volatilit y; and 2) impacts of the domestic 
economic slowdown on househol d income and corporat e profitability, which 
could in turn worsen future debt serv icing ability of the private sector and 
credit quality of financ ial institutions.

(Chart 3.1) .  
Short-term government bond yields in 2013 Q3 
edged lower in line with an increase in demand by 
both domestic and foreign investors, while waiting for more clarity on the Fed’s QE tapering. Meanwhile, 
medium to long-term government bond yields were 
somewhat volatile, trending upwards in July to mid-
September in line with US government bond yields 
which increased after US GDP figures came out 
better than expected, leading investors to expect higher possibility that the Fed would begin QE 
tapering in September 2013. During the rest of the 
quarter, however, medium- to long-term government bond yields declined followi ng the Fed’s decision  
on the September 17-18 meeting to maintain QE 
measures at the current le vel, a move unexpected by 
the market. A final factor behind the movements of 
medium to long-term bond yields was the Ministry of 
Finance’s auction announcem ent of government 
bonds in 2013 Q4 with smaller-than-expected amount 
of bonds, which resulted in a return of investors’ 
interest in medium to long-term government bonds (Chart 3.2) .  
Equity market 
In 2013 Q3, the Stock Exchange of Thailand 
(SET) index remained highly volatile. Since the start 
of the quarter, the SET index had been trending 
downwards due to concerns over the Fed’s QE tapering. However, the Fed decided to maintain its 
QE measures at the Se ptember 18, 2013 meeting 
due to unclear signs regarding US’ economic strength. Moreover, concer ns over tight monetary 
conditions and fiscal risks in the US led foreign 
investors to return to the Asian region, including Thailand, causing a slight increase in the SET index. 2.402.602.803.003.203.403.603.804.004.204.40

might begin QE tapering at the October meeting,  
the SET index began to resume its downward path. 
In this regard, accumula ted net sales by foreign 
investors in July to Septem ber of this year totaled  
30 billion baht  (Chart 3.3) .  
A key risk to be monitored in the periods 
ahead included the economic recovery in major 
countries, particularly in t he US which could lead  
the Fed to taper QE measur es in the future, causing 
sudden capital outflows from emerging market 
economies, which could in turn lead to an increase  
in capital market volatility.  
Foreign exchange market 
At the end of 2013 Q3, the Thai baht stood 
at 31.29 baht per US dollar, depreciating by 0.85 percent from the end of the previous quarter 
(Chart 3.4).  During the first half of the quarter, the 
Thai baht remained relatively stable compared to the previous quarter where a persistent appreciation was 
noted most of the quarter.  Nonetheless, during the 
latter half of the quarter, the Thai baht became 
rather volatile and depreciated strongly during 
mid-August to early September . The Thai baht 
depreciated to the weakest level in three years to close at 32.39 baht per US  dollar on September 6, 
2013, due to disappointing T hai economic figures  
in 2013 Q2, weaker regi onal economic stability 
especially in India and I ndonesia, and the market’s 
expectation that the Fed would taper off QE 
measures in September following the release of 
FOMC minutes on August 21, 2013. After that,  the 
Thai baht resumed its appreciating trend till the 
end of the quarter,  owing to lower-than-expected 
US economic figures, dimini shed concerns regarding 
the unrest situation in Syri a, and most importantly,

In 2013 Q3, deposit rates on both normal 
time deposits and special deposit products edged up 
slightly from the previous quarter, partly due to high 
competition for deposits between commercial banks 
and SFIs to support continued growth in private credits. Meanwhile, private credit and deposit growth

Large commercial banks’2/ deposit rates in 
2013 Q3 edged up marginally from the previous 
quarter, whereby at the end of the quarter, interest rates on the 12-month deposits of the four largest 
commercial banks stood at 2.45 percent per annum, 
increasing from 2.40 percent  at the end of the last 
quarter due to an upward adjustment of interest rates 
by some commercial ban ks for large depositors. 
In addition, many commercial banks and 
SFIs such as the Govern ment Savings Bank, the 
Government Housing Bank, and Bank for Agriculture 
and Agricultural Cooperatives, became more aggressive in terms of competing for deposits in this 
quarter, partly to support continued growth in private 
credits. This observation was reflected by increases in interest rates on existing special deposit products 
together with launches of new special deposit 
products which paid higher interest rates than those of normal time deposits.  
Meanwhile, the average MLR of the four 
largest commercial banks remained unchanged from the previous quarter, standi ng at 7.00 percent per 
annum.  
Private credits at end-August 2013 grew 11.9 
percent from the same peri od last year, decelerating 
from 12.9 percent in the previous quarter (Chart 3.6) . 
The slowdown in private credits was attributed to both household and corporate loans. The slowdown 
in consumer loans was due in part to an increase

201150    Monetary Policy Report  October 2013  end-September 2013 revealed that demand for 
private credits was set to continue to increase going 
forward, both in corporate and household loans. 
However, financial institut ions became more cautious 
in loan approval, especially in auto leasing and other 
personal loans. 
Deposits and bills of exchange (B/E) at end-
August 2013 expanded by 8.1 percent from the same 
period last year, continuing to slow down from the 
previous quarter which stood at 10.4 percent. The 
slowdown in deposits and B/E was apparent in all 
deposit products and from  both corporate and 
households, partly because depositors switched to 
invest in other financial assets. As such, the slower 
growth in deposits and B/E, compared with that in 
private credits, led to a persistent increase in the Loan to Deposit and B/E ratio from 93.4 percent at 
the end of 2013 Q1, to 95.3 percent at the end of 
2013 Q2, and to 95.7 percent at end-August 2013. Looking ahead, competition for deposits was expected 
to continue, as reflected by the relatively high interest 
rates of special deposit pr oducts. High competition in 
deposit mobilization was in part to support continued 
growth in demand for credits of both the private and 
public sectors, as well as to support financial institutions’ need to maintain liquidity in times of  
a highly volatile global financial environment. 
Stability of financial institutions  
The overall stability of fi nancial institutions in 
2013 Q2 remained sound, as reflected by strong 
profitability, high capita l adequacy ratio and healthy 
asset quality. 
Commercial banks continued to pose strong 
profitability in 2013 Q2 wher eby net profit increased 
from 52.1 billion baht in the previous quarter to 58.1 
billion baht (Table 3.1) . The increase in profitability 
was attributable to higher in terest income, as well as 
one-off profit from the sale  of a subsidiary by a Monetary Policy Report  October 2013         51 particular commercial bank. However, excluding this 
one-off profit, net profit of commercial banks overall 
would decline by 6.6 perc ent from the previous 
quarter to stand at 45.8 billion baht. The decline in profitability was partly due to an increase in 
provisioning for bad and doubtful loans given 
heightened uncertainties in  the economic outlook. 
Despite this fact, commercia l banks’ capital remained 
strong and even though the ratio of capital adequacy 
at the end of 2013 Q2 ed ged down slightly from the 
previous quarter to regi ster at 15.7 percent, it 
remained far greater than the minimum legal 
requirement of 8.5 percent. In addition, loan quality remained intact, as reflected by the delinquency and 
NPL ratios of private cr edits which continued to 
stabilize at a low le vel of 5.3 percent (Chart 3.7) . 
Nonetheless, liquidity in t he banking sector tightened 
slightly, as reflected by  an increase in the Loan  
to Deposit and B/E ratio that had been rising continuously, mainly due to high credit growth. 
Going forward, key risks that would warrant 
close monitoring included domestic and global economic outlook, particularl y the slowdown in the 
Thai economy that could a ffect the private sector’s 
debt servicing ability and, hence, loan quality in the 
next periods. 
3.3 Non-financial sectors 
Stability in non-financial sectors remained 
intact overall. Household income and employment 
were high. However, the slowing economy that 
began to affect corporate profitability could pose a 
threat to debt servicing abilities of households and 
corporates in the periods ahead.

Stability of the household sector remained 
sound, with high levels  of employment and 
household income. Debt servicing ability also stayed intact, though risks could increase from an economic 
slowdown. 
Household income and employment remained 
high, as reflected by the rising average income  
in both farm and non-farm sectors (Chart 3.8) . 
Employment conditions cont inued to be favorable,  
as indicated by the low seasonally-adjusted 
unemployment rate of 0.9 per cent in July 2013. With 
regard to household debt, the ratio of household loans (provided by financia l institutions) to GDP 
increased from 77.6 percent  at end-2013 Q1 to 79.2 
percent at the end of the second quarter due to the economic slowdown. Househol d liquidity tightened, 
as reflected by a small decline in the ratio of 
household financial assets to debt from the previous quarter to 209.4 at end-2013 Q2 (Chart 3.9) . 
However, although household loans continued to 
exhibit strong growth, they were likely to be on  a declining trend, falling from  16.2 in 2013 Q1 to 15.7 
percent in 2013 Q2 (Chart 3.10).  
Meanwhile, debt servicing ability of households 
remained sound, as reflec ted by a low delinquency 
and NPL ratio despite a s light increase from 4.9 
percent at the end of 2013 Q1 to 5.2 percent at the 
end of 2013 Q2, which was mainly attributed to auto 
leasing. Households’ debt se rvicing ability would thus 
be closely monitored in th e periods ahead, especially 
if the Thai economy continued to slow down and affect 
household income.

2013 Monetary Policy Report  October 2013         53 Corporate sector 
Corporate profitability in 2013 Q2 declined 
slightly from the previous quarter due to an increase 
in production costs, causi ng debt servicing ability of 
corporates to weaken overa ll. Nevertheless, liquidity 
and debt burden remained intact. 
Corporate profitability in 2013 Q2 declined 
slightly owing to higher production costs, particularly 
in the real estate sector where wages and 
construction material costs increased significantly, while sales grew at a rate similar to the previous 
quarter. As a result, corporate profitability, as 
reflected by the Operating Profit Margin (OPM) fell from 6.4 percent in the previous quarter to 5.9 
percent at the end of 2013 Q2 (Table 3.1).  
In particular, profitability of the real estate and wholesale and retail sectors had declined for  
the second consecutive quarter. Nevertheless, 
profitability of t he construction sector, in particular 
construction companies in the real estate sector,  
increased quite significant ly from the previous 
quarter, thanks to pent-up demand for condominium construction (Chart 3.11).  Meanwhile, debt servicing 
ability of the corporate se ctor weakened slightly  
in 2013 Q2, as reflected by a reduction in the Interest Coverage Ratio (ICR) from 3.4 at the end of last 
quarter to 3.1 at the end of 2013 Q2. In this connection, 
there was a significant decr ease in the real estate 
sector’s ICR, from 4.2 at the end of last quarter to 3.0 
(Chart 3.12).  Nevertheless, liquidity and debt burden 
remained intact, as reflected by the Current Ratio (CR) and Debt to Equity Ratio (D/E) which stabilized 
at 1.5 and 0.8, respectively (Table 3.1).  
Looking ahead, key risks that required close 
monitoring included an event of QE tapering which 
could lead to higher Thai  baht volatility, and an 
economic slowdown which could hurt corporate 
profitability, going forward. 05101520

Stability in the real es tate sector remained 
sound overall. Market condi tions in Bangkok and its 
vicinities began to improve after slowing down in the previous periods. Nonetheless, risks that would 
render monitoring included the problem of labor 
shortages and rising costs of construction material 
which could affect developm ent of the real estate 
sector going forward, as well as a slowdown in the 
Thai economy which could affect housing demand in 
the periods ahead. 
Stability of the real estate sector remained 
sound, where market condi tions were likely to 
improve, both in terms of demand and supply, after 
having slowed down in the previous periods. On the 
demand side, the number of new mortgage approvals by commercial banks for properties  
in Bangkok and its vicinities began to increase  
in August 2013 (Chart 3.13).  Meanwhile, on the 
supply side, the number of  new openings for both 
low-rise housing and condominiums also began to 
increase after having slowed down in the previous periods (Chart 3.14).  In this regard, prices of most 
condominiums were still unde r 3 million baht per unit.  
Meanwhile, lending standards of commercial 
banks remained satisfactory. Some tightening of 
lending standards on new mo rtgages were starting to 
be observed, after having loosened somewhat during the beginning of the year. This was reflected by the 
debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) in August 2013 
of 4.7, which was higher t han the five-year’s average 
of 4.4 (Chart 3.15).   
Though stability remai ned sound overall, 
most entrepreneurs would still be faced with skilled 
labor shortage problems which would lead to delays 
in delivery, as well as persistent increases in 
construction costs even though some firms had already switched to use less expensive finished 0246810

would need to be monitored closely due to a likely 
economic slowdown whic h could affect housing 
demand going forward. 
Fiscal sector 
Stability in the fiscal sector continued to be 
well maintained. Nonetheless, the government’s spending plan, especially future quasi-fiscal and 
contingent expenditures, would need to be 
monitored. Furthermore, overall public debt was likely to increase in future periods.  
Stability in the fiscal sector was well 
maintained overall, as reflec ted by a slight decline in 
the public debt to GDP ratio of 44.3 percent at  
end-June 2013 to 44.1 percent at end-July 2013 
(Chart 3.16) , which was also lower than the fiscal 
sustainability threshold of 60 percent .  Nonetheless, 
government spending plans  would be closely 
monitored, in particular quasi-fiscal and contingent expenditures, such as pledging schemes on 
agricultural produce, which could eventually lead to 
higher public debt.  41.2

 58   Monetary Policy Report  October 2013  The evolution and outlook of Tha iland’s current account balance 
The evolution of Thailand’s current account balance  
Following the 1997 crisis, Thailand’s current account balance has continuously been in surplus, 
due mainly to the trade surpluses. This reversed from the pre-1997 period where the current account 
was persistently in deficit, on the back of rapidly increasing trade deficits following the economic 
expansion in Thailand, while imports for investments accelerated, particularly in 
the real estate sector where speculative 
investments were at a high level. In addition, these investments were mostly 
financed by foreign loans. As a 
consequence of speculative demand, asset prices went beyond their fundamental 
value, causing foreign investors to lose 
confidence in the Thai economy and led to attacks on the Thai baht. This was 
induced by the fact that Thailand 
liberalized its capital account while maintaining a fixed exchange rate regime, 
which eventually led to the economic 
crisis in 1997.  
From 2012 to 2013 Q2, the current account turned deficit once again, with the ratio of the 
current account deficit to GDP standing at 6.7 percent in 2013 Q2. This raises the question of whether 
the present current account deficit should be a cause for concern as in the past  (Chart 1) .    
Causes of the present current account deficits in Thailand 
The deficits in today’s current account balance are different from that prior to the 1997 
economic crisis, because this time the current account deficits are not a reflection of a heating economy or imbalances in economic fundamentals. The causes of the recent current account deficits in Thailand 
include the following.    
(1) An increase in net imports of gold following high returns on gold investment.   
In recent periods, net imports of 
gold increased in line with investment 
demand for gold which was partly due to low interest rates and the volatile stock 
market. However, as gold does not have 
any impacts on real economic activities, such as on manufacturing production and 
employment, when assessing economic 
stability from the current acc ount perspective, 
the current account excluding gold should 
be used. In this connection, when gold is 
excluded, the Thai current account balance remains in surplus, reflecting that Thailand’s 
overall competitiveness has not deteriorated 
much (Chart 2).

In 2013 Q2, earnings and remittances 
were higher than normal due to strong business performance in 2012, particularly in businesses 
relating to automobiles which benefited from  
the first-car tax rebate scheme. In addition, remittances of earnings and dividends back to 
parent companies abroad are normally high in the 
second and third quarter of each year (Chart 3).  
(3) An increase in reinvested earnings of 
foreign businesses, in line with last year’s strong 
business performance. 
Reinvested  earnings are considered 
payments under the services, income and 
transfers account. This increase in payments is, however, not of concern as foreign businesses reinvested their earnings back into Thailand and did not cause any changes to the overall balance of 
payments. 
Outlook for Thailand’s current account balance 
Thailand’s current account to GDP ratio for the remainder of 2013 is expected to face a lower 
deficit compared to that in the second quarter, due to anticipated improvements in the trade balance at year-end following the gradual global economic recovery. The services, income and transfers balance is 
also likely to experience a lower deficit thanks to continuous expansion in tourism receipts. In addition, 
remittances of earnings and dividends of foreign businesses are expected to decline, owing to lower business performance, especially those relating to automobiles, on account of waning effects from the 
first-car tax rebate scheme. Moreover, remittances of earnings and dividends are normally low in the 
last quarter of the year due to seasonal factors.  
In the long term, the dynamic of 
Thailand’s current account will be different 
from that of the past. In this regard, the current account is likely to record a deficit in response 
to a slower rate of global economic growth. In 
addition, Thailand’s competitiveness in some products, especially electronics, has declined, 
which will lead to a slower recovery for Thai 
exports compared to other countries in the region (Chart 4) . Meanwhile, imports are 
expected to expand following the government’s 
large infrastructure investment projects. Nevertheless, an important issue that should 
be considered when assessing whether Thailand’s current account deficit is an issue of concern, is the 
cause of the deficits. Should the deficit occur from factors that impart negative impacts on the real economy and financial sector--for example, if Thailand experienced excessive imports for consumption 
such that the country was faced with a higher debt burden due to reliance on foreign loans, while domestic 
investment is low—then it would be a cause of concern. Not only do these factors not lead to long-term development, but they also increase risks in financial stability and external stability. However, if the current 
account deficit is a result of extraordinary factors which occur temporarily such as in the current situation, 
while Thailand’s external stability remains sound, then the current account deficit may not be of great concern. Furthermore, Thailand is now under a managed floating exchange rate regime which allows 
flexible exchange rate and thus the current account to adjust in accordance with market mechanisms.  708090100110120130140
