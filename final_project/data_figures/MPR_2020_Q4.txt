Monetary Policy in Thailand  
Monetary Policy Committee  
Under the Bank of Thailand Act, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC ) comprises the governor 
and two deputy governors, as well as four distinguished external members representing various 
sectors of the economy, with the aim of ensuring  that monetary policy decisions are effective and 
transparent . 
Monetary Policy Objective   
The MPC implements monetary policy under the flexible inflation targeting regime . While regarding 
medium–term price stability as its primary objective, the MPC also aims at supporting sustainable, 
full-potential economic growth and preserving financial stability, attributing to long -term price stability  
and economic sustainability  
Monetary Policy Target  
On De cember  24, 2019, the Cabinet approved the monetary policy target for 2020, which was 
mutually agreed between the MPC and the Minister of Finance to set the headline inflation  within 
the range of 1 –3 percent as the target for the medium -term horizon and for  2020 . 
In the event that average headline inflation in the past 12 months or a forecast of average headline 
inflation over 12 months ahead breaches the target range, the MPC shall  send an open letter to 
the Minister of Finance to explain  reasons  for the br each of the target range,  together with 
measures taken and estimated time to bring inflation back to the target . In addition, the MPC will 
write an additional open letter to the Minister of Finance every six months if average headline 
inflation based on th e above criteria remains outside the target range . 
Monetary Policy Instrument  
The MPC utilizes the 1 -day bilateral repurchase transaction rate as the policy interest rate to signal 
the monetary policy stance . 
Evaluation of Economic Conditions and Forecast s  
The Bank of Thailand takes into account information from all sources, the macroeconomic model, 
data from each economic sector, as well as surveys  of large enterprises, together with  small and 
medium -sized enterprises from all over the country, and various financial institutions  to ensure that 
economic evaluations and forecasts are accurate and cover all aspects, both at the macro and 
micro levels . 
Monetary Policy Communication  
Recognizing the importance of monetary policy communication to the publi c, the MPC employs  
various  channels of communication, both in Thai and English, such as (1) organizing a press 
statement at 14 :00 on the day of the Committee meeting, (2) publishing edited minutes of the MPC 
meeting two weeks after the meeting, and (3) publishing the Monetary Policy Report  every quarter

Monetary Policy Conduct in the Fourth Quarter of 2020  
At the meetings on November 18 and December 23, 20201/, the Committee voted unanimously  
to maintain the policy rate at 0 .50 percent . The Committee projected that the Thai economy 
would see a smaller contraction in 2020 than previously assessed and continue to recover in  
2021 and 2022 . However, there could be adverse risks to the baseline projection . In particular,  
uncertainty  surrounding the COVID -19 situation  in the near term, as well as uncertainty regarding  
vaccine efficacy and vaccination  coverage which cou ld be limited, consequently affecting the 
progress in the admission of foreign tourists in the period ahead . In addition, uneven 
recoveries across economic sectors and areas would affect sustainability of economic growth 
going forward . The Committee assess ed that the economy still needed support from the 
continued low policy rate, and thus the limited policy space should be preserved for the 
appropriate and most effective timing . Under the monetary policy framework with objectives of 
maintaining price stability, supporting sustainable and full -potential economic growth, and 
preserving financial stability, the Committee continued to put emphasis on supporting economic 
recovery . The Committee would stand ready to use  additional appropriate monetary policy  tools 
if necessary .  
Going forward, the Committee assessed that the economic recovery would remain highly 
uncertain, and the continuity of government measures and policy coordination among 
government agencies would therefore be critical  in supporting econ omic recovery . 
Uneven recoveries resulted in limited access to credit for  some businesses . Thus, financial 
institutions should expedite debt restructuring and credit extension under various measures, 
for example,  credit guarantee schemes . The Committee als o viewed  that fiscal measures 
would continue to play a crucial role in sustaining the economy amid high uncertainties . 
Moreover, the Committee  assessed that  the COVID -19 pandemic would cause some scarring 
effects on Thailand ’s economic growth potential in the long term . Therefore,  structural reforms 
would be  needed and should be  accelerated  alongside  demand -management stimulus measures  
to boost economic recovery in the short term . 
Assessment of the Economic and Financial Outlook as the Basis for Policy Formulation  
1. Global Economy  
The global economy would contract in 2020 by less than the previous assessment  due to 
the recovery in global economic activities since the third quarter  after the relaxation of outbreak 
containment measures . Looking ahead, trading partner economies would  pick up as the 
pandemic subsided . Effective COVID -19 vaccines coupled with extensive vaccination coverage,  
ongoing fiscal measures and accommodative monetary policy would support economic  recovery 
in the period ahead . The Committee assessed  that Thailand ’s trading partner economies 
would contract by 3 .8 percent in 2020, before expanding by 4 .8 and 3 .1 percent in 2021 
and 2022, respectively . Risks to trading partners ’ growth remained tilted to the downside, 
albeit less so th an the previous assessment,  thanks to the higher -than-expected vaccine 
                                                             
1// At the meeting on December 23, 2020, one MPC member was  absent .   
Monetary Policy Report  December 2020                                                                                                                      6 efficacy and vaccination coverage, and  the positive outlook  regarding the new U .S. president ’s 
international trade policy, that supported global trade sentiment . 
Governments worldwide c ontinued to implement fiscal measures, with some countries 
announcing economic recovery packages, to alleviate short -term and long -term  economic 
impacts of the COVID -19 pandemic . At the same time, central banks in major advanced 
economies continued to maintain accommodative monetary policy, including both quantitative 
easing and low policy rates . The European Central Bank announced further expansions of  
asset purchases  programs . Meanwhile, some regional central banks  further cut their policy rates , 
such  as the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), and Bank Indonesia (BI). 
2. Financial Conditions and Financial Stability  
Overall financial conditions in Thailand remained accommodative . Short -term interest 
rates  in financial markets remained  at low levels consi stent with the policy rate . Meanwhile,  
long-term government bond yields declined slightly as a result of higher demand in long -term 
government bonds . The new loan rates  (NLR) edged up for some business sectors, owing 
partly  to the slowdown in credit extension under the  soft loan program . With regard to 
exchange rates, the baht against the U .S. dollar and the effective exchange rate appreciated 
in the fourth quarter,  due to  the clarity of the U .S. presidential election results and the news of 
the effic acy and distribution of COVID -19 vaccines . The Committee expressed concerns over 
the baht that could appreciate rapidly due to the  risk-on sentiment in global financial markets 
and the weak outlook of the U .S. dollar . The Committee would closely monitor de velopments 
in foreign exchange markets, in order to assess the need for additional appropriate measures, 
as well as continue to expedite  new foreign exchange ecosystem .  
The Thai financial system remained highly vulnerable amid the  slow economic recovery 
and new waves of the domestic COVID -19 cases . This led to more fragile balance sheets  
of households and businesses  due to high debt levels and consequently deteriorated  debt 
servicing  capability . In the period ahead, the  economic recovery would remain uncertain and 
uneven across business sectors,  some of which  would  be unable to return to the pre -pandemic 
level.Therefore, provision of additional capital to high -potential businesses, appropriate debt 
restructuring, and adjustments to business structures and models  would help mitigate these risks . 
3. Economic and Inflation Outlook  
Assumptions underlying the economic projection2/ are summarized as follows . First, the 
government could contain new waves of  COVID -19 infections in Thailand within a short  period  
of time  with strict measures imposed only in Samut Sakhon . Meanwhile, the number of cases 
in other areas could be brought under control by partial restrictions on some economic 
activities and without necessitating strict and extensive containment measures . As such, the 
services sector would only be partly affected while the impact on the manufacturing sector 
would not be significant . Second, COVID -19 vaccines would be widely available abroad by 
mid-2021 . Vaccination  in Thailand could  commence  in the second  half of 2021, such that  
Thailand could  re-open to  foreign tourists  without quarantine requirements, given that they 
                                                             
2/ Forecasts released on December 23, 2020 took into consideration the effects of containment measures in Samut 
Sakhon . However, the projections did not incorporate the impacts of new waves of infections that spread over 
other provinces and those of more stri ngent measures which took effect on January 4, 2021 .  
Monetary Policy Report  December 2020                                                                                                                      7 could present vaccination certificates and negative COVID -19 test results . Then, by the end 
of 2022, Thailand would re -open for commercial flights  and admit foreign tourists  without 
quarantine or vaccination requirements . Third, disbursement of government budget under the  
post-COVID economic recovery plan would be expedited effectively . 
The Thai economy was projected to contract  in 2020 by 6 .6 percent, which would be a 
smaller contraction than the previous assessment thanks to the  faster -than -expected 
recovery  in nearly all economic growth components  in the third quarter . In particular, 
merchandise exports  gradually improved  in line with trading partner economies . Moreover, 
private consumption benefited from the relaxation of domestic containment measures as well 
as government measures that shored up household purchasing power . Nevertheless, tourism 
and private investment contracted sharpl y. In 2021, the economy was projected to expand 
by 3 .2 percent , as merchandise exports would improve in tandem with trading partner 
economies ’ growth . Meanwhile, exports of services would contract more sharply and recover 
more slowly than previously assess ed, as the admission of foreign tourists to Thailand would 
likely be limited by the prolonged and severe COVID -19 situation abroad . With regard to 
domestic demand, new waves of infections would remain a main drag on private consumption . 
Meanwhile,  public e xpenditure would remain a key  economic driver . However, the government  
support  would wane somewhat due to  downward revision in the fiscal year 2021 annual budget 
and the carryover budget, following  disbursement acceleration  in 2020 . Furthermore,  some 
state -owned enterprise (SOE ) investment projects were postponed and their budgets were 
reduced . In 2022, the economy was projected to expand by 4 .8 percent , given  the recovery 
of foreign tourist figures  on the back of a widespread coverage of COVID -19 vaccination in 
Thailand and abroad . In the second half of 2022, GDP would return to the pre -pandemic level . 
The value of Thai merchandise exports would decline by 7 .4 percent in 2020 . Exports to 
China and Europe remained subdued, while  those to the U .S. and Australia grew past  the pre -
pandemic level . Merchandise exports were projected to expand by 5 .7 and 5 .0 percent in 2021 
and 2022, respectively . However, Thailand ’s exports would recover at a slower pace than 
those of its trading partners, since Thai expo rts consisted of a relatively small share of 
electronic products, which benefited the most from COVID -19, compared with  other regional 
countries .  
The tourism industry would recover at a slower pace than previously assessed . The 
prolonged COVID -19 situatio n abroad and in Thailand would result in limited admission of 
foreign tourists to Thailand and a need for strict public health measures . The number of foreign 
tourists was projected to record 6 .7 million  and 5 .5 million in 2020 and 2021, respectively . 
Neve rtheless, foreign tourist figures would grow in proportion to vaccination in Thailand and 
abroad, and would accelerate toward the latter half of 2022 when Thailand could start  
admitting tourists without vaccine screening . The Committee thus projected that the number 
of foreign tourists would surge to 23 million in 2022 .  
Private consumption would contract in 2020 by less than the previous forecast , owing 
partly to the government stimulus packages to support domestic tourism and private 
consumption, which underpinned  a swift recovery in economic activities after the lifting of 
lockdown restrictions . Another underlying factor was  the gradual recovery of the labor market 
as reflected by the decline in numbers of unemployed and underemployed workers . Neverthel ess, 
new waves of domestic COVID -19 cases, the phase -out of  government measures, and the  
Monetary Policy Report  December 2020                                                                                                                      8 fragile recovery of the labor market would weigh on private consumption  in the period ahead . 
Private consumption was projected to expand by 2 .8 and 3 .0 percent in 2021  and 2022, 
respectively .  
 Private investment would significantly  contract in 2020 , given high levels of 
excess production capacity and uncertainties surrounding economic recovery in Thailand and 
abroad . Nonetheless, private investment was projected to gro w by 4 .9 and 5 .0 percent in 2021 
and 2022, respectively, on the back of recovery in merchandise exports and private consumption , 
as well as the progress of public -private partnership (PPP) investment projects, particularly in 
the EEC .  
 The current account  balance was projected to register a surplus of 16 .2 billion 
U.S. dollars in 2020 , due to the larger -than-expected trade surplus in the third quarter  of 
2020 . Meanwhile, the surplus was projected to decrease to 11 .6 billion dollars  in 2021, mainly 
attribut able to the decline in tourism receipts . In 2022, the current account surplus was 
expected to rise to 29 .1 billion dollars thanks to the increase in tourism receipts following the 
re-opening to foreign tourists without quarantine and vaccination requiremen ts.  
 Going forward, the economic recovery would remain highly uncertain and 
could underperform the baseline projection due to the following factors . First, new 
waves of domestic COVID -19 infections could intensify and become more widespread, (Box: 
The Thai Economy and the New Wave of COVID -19) triggering another round of strict and 
extensive containment measures . Second, COVID -19 vaccines could be less effective than 
expected or vaccine distribution could take longer than expected due to certain limitat ions, 
delaying  the re -opening of the country to foreign tourists . Third, fiscal stimulus could be lower 
than estimated in the baseline projection if budget approvals for projects under the Emergency 
Decree were delayed . Fourth, balance sheets of businesses  could deteriorate and eventually 
resulting in permanent shutdowns . This could cause scarring effects whereby recovery of 
businesses would be hindered even after the pandemic subsided . Fifth, default rates of 
businesses and households could surge after the  phase -out of the credit relief measures, with 
could in turn affect the overall financial system stability .  
Headline inflation in 2020 was projected to be close to the previous assessment 
at negative 0 .9 percent, while  headline inflation in 2021 would be at 1.0 percent as 
previously forecasted . The higher oil price projection was offset by the lower fuel adjustment 
surcharge (Ft) and the high -base effect in 2020  from fresh food prices . Meanwhile, core 
inflation was projected to remain low at 0 .3 percent in  both 2020 and 2021, before edging up 
to 0.4 percent in 2022 in tandem with the gradual recovery in demand . The Committee 
assessed that headline inflation would return to the target range around mid -2021, and would 
remain close to the lower bound of the  target range throughout  the forecast period . 
   
Monetary Policy Report  December 2020                                                                                                                      9  The Thai Economy  and the New Wave of COVID -19 
The December 2020 Monetary Policy Report  released the economic projection 
approved by the Monetary Policy Committee at the meeting on December 23, 2020 . The 
projection was based on data as of December 22, 2020 when the new wave of domestic 
infections  occured only  in limited areas and the stringent containment measures were imposed 
only in Samut Sakhon  province  as well as the nearby provinces of Samut Praka rn and Samut 
Songkhram . The baseline economic projection  was based on assumptions as follows .  
(1)  Infections would occur only  in limited areas , i.e., within Samut Sakhon and the  nearby 
provinces . 
(2) No stringent and extensive containment measures would be implemented . 
Restrictions on certain economic activities in some areas could contain the new wave 
of infections  within one to two months .  
(3) The economy would be affected through different channels . For example, 
some activities in the services sector would be affected . Tourism would be severely 
affected only in high -risk areas . Meanwhile, the manufacturing sector would not be 
significantly affected and private consumption would be somewhat affected . 
Nevertheless, the acceleration of government spending  on public health could 
partly alleviate some adverse economic impacts .  
At the start of January 2021, the spread of COVID -19 turn out more severe than 
previously assessed . This increased the possibilities that the economy would underperform  
the baseline projection for 2021 and 2022 . As of January 4, 2021,  28 provinces were declared 
maximum control areas and more stringent containment measures were announced with no 
end-date specified . The impact on the economy would increase through differen t channels . 
For example, the extent to which  private consumption would be affected would depend on the 
severity of the  containment measures being implemented . The services sector and tourism 
would be affected by the low consumer confidence countrywide . Meanwhile, the impact on the 
manufacturing sector would be limited, but there could be some difficulties with logistics . 
Nonetheless, Thailand made better progress with regard to the purchase of vaccines 
than previously assessed . The government had recentl y secured a certain supply of 
vaccines,  which would allow widespread vaccination coverage to occur earlier than expected . 
In addition, the government also planned to purchase additional vaccines to cover at least 50 
percent of the total population by 2021 . 
As the new waves of COVID -19 in Thailand would be highly volatile and uncertain, 
the Committee would closely monitor developments of the situation and assess the 
economic outlook  through public health information together with monthly, weekly, and daily 
economic indicators as well as information from  the Business Liaison Program (BLP) survey in 
order to inform appropriate monetary policy decisions in the period ahead . 
 
 
  
Monetary Policy Report  December 2020                                                                                                                      10 1. The Global Economy  
Global economic activities started to recover after having severely contracted in the 
second quarter of 2020, following the relaxation of COVID -19 containment measures . 
Major advanced economies would  contract at a  slower pace in 2020 before expanding in 
2021 thanks to the vaccine efficacy and vaccination coverage,  as well as continued 
implementation of financial and fiscal measures .  
In the third quarter of 2020, major advanced economies contracted less than expected 
following the relaxation of COVID -19 containment measures . Global economic activities 
started to recover due to improvement in consumption as well as supports from government 
measures . These measures included, for example, unemployment benefits in the U .S. and 
support schemes for  short -time employment  in the euro area . Likewise, exports and 
investment  that contracted  to a lesser extent  in line with the recovery of global demand and 
gradual re -opening of the cities . 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Looking ahead, major advanced economies were expected to recover due to 
potential improvement in private consumption together with c ontinued implementation 
of financial and fiscal measures . Economies would start to recover in the first half of 2021, 
where strong recovery would be gradually observed in the second half of 2021, in line with 
development in the vaccine efficacy and COVID -19 vaccination coverage . However, factors 
that would hinder the economic recovery in the period ahead would include (1) new waves of 
the outbreak in several countries, which would prompt governments to impose more stringent 
containment measures . (2) Fragile  labor markets in both industrial and services sectors, 
particularly after government measures to support consumption gradually ended  (Chart 1 .1). 
(3) Postponement in the admission of foreign tourists under the travel bubble scheme, 
consequently affecting tourism -related businesses that had yet to sufficiently recover . The 
manufacturing sector was expected to gradually recover  (Chart 1 .2), driven by the 
improvement in  domestic demand . Nevertheless, the capacity utilization rate would remain 
below pre -pandemic levels .

in exports in line with global demand . A stronger recovery was expected in 2021 as the 
COVID -19 vaccination coverage would continue to expand .  
In 202 0, the Chinese economy was expected to continue to recover,  but at a 
slower pace than expected,  as the economic growth in the third quarter turned out  
below expectations . This was on account of a slowdown in investment and a slow recovery 
in private consum ption . However, economic indicators in November continued to 
improve  due to a gradual recovery of 
private consumption and the services 
sector  (Chart 1 .3). Looking ahead, the 
Chinese economy would continue to 
expand driven by improvement in private 
consumpt ion and the services sector . 
Meanwhile, merchandise exports would 
grow in line with the outlook of external 
demand, especially for medical equipment 
and electronics . Overall investment would 
continue to expand, while continuously 
implemented government measures would 
help support the economic expansion in 
the period ahead .  
Asian economies (excluding Japan and China ) contracted at a slower rate in the 
third quarter of 2020  following the relaxation of containment measures and gradual re - 
opening of the ci ties. Exports recovered in line with demand from trading partner economies, 
while consumption, investment, and production  gradually recovered . Asian economies were 
expected to contract at slower pace in 2020 due to gradual and continued improvement in 
merc handise exports, in tandem with external demand recovery coupled with a  series of 
financial and fiscal measures implemented . In addition, the outlook of expanding coverage 
of COVID -19 vaccination for countries in Asia in late 2021 would help support the 
economic recovery in the period ahead . However, the new waves of the outbreak in many 
countries like the Philippines, Indonesia, South Korea, and Malaysia would affect domestic 
economic recovery . Meanwhile, new waves of the outbreak in key trading partner co untries 
like the U .S. and the euro area would hinder the recovery in merchandise exports and the 
services sector in the short term .  
Governments worldwide continued to implement financial and fiscal measures to alleviate 
the economic impacts from the COVID -19 outbreak .  
Governments in many countries continued to implement additional measures  to 
alleviate the impacts  of the COVID -19 pandemic and restore the economy . Such measures 
included the period extension to provide additional financial assistance for bu sinesses and 
households affected by the COVID -19 in Japan and the euro area, the relaxation of regulations 
to facilitate foreign direct investment in Indonesia, and credit support for digital industries in 
Malaysia .

Monetary Policy Report  December 2020                                                                                                                      12 Central banks in major advanced economi es continued to maintain accommodative  
monetary policy, including both quantitative easing and low policy interest rates . The 
Federal Reserve (Fed) signaled a continued accommodative monetary policy and maintained 
the large -scale asset purchase (LSAP ) program by purchasing U .S. treasuries at least 80 
billion U .S. dollars per month  and mortgage -backed securities at least 40 billion U .S. dollars 
per month . Nevertheless, at the meeting on December 16, 2020, the Fed signaled that it would 
continue the purch ases until employment and inflation targets could be achieved, implying that 
the period of the Fed ’s quantitative easing could be prolonged . Meanwhile, the European 
Central Bank (ECB) announced the expansion of the asset purchase program, including (1) 
an additional asset purchase of 500 billion euros under the pandemic emergency purchase 
program (PEPP ), totaling to 1,850 billion euros, and the extension of the program until March 
2022 . (2) The extension of targeted longer -term refinancing operations (TLTRO s) until June 
2022, while raising credit limit for commercial banks from 50 to 55 percent of the eligible loan 
amount . (3) Maintain the pandemic emergency longer -term refinancing operations (PELTROs ) 
through 2021 in order to curb liquidity shortages . However, the ECB would also continue its 
asset purchase under the asset purchase program (APP) at 20 billion euros per month .  
Regional central banks continued to maintain an accommodative monetary 
policy . Most central banks maintained policy rates at low levels, while some central banks like 
the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) and Bank Indonesia (BI) cut policy rates further . 
Moreover, the BI continuously conducted direct financing by purchasing governme nt bonds in 
the primary market to support high fiscal deficits  during the COVID -19 pandemic .    
Thailand ’s trading partner economies were projected to contract less than expected in 
2020 . Major advanced economies would slow down to a lesser extent due to d omestic 
demand recovery, while Asian economies would register a smaller contract on account of 
external demand recovery . For 2021, trading partner economies were projected to expand 
in tandem with the economic recovery in Asia . Nonetheless, risks to the ba seline 
projection of trading partners ’ economic growth tilted to the downside . Meanwhile, vaccine 
efficacy and a fast and widespread distribution of COVID -19 vaccines would help support 
the continued economic recovery of trading partners in 2022 .  
Trading partner economies were projected to contract in 2021 less than 
previously assessed in the previous Monetary Policy Report . Major advanced and Asian 
economies were expected to slow down to a lesser extent thanks to the relaxation of 
containment measures, the recovery of Asian exports, and continued implementation of 
government measures to alleviate the economic impacts . For 2021, trading partners ’ 
economies were projected to expand on account of the economic recovery in Asia after the 
outbreak subsided . Moreover, the efficacy and a fast and widespread distribution of COVID -
19 vaccines would help foster the economic recovery of trading partner economies in 2022 . 
The Committee thus revised up the economic growth projections for Thailand ’s trading 
partners to a contraction of 3 .8 percent in 2020 before expanding by 4 .8 percent in 2021 . 
In 2022, the expansion is expected to be at 3 .1 percent . (Table 1 .1)  
Risks to the baseline projections of trading partners ’ economic growth still tilted 
to the downside, but at  a slower pace than the previous projection . This was due to the 
higher -than -expected efficacy and vaccination coverage, where vaccination coverage 
in major advanced economies was expected in the first half of 2021 . In addition, the  
Monetary Policy Report  December 2020                                                                                                                      13 positive outlook of int ernational trade policies of the new U .S. president would support 
the global trade sentiment . There could be other risks which included (1) new waves of the 
outbreak in many countries which could be more severe and prolonged than expected, and 
(2) rising vulnerabilities of global financial stability with greater possibilities of private and 
public defaults in some countries, or credit -rating downgrades . Nonetheless, the possibility 
that trading partners ’ economic growth could outperform the baseline projec tion could be from 
(1) a faster -than-expected distribution of COVID -19 vaccines, especially in emerging markets 
(EMs), and (2) larger -than-expected effects of financial and fiscal measures in many countries 
in stimulating the economy .  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Capital f lows returned to both equity and bond markets of emerging markets,  after 
concerns among investors in the global financial markets declined significantly . This was 
due to a faster -than-expected recovering outlook of the global economy, the vaccine 
efficacy and COVID -19 vaccination coverage, and the positive outlook of the U .S. 
international trade policies .  
Liquidity in the global financial system increased in line with monetary policy accommodation  
in major advanced economies . In October 2020, investors in the global financial markets 
remained cautious in investing in emerging markets and started to resume investment in the 
bond market (Chart 1 .4), particularly government bonds of emerging market countries . This 
was due to the  increase  in supply of governmen t bond issuance in response to  the increase 
in government's financing needs to fund government spending to stimulate the economy, 
where government bond yields were relatively higher than those of advanced economies . 
Subsequently in November 2020, concerns among investors in the global financial markets 
subsided, as reflected in a decline in the VIX index3/ (Chart 1 .4), owing to the faster economic 
recovery of major advanced and Asian economies than the market expected . Nevertheless, 
the economic outturns in  the third quarter of 2020 turned out better than expected on account 
of an improving outlook of merchandise exports and international tourism due to vaccine

previous quarter . Although the reduction in prices was observed in the first half of the 
quarter in response to the COVID -19 outbreak, prices increased in the latter half due to 
the v accine efficacy and vaccination coverage, as well as the announcement to reduce 
crude oil production among major oil producers to slow down rises in oil supply .  
Dubai crude oil prices in the fourth quarter of 2020 were largely unchanged from 
the previous  quarter . In the first half of the quarter, crude oil prices declined due to (1) 
new waves of the COVID -19 outbreak in Europe and the U .S., causing a slower -than-expected 
recovery in demand, and (2) a larger 
and faster -than-expected rise in oil 
supply from  Libya after domestic 
tensions subsided . However, crude 
oil prices started to rise in the 
latter half of the quarter  owing to 
(1) a higher -than-expected vaccine 
efficacy and vaccination coverage, 
resulting in better -than-expected 
outlook of oil demand in t he period 
ahead, and (2) the announcement 
on additional crude oil production 
cut by the OPEC and its allies in 
the first quarter of 2021 from 5 .8 to 
7.2 million barrels per day to offset 
lower demand pressured by the 
COVID -19 outbreak and  increased 
supply from increased oil production 
in Libya .  
The vaccine efficacy and COVID -19 vaccination coverage resulted in improvement in 
the projection of crude oil demand . The Committee thus revised up the projection of Dubai 
crude oil prices in 2021 and 2022  from 41 .5 and 45 .8 U.S. dollars per barrel to 41 .7 and 
47.3 U.S. dollars per barrel, respectively . For 2022, the projection of Dubai crude oil prices 
was 51 .5 U.S. dollars per barrel, where crude oil prices were expected to gradually rise in 
tandem with the gradual global economic recovery . However, crude oil supply would increase 
on account of the production of the OPEC and its allies after the period of an additio nal 
production cut ended . In addition, an increase in crude oil prices would incentivize shale -oil 
producers in the U .S. to resume production .  
There were risks that crude oil prices could turn out lower than the assessment . 
This would be due to the new wa ves of the COVID -19 outbreak that  worsen the demand for 
crude oil . The production and vaccination coverage could happen slowly, while vaccine 
efficacy could also be lower than expected . Moreover, trade tensions between the U .S. and 
China could re -intensify . In addition, the OPEC and its allies might fail to  comply with the 
agreement until the end of the agreed period . However, crude oil prices could  rise in response 
to geopolitical risks that could intensify more than expected, and the new U .S. president ’s 
policy to reduce fossil fuel subsidies that might increase the  costs of the U .S. oil production . 
Nevertheless, crude oil prices could rise or decline more than the assessment  under the 
current situation which remained highly uncertain

2.1 Recent Developments  
The Thai economy recovered in the second half of 2020 in light of  the relaxation of 
containment  measures and the support from government measures . However, the overall 
economic activities remained lower than the pre -pandemic level .  
In the third quarter of 2020, the Thai economy contracted by 6 .4 percent from the 
same period last year  after the sharp 12 .1-percent contraction in the previous quarter . 
The improvement was due to the relaxation of COVID19 containment measures in 
Thailand  and abroad, as well as the substantial support from government measures . 
Private consumption started to return to the pre -pandemic level on account of (1) the relaxation 
of domestic containment measures, (2) pent-up demand following lockdown, and (3) 
government stimulus measures that shored up purchasing power . Merchandise exports 
improved in line with the recovery of trading partners' economies,  especially those of electronic 
goods which benefited from the shift toward working from home, as well as th e relocation of 
production base and redirection of  electrical appliance order to Thailand . The manufacturing 
production  improved in tandem with private consumption and merchandise exports . 
Meanwhile , public spending remained an important growth driver, thr ough both current and 
capital expenditure components . Private investment saw a slight improvement but on the 
whole continued to contract sharply  given  the subdued overall demand, weak business 
confidence, and high level of excess production capacity . Expor ts of services continued to fall 
markedly  as a result of international travel restrictions .  
In the fourth quarter of 2020, latest economic indicators suggested that the 
economy  continued to recover, but the momentum would soften  relative to  the previous 
quarter . The support from government stimulus measures  remained essential in 
sustaining the economy . Meanwhile, the new wave of COVID -19 infections had limited 
impact on the overall economy this quarter as it occurred toward the end of the year . 
Private co nsumption gradually recovered, owing partly to government stimulus measures that  
supported spending for households with weak purchasing power, whereas  consumer 
confidence softened somewhat following the new wave of COVID -19 cases . Merchandise 
exports gradu ally recovered in line with trading partner economies . Government spending , 
especially public investment, remained a main  growth driver . Meanwhile, private investment 
continued to fall as business confidence remained weak . Exports of services continued to 
contract markedly as the foreign tourist figures remained substantially lower than the pre -
pandemic level,  even though Thailand had started to admit foreign tourists . As such, tourism 
would  recover more slowly than other economic sectors .  
Household income  gradually improved, but remained vulnerable . 
Overall household income gradually improved, but remained vulnerable . Farm  
income gradually improved  in the third quarter from the contraction in the second quarter 
due to the drought  (Chart 2 .1) on the back of  higher prices of rubber and oil palm . Going 
forward, agricultural output during dry season of 2021 (November 2020  – April 2021 ) would 
remain at risk due to low  water levels in major dams given  the scarce rainfall into the catchment  
Monetary Policy Report  December 2020                                                                                                                      17 area during the rainy s eason . However, the likelihood of La Nina (floods ) from the end of 2020 
to the beginning of 2021 increased . Such climate pattern could alleviate the impact of the 
drought . 
Improvement in non -farm income was  limited to  labor in the public sector  and 
certain private sectors,  such as manufacturing of air conditioners and wholesale trading . 
Meanwhile,  most households remained vulnerable from the lower income , particularly 
those in tourism -related services sector and freelance  workers . 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Headline inflation was less negative than 
the previous quarter owing mainly to 
higher  fresh food and energy prices . Core 
inflation decreased due to promotional 
activities  offered by entrepreneurs . 
Headline inflation  in the first two 
months of the fourth qu arter of 2020 
averaged at -0.46 percent, up from -0.72 
percent in the previous quarter (Chart 2 .2). 
The improvement  was attributable to  
several factors . First,  higher prices of  fresh 
food, especially fruits and vegetables, as  
some crops were damaged by floods  and 
also due to the low -base effect of vegetable 
prices in November 2019 . At the same 
time, meat prices rose on the back of stronger domestic demand as well as  increased external 
demand in light of disease outbreaks in neighboring countries . Second,  the gradual increase  
in energy prices due to  higher domestic retail oil prices in tandem with global crude oil prices .

levels . Nevertheless, uncertainties surrounding economic recovery led to a slight increase 
in new loan rates among certain business sectors . Also, corporate credit spreads remained  
elevated in  some rating groups .  
During the fourth quarter of 2020, 
overall cost o f financing remained 
accommodative , as indicated by the real 
policy interest rate that remained low 
compared to those in other emerging 
market economies (Chart 2 .6). Short -
term interest rates in financial markets  
stabilized at low levels close to the 
policy rate . Meanwhile, the 3 -month 
and 6 -month short -term government 
bond yields  fell substantially below 
policy rate  since the beginning of 
December (Chart 2 .7). This was on 
account of higher demand for short -
term bonds in order to fulfill liquidity 
mana gement needs by some domestic 
investors, as well as the  lower -than-
expected supply of short -term government 
bonds . The long -term government bond 
yields slightly decreased  in December 
(Chart 2 .8), mainly due to domestic factors . 
The demand for  long-term government 
bonds from mutual funds increased in light 
of the expectation that long -term yields 
may further decline amid the risk -on 
sentiment brought about by the clarity of 
the U .S. presidential election  results, 
which would prompt inflows into the Thai 
government bond market .

level , as reflected in the continued low reference loan rates of five largest commercial banks  
(Chart 2 .9). Also, new loan rates (NLR)4/ were low compared to the pre -pandemic average . 
However, NLR started to increase since the beginning of the third quarter  to 3.63 percent in 
October, on the back of higher rates on new loans with contract amount under 500 million baht

of household credit decelerated due to the lower income after the pandemic .    
Private sector loans5/ and bond 
issuances (private credit ) grew by 3 .8 
percent in October 2020 from the same 
period last year (Chart 2 .13). Businesses 
continued to raise funds to meet their 
liquidity needs and mitigate the impact of 
COVID -19. Additional government credit 
relief measures  helped increase SMEs ’ 
access to credit . Business loans and 
corporate bond issuances expanded 
by 3.4 percent in October 2020 from the 
same period last year (Chart  2.14). Large 
businesses, in particular,  resumed bond 
issuances in the third quarter of 2020, 
after a sharp deceleration  at the start of 
the second quarter when liquidity 
tightened  in the bond market . Meanwhile, 
business credits expanded slightly in 
October 2020, especially for  tourism -
related businesses such as those in 
services and transportation sectors, owing in part to government measures to boost domestic 
tourism . Nevertheless, credit grow th continued to slow among businesses heavily impacted 
by COVID -19, especially those in trading and manufacturing sectors  (Chart 2 .15). From the 
same period last year, household credit  expanded by  4.2 percent  continuing to decelerate 
since the second quarter in tandem with the slowdown in hire purchase and other consumer 
loans, although housing loans were supported by sales promotion offered by developers . 
Meanwhile, demand for consumer loans declined  due to the lower income after the pandemic .

continued to grow, whereas financial institutions remained cautious in extending loans . 
Corporate financing was expected to continue expanding, both through bank loans and 
bond markets . In particular, SMEs affected by COVID -19 would continue to raise more funds 
to replenish  their liquidity, as well as to restructure and make adjustments to business models  
consistent with the new economic landscape . Demand for household credits was also 
expected to increase , particularly  for hire purchase loans thanks to end -of-year promotional 
campaigns, such as launches of new car models or low -interest loans . Additionally, demand 
for credit card loans would rise in tandem with higher  spending following the relaxation of 
containment measures and the support of government measures to stimulate domestic 
consumption . However, the September 2020 survey6 / revealed that  financial institutions 
would remain cautious in extending private loans -including corporate, SMEs, and hire 
purchase loans —throughout the fourth quarter of 2020, citing risks to businesses in light of 
the highly uncertain economic outlook . Nonetheless, government support measures helped 
lessen the strictness of credit extension to priva te sectors, especially SMEs . 
The baht against the U .S. dollar and the nominal effective exchange rate (NEER ) 
appreciated in the fourth quarter due to the risk -on sentiment in the global financial 
markets, thanks to the clarity of  the U .S. presidential election results and positive 
developments regarding the efficacy and distribution of COVID -19 vaccines in major 
advanced economies .  
The baht appreciated against 
the U .S. dollar in the fourth quarter of 
2020 as compared to the third quarter 
(Chart 2 .16). At the beginning of the 
quarter,  the baht depreciated amid  
concerns over domestic political 
situation . The baht later strengthened 
due to the risk -on sentiment in the 
global financial markets brought on by 
the clarity of the U .S. presidential election 
results and positive  developments 
regarding the efficacy and distribution 
of COVID -19 vaccines in major advanced 
economies . The appreciation of the 
baht was in line with other regional 
currencies, as it was accompanied by 
capital inflows into emerging mark ets, especially countries with relative success in containing 
the spread of COVID -19, such as China, Taiwan, and Thailand . However, the baht weakened 
slightly toward the end of the fourth quarter owing to concerns over  the new wave of domestic 
COVID -19 inf ections . As of December 22, 2020, the December 2020 average of the baht was 
at 30 .07 baht to U .S. dollar, which was a 4 .3-percent appreciation from the September 2020 
average .

index was at 123 .29 as of December 22, 2020, appreciating by 1 .8 percent from the 
September 2020 average  as the baht appreciated by a larger degree than  most trading partner 
currencies (Chart 2 .17). Meanwhile, the preliminary Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER ) 
appreciated by 1 .3 percent in November 2020 from the September  2020 average . Going 
forward, the exchange rate would likely remain volatile amid risks from new waves of  COVID -
19 infections, economic policies in major advanced economies, and domestic politic al 
uncertainties . 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Financial system stability  was still subject to high risks,  particularly to financial positions 
of households and businesses,  given  the slow economic recovery and the new wave of 
COVID -19 infections . Government measures going forward must be continuous,  targeted, 
and timely in order to ensure a smooth economic recovery .  
Financial system stability was still subject to high risks given the slow economic 
recovery and the new wave of COVID -19 infections . Nevertheless, the stabilit y of financial 
institutions remained robust, as reflected by adequately high levels of commercial banks ’ 
capital buffers and reserves, which provide cushion against risks of deteriorating credit quality . 
The Bank of Thailand had placed an emphasis on pre -emptive measures to ensure that 
commercial banks maintain an adequate level of capital buffers and reserves to withstand 
future uncertainties, preserve lending capacity, and provide continuous support for economic 
activities . Risks to financial system stab ility that warranted close monitoring can be 
summarized as follows . 
1. Household financial positions were fragile given the elevated debt level and 
the deterioration in debt servicing capability as employment and income were affected 
by COVID -19. The house hold debt to GDP ratio rose to 86 .6 percent in the third quarter of 
2020, up from 83 .8 percent in the previous quarter due mainly to economic contraction .  
Regarding household debt servicing capability, the NPL ratio of consumer loans 
stabilized at around 3 percent in the third quarter of 2020, thanks in part to the credit relief 
measures for retail borrowers, such as interest rate reduction, loan moratorium, reduction in

Monetary Policy Report  December 2020                                                                                                                      24 loan repayments, and debt restructuring . In the period ahead, consumer loan quality wo uld 
need to be monitored closely after the phase -out of relief measures . Moreover, as the 
economic recovery remains  slow and uneven across business sectors next year, 
income and debt servicing capability of certain groups of households would continue 
to be  fragile . These include freelance workers  with uncertain income streams and labor in 
tourism that would recover more slowly than other economic sectors . Therefore, future 
government measures should be in the form of targeted and comprehensive support 
packa ges, such as income assistance through domestic tourism stimulus measures coupled 
with a debt restructuring program, as well as a campaign to promote financial discipline . This 
would ensure effective outcome both in the short and long terms .   
2. Business financial positions improved somewhat, but  vulnerabilities 
remained from the risks of defaults given the highly uncertain economic recovery . 
Business revenue and profits improved slightly  in the third quarter as compared to the previous 
quarter, thanks to the resumption of  economic activities after the relaxation of containment 
measures . As a result, operating profit margins (OPM ) improved overall, especially for 
restaurant, real -estate, and construction businesses . Nevertheless, the hotel business 
continued to make losses despite some improvements from the previous quarter . Similarly, 
the airline industry saw a persistent decline in OPM . Interest coverage ratio (ICR) of 
businesses overall largely increased from the previous quarter, but remained bel ow the 5 -year 
average, especially for businesses in tourism -related services such as the hotel and airline 
businesses,  which  were severely  affected  by the pandemic  would not be able to recover , as 
international travel restrictions had led to a sharp declin e in demand from foreign tourists . 
Meanwhile, demand from local tourists was not sufficient to offset the loss, despite continued 
government measures to stimulate domestic tourism . Hence, debt servicing capability of these 
businesses would need to be monit ored closely .  
In the period ahead, the Thai economy would be subject to large degree of 
uncertainties from the new wave of COVID -19 cases  and the uneven recovery across 
business sectors . Furthermore, some sectors may be unable to  recover to the pre -
pandem ic level . Thus, businesses must restructure and make adjustments to business 
models consistent with the post -COVID environment . Many sectors faced structural 
problems, such as low competitiveness in the steel and fabricated metal sectors, obsolete 
manufacturing technology in the hard disk drive (HDD ) sector due to replacement of  HDD with  
solid state drive (SSD), or excess supply in  the real estate sector . Moreover, the pandemic 
resulted in excess capacity in the services sector, especially tourism -related businesses . In 
addition, firms with liquidity shortages, especially SMEs, often lacked access to credit . Going 
forward,  governmen t relief measures  must therefore be continuous, targeted, and timely . 
High-potential firms should receive the liquidity needed to support their businesses, as well as 
appropriate debt restructuring consistent with debt servicing capability . Such government  
support, along with adjustments on the firms ’ part, would be crucial for business survival in the future . 
3. The real estate market remained fragile on account of the continued decline 
of domestic and foreign demands  given the slowdown and uncertainties in the Thai and 
global economies, as well as international travel restrictions . The Real Estate Information 
Center (REIC ) projected that the value of housing transfers in Bangkok and vicinities in the 
second half of 2020 would contract by 42 .5 percent from  the same period last year . Also, 
foreign demand continued to fall, as suggested by the value of funds transferred for  Thai  
Monetary Policy Report  December 2020                                                                                                                      25 condominium purchases  by non -residents that  dropped by more than 10 percent in the second 
half of 2020 (July – October ) from the sam e period last year (Chart 2 .18) in light of the 
economic slowdown and international travel restrictions . Nevertheless, the real estate market 
conditions improved in the third quarter . The value and number of housing transfers  increased 
from the second quar ter thanks to sales promotion offered by developers . In the period ahead, 
there remained a need to monitor adjustments made by developers to address excess supply . 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.2 Outlook for the Thai Economy  
The Thai economy contracted in 2020 less than previously assessed . However, the 
economic recovery in 2021 would be slower than expected on account of the new wave 
of COVID -19 infections and the weak tourism sector . Economic growth would pick up in 
2022 in line with the assumption on foreign tourist fi gures . Meanwhile, headline inflation 
projection remained mostly  unchanged .  
The key assumptions underlying economic projections in this report are 
summarized as follows . First, the government could contain new waves of domestic COVID -19 
infections within a short period of time, with strict containment measures imposed only in 
Samut Sakhon . Meanwhile, infections in other areas of the country could be brought under 
control by restrictions on certain economic activities without necessitatin g strict and extensive 
containment measures . As such, the service sector would only be partially affected, and the 
impact on the manufacturing sector would not be significant . Second, there would be a

Monetary Policy Report  December 2020                                                                                                                      26 widespread coverage of COVID -19 vaccination 
abroad by m id-2021, such that Thailand could  
re-open to foreign tourists without quarantine 
requirements, providing  they could present 
vaccination certificates and negative COVID -19 
test results . Also, vaccination in Thailand could 
commence in the second half of 2021  and 
Thailand w ould re -open for commercial flights 
and admit foreign tourists without quarantine or 
vaccinatio n requirements in the second half of 
2022 . This timeline was more delayed than the 
assumption in the previous Monetary Policy 
Report , which assum ed normal admission of 
foreign tourists from the second half of 2021 . 
Third, disbursement of government budget 
under the post -COVID economic recovery plan 
of the Emergency Decree Authorizing the Ministry of Finance to Raise Loans to Solve 
Problems, to Reme dy and Restore the Economy and Society as Affected by the Coronavirus 
Disease Pandemic would be expedited effectively . 
At the meeting on December 23, 2020, the Monetary Policy Committee projected 
that the Thai economy would contract by 6 .6 percent in 2020,  which was less than the 
7.8 percent contraction projected in the previous Monetary Policy Report . The 
improvement was thanks to faster -than-expected recovery in nearly all growth components  
in the third quarter . In particular, merchandise exports graduall y improved in line with trading 
partner economies . Moreover, the relaxation of domestic containment measures allowed for 
a resumption of some economic activities, leading to a gradual recovery in labor income . In 
addition, continued government  stimulus mea sures resulted in faster -than-expected recovery 
in domestic spending . However, in the coming period, economic momentum would 
soften somewhat on account of the new wave of COVID -19 infections in the country . In 
particular, containment measures weighed on do mestic spending, while the actual 
implementation of protocols to admit foreign tourists saw fewer visitors than previously 
assessed . As such, Thailand ’s economic recovery in the period ahead would be slower than 
expected, despite some short -term improvemen t (Chart 2 .19). Thus, the economy was 
projected to expand by 3 .2 percent in 2021, down from the previous forecast of 3 .6 percent .  
The Thai economy was expected to grow at a faster pace of 4 .8 percent in 2022 , 
given the recovery of foreign tourist figures on the back of widespread COVID -19 vaccination 
in Thailand and abroad . The Thai economy would return to the pre -pandemic level in the second 
half of 2022 . 
Headline inflation was projected at a negative 0 .9 percent in 2020, and 1 .0 percent  
in 2021, relatively unchanged from the previous assessment . Meanwhile, headline 
inflation also projected to be at 1 .0 percent in 2022, in line with the upward revision of the oil 
price assumption . The Committee assessed that headline inflation would return to the t arget 
range around mid -2021, and would remain close to the lower bound of the target range 
throughout the forecast period .

Summary of key forecast assumptions  
  Trading partner economies  were projected to expand faster than in the previous forecast, 
given the faster -than-expected recovery of economic activities in many countries in the third 
quarter of 2020 . The global economy would continue to recover gradually in  the period 
ahead . The new waves of COVID -19 outbreaks  in many countries would not have severe 
impacts on the economy as the new round of containment measures were less stringent  
and more contained compared to the first one .  
 The Federal Funds Rate was projected to be maintain ed at a range of 0 .00 – 0.25 percent 
throughout the forecast horizon, as with the previous forecast . 
 Regional currencies (excluding the Chinese yuan ) would appreciate more than previously 
assessed throughout the forecast horizon, on account of the steady  recovery of Asian 
economies, which had seen relative success in containing the spread of the virus compared 
to major advanced economies . In addition, investors ’ positive outlook toward  the progress 
of COVID -19 vaccine development would result in an increa se in capital inflows into risky 
assets of EM countries .  
 The Dubai crude oil price  would increase throughout the forecast horizon on account of 
stronger demand, following global economic recovery and high efficacy of the COVID -19 
vaccines . Nevertheless,  there remained a risk that the crude oil price could decline if its 
earlier increase is large enough to prompt an increase in supply of shale oil by producers 
in the United States . 
 Farm income (excluding government support measures ) improved in 2020, re cording a 
slight growth instead of a contraction earlier projected on the back of a significant increase 
in agricultural prices during periods of output shortage, especially for pork, oil palm, and 
rubber . Meanwhile, farm income growth was projected to slo w in 2021 due to (1) the high -
base effect from 2020, (2) low water levels in major dams that would impact off -season rice 
production, and (3) the intensified COVID -19 situation in neighboring countries that would 
prevent migrant workers from returning to r ubber plantations . The labor shortage would 
improve in 202 2.

  Public spending at current price was revised down due to  (1) the smaller -than-expected 
and delayed disbursement of government budget under the COVID -19 emergency decree, 
(2) the shift in budget allocation under the emergency decree toward more transfers, (3) 
the downward revision in the fiscal year 2021 annual budget and the carryover budget, 
following disbursement acceleration in 2020, and (4) the postponement of investment 
projects and reduction in budgets of some state -owned enterprises (SOEs ) as some 
projects were not operationally ready . For 2022, public spending was projected to slow 
down, in part because the emergency decree budget would have largely been exhausted .  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Merchandise exports would contract sharply, but would begin to pick up in the period 
ahead in tandem with recovery in trading partner economies .  
The value of Thai merchandise exports would decline by 7 .4 percent in 2020 ,  
a smaller contraction compared to the previous Monetary Policy Report  thanks to 
better -than -expected exports volume outturn in the third quarter of 2020 . Going forward, 
merchandise exports would improve on account of the expansion of tra ding partner economies . 
However, Thailand ’s exports would recover at a slower pace than those of its trading partners, 
since Thai exports consisted of a relatively small share of electronic products, which benefited 
from COVID -19, compared with other regional countries . Thus, merchandise exports were 
projected to expand by 5 .7 and 5 .0 percent in 2021  and 2022, respectively .

of foreign tourists to Thailand . 
The tour ism industry would recover at a slower pace than previously assessed, 
despite improvements in trading partner economies and progress in COVID -19 vaccine 
development . Since the COVID -19 situation abroad would likely be prolonged and severe, 
Thailand could a dmit fewer foreign tourists than expected . Looking ahead, widespread 
vaccination abroad was expected by mid -2021, but by that time the vaccination coverage 
among Thai population would still be relatively low . Thus, the country ’s capacity to admit 
foreign tourists would remain constrained . Only in the third quarter of 2021 would Thailand be 
able to re -open to foreign tourists who have been vaccinated without quarantine requirements, 
given that they could present vaccination certificates and pass the health screening upon 
arrival (Chart 2 .21). The Committee projected 5 .5 million foreign tourists in 2021, lower 
than the assessment in the previous Monetary Policy Report . Nevertheless, foreign tourist 
figures would grow in proportion to vaccination coverage in T hailand and abroad, and would 
accelerate toward the latter half of 2022 when Thailand could re -open for commercial flights 
and admit foreign tourists without quarantine or vaccination requirements . The Committee 
thus projected that the number of foreign to urists  would surge to 23 million in 2022 . 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The current account balance was projected to register a surplus of 16 .2 billion 
U.S. dollars in 2020,  which was higher than the previous assessment due to the larger -than-
expected trade surplus in the third quarter of 2020 . Meanwhile, the surplus was projected 
to decrease to 11 .6 billion dollars in 2021, mainly attributable to the decline in tourism 
receipts and the increase in reinvested earnings payments in line with the higher profits of 
foreign firms in T hailand . In 2022, the current account surplus was expected to rise to 
29.1 billion dollars  thanks to the increase in tourism receipts following the re -opening to 
foreign tourists without quarantine and vaccination requirements .

Monetary Policy Report  December 2020                                                                                                                      30 Private consumption declined  less than assessed, but downside risks and high uncertainties  
remained in the period ahead .  
Private consumption would contract in 2020 by less than the previous forecast  
from the significantly higher -than-expected outturn  in the third quarter , owing partly to  
government stimulus packages to support domestic tourism and private consumption, which 
underpinned a swift recovery in economic activities after the lifting of lockdown restrictions . 
Another underlying factor was the gradual recovery of the labo r market as reflected by the 
decline in numbers of unemployed and underemployed workers7 /. The number of 
underemployed workers stood at 2 .2 million in November 2020, down from the second 
quarter ’s peak of 5 .4 million . Nevertheless, private consumption slow ed somewhat toward the 
end of the year as the new wave of domestic COVID -19 cases dampened consumer confidence . 
Private consumption  was projected to expand by 2 .8 and 3 .0 percent in 2021 and 2022, 
respectively . However, downside risks and high uncertainties that remained . New 
waves  of infections  in the country, the phase -out of government stimulus packages and credit 
relief measures, the lack of clarity regarding government spending projects, domestic political 
uncertainties, vulnerable  househol d financial positions due to elevated household debt, and 
the fragile recovery  in the labor market  could weigh on the recovery of private consumption in 
the period ahead . 
Private investment declined markedly but would gradually recover .  
Private investment  would contract in 2020 by less than the previous projection,  
thanks to higher -than-expected outturn in the third quarter consistent with smaller -than-
expected contractions in domestic and external demand . In the period ahead, private 
investment would gradually recover , expanding by 4 .9 and 5 .0 percent in 2021 and 2022, 
respectively  on the back of  the recovery in merchandise exports and private consumption, as 
well as the progress of public -private partnership (PPP) investment projects, particularly in the 
EEC, which would improve the country ’s investment climate .  
Headline inflation would be close to the previous assessment . Headline inflation would 
return to the target range around mid -2021, and remain close to the lower bound of the 
target range throu ghout the forecast period . 
Headline inflation in 2020 was projected at negative 0 .9 percent, close to the 
previous assessment,  in line with the higher oil and fresh food prices in the second half of 
the year . For 2021, headline inflation would be at 1 .0 percent as previously forecasted . 
The higher oil price projection was offset by the lower fuel adjustment surcharge (Ft) and the 
high-base effect in 2020 from fresh food prices . Meanwhile, core inflation was projected to 
remain low at 0 .3 percent in both 2 020 and 2021, as recovery in demand remained in an early 
stage . The Committee  assessed that headline inflation would return to the target range 
around mid -2021, and would remain close to the lower bound of the target range 
throughout the forecast period .

and fewer than 24 hours per week in non -agricultural sectors  .  
Monetary Policy Report  December 2020                                                                                                                      31 Economic and inflation projections would be subject to high uncertainties and downside risks,  
particularly from developments of the new wave of COVID -19 infections in the country, 
vaccine efficacy and vaccination coverage, and the timing of the admission o f foreign tourists .  
Going forward, the Thai economy would remain highly uncertain and could face 
downside risks , as reflected in a wide fan chart that tilted toward the downside  (Chart 2 .22). 
Despite some uncertainties being cleared up in the previous per iod, such as clear signs of 
economic recovery in the third quarter and satisfactory progress in the COVID -19 vaccine 
development and distribution, the new wave of domestic COVID -19 infections remained a 
major risk factor to economic growth . This projection incorporated some its impacts into the 
base case, such as the downward revision of foreign tourist figures in 2021 . Nevertheless, 
the Thai economy could underperform the baseline projection due to the following 
factors . First, the new wave of domestic COVID -19 infections could intensify and become 
more widespread, triggering another round of strict and extensive containment measures with 
larger economic impact than anticipated . Second, COVID -19 vaccines could be less effective 
than expected or vaccine distribution could take longer than expected due to certain 
limitations, such as vaccine availability or the public ’s concerns about its safety . These could 
delay the re -opening of the country to foreign tourists . Third, fiscal stimulus could be  lower 
than estimated in the baseline projection in case of delays in budget approvals for projects 
under the Emergency Decree, which was set to expire in the third quarter of 2021 . Fourth, 
balance sheets of businesses could deteriorate and eventually resu lting in permanent 
shutdowns . This could cause scarring effects whereby recovery of businesses would be 
hindered even after the pandemic subsided . Fifth, default rates of businesses and households 
could surge after the phase -out of the credit relief measur es, which could in turn affect the 
overall financial system stability . 
Nevertheless, the Thai economy could still outperform baseline projection in the 
following scenarios . First, herd immunity could be achieved earlier than assessed through 
effective vac cine distribution . Thus, the outbreak abroad would peter out sooner than 
expected, allowing Thailand to re -open for foreign tourists at an earlier date . Second, the 
government could introduce additional economic stimulus packages to support domestic 
consum ption and investment, and credit relief measures could be more effective than 
expected . Third, domestic demand could expand faster than projected owing to the crowding -
in effects from government infrastructure investment and PPP projects . And fourth, the c ountry 
could benefit more than expected from the relocation of manufacturing bases and shifts in 
sales orders of multinational companies to Thailand . As for inflation projections, headline 
and core inflation could underperform baseline projection due to do wnside risks to crude 
oil prices and economic growth outlook .

The MPC  maintained  the policy rate at 0 .50 percent  and assessed that the economy still 
needed support from the continued low policy rate . Therefore, the limited policy space 
should be preserved for the appropriate and most effe ctive timing, particularly  amid high 
uncertainties surrounding the economy .  
At the meetings on November 18 and December 23, 20208/, the Committee voted 
unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 0 .50 percen t. The Committee projected that the 
Thai economy would see a smaller contraction in 2020 than previously assessed and continue 
to recover in 2021 and 2022 . However, there could be adverse risks to the baseline 
projection . In parti cular, uncertainty surrounding the COVID -19 situation in the near term, as 
well as the vaccine efficacy and vaccination coverage which could be limited, can affect  the 
progress in the admission of foreign tourists in the period ahead . In addition, uneven 
recoveries across economic sectors and areas would affect the sustainability of economic 
growth going forward . The Thai financial system remained stable, but households and SMEs 
were  still vulnerable . Headline inflation would return to the target range around mid -2021  and 
would remain close to the lower bound of the target range throughout the forecast 
period . Meanwhile, medium -term inflation expectations  remained anchored within the target 
range . The Committee  therefore assessed that the economy still n eeded support from the 
continued low policy rate, and the limited policy space should be preserved for the appropriate 
and most effective timing .  
In determining the appropriate course of monetary policy, details on the key 
assessmen t are as follows .  
Goin g forward, the economic recovery would remain highly uncertain, particularly due to 
the impacts of the new wave of  domestic  COVID -19 infections  and the continuity of government 
measures . Policy coordination among  government agencies would therefore be critical in 
supporting economic recovery .  
The Thai economy continued to recover, but would face high uncertainties from 
the impacts of prolonged COVID -19 situation abroad and  new waves of domestic 
COVID -19 infections that could become more widespread . Moreover,  households and 
SMEs would become vulnerable after the phase -out of government measures . Given such 
uncertainties, the government should therefore closely monitor the economic recovery, and 
accelerate the financial and fiscal measures previously introduced  in order to have a broader  
and sustained impact on the economy . Moreover, the government should prepare additional 
measures in order to respond to unexpected events . Going forward, the continuity of 
government measures and policy coordination am ong government agencies would be 
critical  in supporting economic recovery  (Box: The Thai economic headwinds and tailwinds ,

Monetary Policy Report  December 2020                                                                                                                      34 Uneven  recoveries resulted in limited access to credit for some businesses . Thus, 
financial institutions should  expedite debt restructuring and credit extension under various 
measures, for example, the credit guarantee  schemes .  
The economic recovery  remained  uneven across  business sectors  and areas, 
resulting  in tighter  access to credit for some  businesses due to higher credit risks . The 
Committee, therefore , encouraged  financial institutions  to expedite debt restructuring  for 
both retail and corporate borrowers in order to have a broader impact . Moreover, credit 
extension under various programs  such as credit guarantee schemes should be accelerated 
in order to address liquidity problems in a targeted and timely manner  (Box: Liquidity in the Thai 
Financial System : sufficient amount but insufficient distribution ). Although such financial measures 
would incur fiscal costs in the short term, they should help sustain employment  and increase 
liquidity for SMEs, as well as reduce scarring effects and long -term costs to  the economy .  
Rapid appreciation of  the baht  weighed on the  fragile economic recovery . Thus , the 
Committee  would  closely monitor  such  development  in order to assess the need for 
additional  appropriate measures, as well as continue to expedite new foreign exchange 
ecosystem .  
The Committee expressed concerns over  the rapid appreciation of the baht  that 
affected the  fragile economic recovery . Thus, the Committee  would  closely monitor developments  
in foreign exchange markets  and capital flows, as well as  assess the need for additiona l appropriate 
measures to pre vent exchange rate appreciation from hindering economic recovery . This was 
to lessen  short -term pressure on the baht and address structural problems in the Thai foreign 
exchange markets by continuing to expedite new foreign exchange ecosystem . This should 
help balance the capital flows, facilitate outward investment of domestic investors, make 
foreign exchange hedging more flexible for businesses, and encourage competitions among 
service providers  (Box: The BOT and the  development of the new foreign  exchange  ecosystem ).  
Fiscal measures continued  to play a crucial role in  sustaining the  economy amid high 
uncertainties surrounding the economic recovery .  
The Committee considered fiscal measures to be very crucial in sustaining the 
economy during the pe riod of high uncertainties . Meanwhile, rising public debt in the 
medium term would not pose a significant fiscal risk, due to the following reasons . (This 
was due to (1) the low level of pre -pandemic public debt, (2) the long maturity of debt as 
reflected in the remaining average time to maturity of approximately 10 years, (3) debt mostly 
denominated in local currency, and (4) nominal GDP growth expected to be higher than 
interest rates at which the government pays its  debt. Moreover, Thailand was rated BBB + with 
a stable outlook . The Committee viewed that if public debt accumulation was intended to 
support the economic recovery and finance key infrastructure projects, this would help sustain 
economic growth and public debt to GDP . When the economy gets back on track, the 
government should strengthen fiscal capacity through revenue and expenditure reforms to 
promote long -term fiscal sustainability .

management stimulus measures  to boost econ omic recovery in the short term  and to  
ensure  full-potential, inclusive, and  sustainable growth in the long term .   
The Committee expressed concerns over a continued decline in Thailand ’s 
economic growth . In particular, the COVID -19 pandemic would cause some scarring 
effects on Thailand ’s economic growth potential in the long  term,  even after the  
 pandemic subsided . This therefore warranted the need to expedite structural 
reforms  alongside  demand -management stimulus measures  to boost economic recovery 
in the short term  in order to achieve all three economic objectives, namely  (1) growth, (2) income 
distribution , and (3) sustainability  and resiliency . Such supply -side structural reforms would 
require refor ms of key economic institutions, namely households,  businesses, and the 
government . For example , reforming  the labor market,  uplifting infrastructure for digital economy , 
and reducing regulations that hindered coordination  among government  agencies  (Box: Moving 
towards the Thai economic goals through accelerating structural reforms ).  
The Committee continued to put  emphasis on supporting economic recovery, and  stand 
ready to use additional  appropriate monetary policy tools if necessary .  
Under the moneta ry policy framework with object ives of maintaining price stability, 
supporting sustainable and  full-potential economic growth, and  preserving financial 
stability, the Committee continued to put  emphasis on  supporting economic  recovery  as 
well as  monitor the adequacy of fiscal measures and the fragility in the labor markets . Going 
forward, the Committee would closely monitor key risk factors, such as domestic political 
uncertainty,  the progress  in the admis sion of foreign tourists, and financial po sitions of 
businesses  and households, and would  stand ready to use additional  appropriate monetary 
policy tools if necessary .  
The monetary policy target for the medium -term horizon and for the year  2021 was set to 
be the headline inflation within the rang e of 1 -3 percent .  
On December 22, 2020,  the Cabinet approved the monetary policy target, which 
was mutually agreed between the MPC and the Minister of Finance to set the headline 
inflation within  the range of 1 –3 percent as the target for the medium -term horizon and 
for the year 2021 . This range target  was deemed appropriate in addressing the changing 
inflation dynamics from technological advancements and the transition into an aging society, 
as well as  being conducive to the  full-potential economic growth . Moreover, the  range inflation 
target enhanced  the flexibility in monetary policy formulation amid highly volatile and uncertain 
global economic circumstances after the COVID -19 outbreak, while allowing the MPC to fulfill 
economic growth and financial sta bility objectives more effectively .

what else must be prepared?  
The Thai economy continued to recover but would still face high uncertainties 
especially regarding the new wave s of COVID -19 infection s in Thailand . Looking ahead,  
tailwinds supporting the economic recovery would include fiscal policy and coverage of 
COVID -19 vaccination in Thailand and abroad , which would be essential to the recovery of 
economic activities, particularly tourism . On the other hand, key headwinds hindering the 
economic recovery would come from a prolonged COVID -19 outbreak abroad  and new wave 
of infections  in Thailand , as well as fragilit ies of businesses and SMEs as public assistance 
measures gradually ended . Uncertainties of aforementioned factors prompted the public 
sector to monitor developments on the economic recovery closely, expedite financial 
and fiscal measures previously implemented to have a broader impact, and prepare 
additional mea sures in case of unexpected situations .  
Chart 1  Headwinds  and key risks to the Thai economy in the period ahead would come from the 
 impacts from the new wave of domestic infections .

Risks  - Intensifying COVID -19 
situation  in the old or new 
areas, triggering more 
stringent containment 
measures  
- The new wave of the 
infection would  caus e 
financial institutions to be 
more cautious in extending 
loans, resulting in less 
liquidity distribution to 
businesses than expected  - Uncertainties surrounding 
vaccine efficacy and 
vaccination coverag e 
including carrier 
prevention,  side effects, 
limitation s on public health 
service unit, and 
vaccination consents 
among Thai people  - Potential changes in 
tourism businesses after 
the outbreak subsided, 
resulting a smaller return 
of foreign tourists  
 
During the first half of 2021, key tailwinds would be from fiscal measures amid uncertainties 
the new wave of domestic infections . 
During the first half of 2021, key tailwinds to the economy would come from (1) 
fiscal measures which focused on fostering the continued recovery of domestic demand, 
especially additional spending under the economic and social recovery plan under the 
Emergency Decree following the phasing out of government measures to support 
consumption including “shop and payback ” campaign, co -payment scheme, and “we travel 
together ” campaign, and (2) potential easing of trade protectionism due to policies of the 
new US president, potentially benefiting Thai merchandise exports and shoring up the 
economy during when  admitting large number of foreign tourists was still unable . On the other 
hand, key headwinds to the recovery included (1) the new wave of domestic COVID -19 
outbreak which triggered more stringent containment measures, despite varying degree 
among areas, directly affecting consumer confidence and spending, and (2) the phase -out 
of case -by-case debt payment holiday . Should cooperation on debt restructuring among 
financial institutions and borrowers happen slower than expected, this could affect financial 
positions of businesses . BOT thus continued to expedite debt restructuring by establishing 
Debt Restructuring Supervisory Committee, including representatives from both public and 
private sectors, to support an efficient debt restructuring consistent with the situation . 
Nonetheless, risks that could arise during the first half of 2021 included (1) a more 
severe COVID -19 outbreak situation both domestically and internationally  in the old or 
same areas, triggering a more stringent containment measures, which could result in (2) 
cautious credit extension of financial institutions as a result higher credit risks of some 
businesses . Thus, credit guarantee scheme could be less effective and liquidity distribution to 
businesses could be less than expected .  
Durin g the second half of 2021, key tailwinds would come from the recovery of foreign tourist  
figures amid uncertainties surrounding vaccine efficacy and COVID -19 vaccination coverage . 
During the second half of 2021, key tailwinds included (1) COVID -19 vaccination 
coverage both domestically and internationally, leading to the recovery of tourism once 
again . During that period, Thailand would gradually admit more and more foreign tourists 
under the assumption that foreign tourists would not be subject to quarantine requirements if  
Monetary Policy Report  December 2020                                                                                                                      38  they were to be vaccinated . (2) Greater clarity of infrastructure investments under the 
Public -Private Partnership (PPP) projects, particularly in the EEC area since the second 
half of 2021 and through 2022,  would foster an investment -friendly environment in Thailand . 
On the contrary, key headwinds included deadline of financial measures previously 
implemented approaching in 2021 . These included measures to assist borrowers, relaxation 
of regulations regardin g classification of non -performing loan borrowers, liquidity coverage 
ratio (LCR), and net stable funding ratio (NSFR ), as well as FIDF9/ fee cut . BOT and related 
agencies would closely monitor the situations and would stand ready to implement 
additional ap propriate measures if necessary, where risks in this period would come 
from the less -than -assessed efficacy of COVID -19 vaccines or vaccination coverage .  
In 2022, key tailwind s would include the re -opening of the country for commercial flights 
despite fiscal impulse started to slow down . Meanwhile, key risks would come from the 
progress in Thailand ’s economic restructuring to be consistent with the post -COVID 
environment .    
Economic activities were expected to return to the pre -pandemic level in the 
second half of 2022 mainly in line with the recovery of tourism . Key tailwind s would 
come from the re -opening of the country for commercial flights admitting foreign 
tourists with no quarantine or vaccination requirements when Thai and foreign citizens 
would  achieve herd immunity following widespread vaccination coverage . On the contrary, 
key headwind s during the same period would come from (1) decreasing role of 
government regarding the economic and social restoration as expenditure under the 
Emergency Decre e would be gradually subside, and (2) the deadline of BOT ’s soft loan 
program approaching in two years . However, borrowers under soft loan program could 
contact financial institutions for debt restructuring and duration extension to over two years . 
Nonethe less, risk after having successfully contained the outbreak would be due to 
potentially changing behavior of tourists around the world , such as, avoiding crowded 
tourist locations and placing importance to public health safety . Thus, this could take a long  
time until the number of tourists would return to the pre -pandemic level .  
The Thai economic recovery would remain highly uncertain, the continuity of government 
measures and policy coordination among government agencies would thus be critical .  
In the next two years, the Thai economic recovery would face high uncertainties  
both from headwinds and various risks at different times . Therefore, the continuity of 
government measures and policy coordination among government agencies would be 
critical to the e conomic recovery . Apart from the monetary policy  that must remain 
accommodative, BOT and related agencies should closely monitor the situations in order to 
review if financial and credit measures  that would gradually end were still needed to support 
the ec onomic recovery in order to mitigate risks to financial stability in the period ahead as 
well as expedite additional measures to ensure widespread and targeted liquidity distribution, 
including credit guarantee scheme to reduce credit risks . Fiscal measure s would still play an 
important role in continually sustaining the economic recovery, particularly in 2021 where 
recovery of tourism had yet to sufficiently recover and remained highly uncertain . Government 
should thus accelerate disbursement under the  economic and social restoration plan within

with the implementation of supply -side policies  to support changing business structures and 
labor upskilling . Moreover, th e COVID -19 outbreak was the root cause of both headwinds and 
risks. Therefore, proactive spending to upgrade public health capacity including testing, 
monitoring, and screening, together with sufficient investment in COVID -19 vaccines, 
would be most worthw hile and essential to support the Thai economic recovery . Such 
investment would reduce the likelihood and severity of recurring outbreaks and allow 
for a faster re -opening of the country .

 Liquidity in the Thai Financial System :  
sufficient amount but insufficient distribution  
Expediting liquidity distribution to businesses and households affected by the COVID -19 
outbreak was among  the key issues that  the Monetary Policy Committee  (MPC ) expressed 
concerns and  discussed extensively in the previous meetings . Liquidity in the Thai financial 
system remained ample, lending rates and government bond yields were at a historical low,  
and overall business credits continued to gr ow. However, financing and credit extension were 
still concentrated in  certain business , especially large businesses, while liquidity was not 
distributed sufficiently to some other businesses highly affected by the COVID -19 and SMEs . 
Thus, the key challenge is to find a mechanism that would help ensure a more widespread 
and targeted liquidity distribution  rather  than increasing the liquidity in the financial system overal l. 
Liquidity in the Thai financial system remained ample and increased during the outbreak .  
Overall liquidity , that remained ample , was reflected by the growth in  deposits10/ 
and bill of exchange (B/E) that averaged at 9 .8 percent following the COVID -19 outbreak , 
compared to a pre -pandemic average of 4 .2 percent  (Chart 1 ). Deposits at commercial banks 
rose when the economy exhibited uncertainty, resulting in lower loan to deposits & B /E ratio 
(L/D ratio ) at 91 .5 percent, down from the pre -pandemic ratio at 96 .3 percent (Chart 1 ). This 
reflected that although deposits expanded, loans11 / did not grow as much, partly due to 
concerns of commercial banks over heightened credit risks of borrowers in some businesses 
caused  by the COVID -19 outbreak .

 In addition, increased liquidity was reflected by the high level of liquid assets of 
commercial banks , where high -quality liquid asset (HQLA ) of banks recorded 4 .48 trillion 
baht in October 2020, up around 20 percent from end of 2019 . This led to higher liquidity 
coverage ratio (LCR) at 190 percent, the highest since the LCR regulation became effective 
in 2016 .  
Ample liquidity was also reflected by historical low financing costs .  
Costs of borrowing through commercial banks and the bond market declined to 
historical low levels, partly due to 3 policy rate cuts since early 202 0, from 1 .25 to 0 .50 
percent . This resulted in low interest rates in the money market, low lending rates of 
commercial banks, and low government bond yields wh ich became lower than  the historical 
average (Chart 2 ). For instance, minimum loan rate (MRR ), new loan rate (NLR), and 5 -year 
government bond yield were now at 6 .11, 3 .63, and 0 .66 percent, respectively .  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Business financing could still expand overall, but liquidity had yet to be sufficiently distributed .  
Overall b usiness financing continues expanding  in the previous periods, 
through credit, bond, and equity markets . However, financing and loan extension were 
still concentrated  in certain  businesses, especially large businesses . This could be seen 
from growth of commercial bank ’s loans for large businesses with credit limit over 500 million 
baht at over 10 percent in the first half of 2020, which continued to expand in the third quarter . 
This was as businesses accelerated borrowings to build liquidity buffer durin g the outbreak, 
and partly as some businesses switched funding sources to credit market instead of issuing 
corporate bonds when financial market conditions were highly volatile . Meanwhile, commercial 
bank ’s loans extended to SMEs with credit limit fewer th an 500 million baht continued to 
contract from the previous year, despite supports from the soft loan program . (Chart 3 ). This 
reflected that although costs of financing remained low, it did not provide much incentive for 
financial institutions to extend loans to SMEs as these businesses still faced risks that could 
heighten in line with uncertain economic recovery .

The k ey challenge is to find a mechanism to ensure a more widespread and targeted 
liquidit y distribution .  
In the current context with ample liquidity and low financing costs, introducing 
measures to inject additional liquidity into the financial system would not directly 
address the problem . The Committee noted that apart from the monetary policy that must 
remain accommodative to support the economic growth, a key challenge is to expedite 
liquidity distribution to those who were affected  the most . Having a mechanism to 
mitigate risks of borrow ers amid highly uncertain situations would thus be of great 
importance . The Committee supported the government and related agencies to implement 
measures to reduce credit risks of borrowers, especially SMEs which were driver s and key 
employment sources of the Thai economic system . Such measures included , for example, 
credit guarantee schemes by the Thai Credit Guarantee Corporation to reduce credit 
costs of borrowers by increasing guarantee amount and guarantee ratio to appropriate 
levels, together with exp anding lists of entrepreneurs qualified for the credit guarantee 
schemes . This would ensure a more widespread liquidity distribution to SMEs with growth 
potential but were affected by the impacts of COVID -19.

The Bank of Thailand (BOT ) is committed to developing the Thai financial market 
and the FX market to be continuously effective by accelerating the development of the 
new FX ecosystem , in which capital movement is more balanced, the baht is stable and 
flexible in both directions driven by market forces,  and businesses have greater access to FX -
hedging instruments with lower costs from greater competition among providers . These 
factors would help address  the structural problems of the FX market, which would prepare the 
Thai economy to cope with financial markets ’ volatility in the future .   
In the past,  the baht  and 
regional  currencies ’ movement was 
mainly determined by external factors . 
Data from the past 5 years indicates 
that the baht moved in line with foreign 
currencies as high as 85  percent  of 
daily changes, a rate close to other 
regional currencies (Chart  1). Meanwhil e, 
domestic  factors played a secondary 
role in influencing the currency 
movement . Nevertheless , there 
remain ed a number of important 
structural issues in the Thai FX 
market,  which led to the baht ’s recent 
appreciation and made Thai businesses  
more vulnerable to currency movement 
than their peers in other countries . 
These structural problems include :   
1. Foreign capital movement is unbalanced . During the past 5 years, Thail and 
attracted high capital inflows from continuously high current account surplus at 8  percent  of 
GDP per year on average, while capital outflows for direct investment and foreign  portfolio  
investment stood at merely 4  percent  per year on average . This is  in part because Thai 
investors acquired fewer  foreign assets compared with other countries , and are more likely to 
invest in domestic assets (high home bias ) (Chart 2).

 2. The Thai corporate sector insufficiently manages FX risks . Businesses  can 
manage FX risk through various methods such as the purchase and sale of forward and option 
contracts . However, Thai businesses engaged in FX hedging at merely 19  percent of export 
values and 24  percent  of import values (Chart  3), the rates of which  should be higher .   
3. FX transactions remain costly . This is one of the obstacle s preventing Thai 
investors from diversifying their portfolio to include  foreign assets , which leads  to limited FX 
hedging among Thai businesses . 99percent  of FX transactions remain concentrated among 
commercial banks and FX transaction fees in Thailand are higher than regional peers, as 
reflected by the fee s in currency exchange and international transfer at 6 .6 percent  per 
transaction (Chart  4). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4. Baht transactions in offshore  markets highly influence exchange rate . The 
volume of baht transactions in offshore markets has continued to grow, currently accounting 
for 61  percent  of all baht transactions . The sizable offshore markets increasingly allow the 
global financial  markets ’ volatility to affect the baht and undermine the central bank ’s currency 
management ability (Chart  5).

measures to advance the development of the new FX ecosystem for Thailand to 
address structural issues of the FX market in a sustainable manner . This would require 
collaboration from various st akeholders including both the government and the private sector 
to jointly advance well -integrated measures striving for tangible results . The BOT devises the 
plan into four  aspects (Chart  6) as follows . 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
The first aspect : shaping the FX investment ecosystem  to bring about balanced 
capital movement through direct investment and investment in foreign assets . The BOT has 
implemented changes to the procedures and regulation s seen as obstacles to make foreign -
asset investment easier, more flex ible, and close to investing in domestic assets by   
1. Liberalizing foreign currency deposit (FCD) accounts  to make it easier  for Thai 
people to use FCD accounts domestically , including deposit, withdrawal , and 
transfer between Thai citizens within Thailand;  
2. Simplifying  rules and procedures , such as (1) increasing the investment limit for 
retail investors to 5 million U.S. dollars  per year , (2) abolishing the total investment 
limit that the BOT allocated to investors regulated under the Securities and 
Exchange Commission (SEC), and (3) expanding the class of foreign -currency -
denominated products that can be offered in Thailand to be more diverse, for 
example, trade in gold, exchange traded fund , and U.S. dollar  deposit receipt;  
3. Promoting the private sector ’s investment  abroad , including  both entrepreneurs ’ 
direct investment and institutional investors ’ security investment, such as insurance 
companies and provident funds . 
The second aspect : adjusting FX regulatory framework  to be in line with the 
changing economic and financial -market contexts . The framework would also be conducive 
for Thai businesses to manage FX risks more freely and for the economy to better withstand 
currency volatility . Three measures would be executed simultaneously , including (1) adjusting 
regulation for capital inflows and outflows to be more balanced , (2) reducing barriers to the 
private sector ’s FX risk management, and (3) reducing administrative burden when businesses 
declare FX transactions .

costs, increase financial products to meet the demand,  and enhance access of retail 
providers  through promot ing competition among providers . Examples include, (1) expanding 
the scope of FX transactions offered by existing providers and supporting new providers, 
particularly non -banks whose services remain lim ited in scope , and (2) changing regulation to 
suit new types of financial services  such as online transactions and digital platforms in line 
with the changing behavior  of users .   
The fourth aspect : improving monitoring and effectiveness of FX surveillance  
and management policy  to timely alert the governmen t of risks and to prepare policies  to 
cope if crises arise . These improvements include, for example, (1) increasing bath 
transactions in onshore markets by supporting non -residents who perform trade and 
investment activities in Thailand to transact with banks operating in Thailand with greater 
convenience . (2) Improving the monitoring system on investors ’ behavior  which might affect 
the stability of the baht, for example, by requiring bond pre -trade registration . (3) Preparing 
plans and measures in FX management that can be i mplemented readily and are well -
targeted .   
The aim to accelerate the development of the new FX ecosystem is an important 
policy agenda that the BOT and other related agencies wou ld continue to implement  
starting from the measure s announced on 20 November 202012/ which entail (1) allowing Thai 
citizens to freely deposit foreign currencies , (2) adjusting  regulation and procedures for 
foreign -asset investment , and (3) requiring registration for identify ing individuals for bond 
transactions . Following this, the BOT and other agencies would continue to announce 
additional measures covering the four aspects to advance the Thai FX market towards the 
new ecosystem, which would allow more balanced capital movement, greater convenience 
and higher volume of Thais ’ investment in foreign assets, more flexibility for businesses ’ FX 
risk management , and greater vigilance and timely implementation  for the government . If all 
players in the FX market successfully adjust themselves towards the new ecosystem, this 
would bring sustainable solutions to the existing structural impediments in the market .

Ecosystem (20 November 2020 )   
Monetary Policy Report  December 2020                                                                                                                      47  Moving towards the Thai economic goals  
through accelerating structural reforms  
Recently, the Thai economy has confronte d structural problems . Therefore, the 
growth potential of the  Thai economy has continued to fall which posed challenges to 
attaining economic objectives , including (1) growth , (2) income distribution , and (3) 
sustainability and resiliency to negative factors . The spread of COVID -19 in 2020 not only 
led to short -term economic contraction but left economic scars with long -term consequences 
on the Thai economy , such as severe repercussion on employment and SMEs . If the 
unemployed  are unable to reenter the labo r markets and firms cannot resume operation for a 
prolonged p eriod, productivity growth would fall, and inequality and economic vulnerability 
would rise . Thus , necessary structural reforms must be accelerated  now along the short -term 
economic stimulus to help Thailand attain the three economic goals . 
Thailand should  increase long -term growth potential through labo r, capital accumulation 
and productivity . 
Based on supply -side perspectives, growth potential consists of 3 factors , 
namely (1) quantity and quality o f labo r, (2) capital accumulation , and (3) productivity . 
Nevertheless, all these 3 factors have confronte d structural limitations  recently , culminating in 
a fall in the growth potential (Chart  1). Regarding  the quantity of labo r, Thailand entering an 
aging society  has led to  the declines in labor participation rate and the number of working 
hours . Meanwhile, considering labor’s quality , the Thai labo r market has met with  greater 
skill mismatch problem s, particularly durin g the time in which businesses are more pron e to 
use labo r-replacing technology, causing  
slower growth in labo r productivity and 
affecting income distribution . As with 
capital accumulation , the private 
sector lacks incentives to  expand 
investment and develop technologies, 
partly due to (1) the concern over the 
uncertain global economic condit ions, 
(2) the low number of countries with 
which Thailand has signed free trade 
agreement (FTA) relative to Thailand ’s 
competitors , and (3) the unfavorable 
investment ecosystem as the Thai 
private sector remains highly concentrated  
and market power of larg e businesses tends to increase . Meanwhile,  SMEs have limited 
access to capital and information in the digital economic system . Furthermore, a fundamental 
factor to uplifting productivity over the long term is government regulation, which at the 
present remains an obstacle to businesses ’ decision making . Therefore, streamlining 
regulation and facilitating business operation would help to increase the country ’s 
competitiveness through reducing opportunity costs and expenses as well as  creating the 
climate attracting foreign investment and transfer of technological know -how.

Monetary Policy Report  December 2020                                                                                                                      48  Supply -side reforms would help augment effectiveness and reduce limitations to 
macroeconomic policy  
In the short term when the Thai economy contracts from the COVID -19 effects, it is 
necessary for the government to implement  demand management policies  by conducting 
policy mix between fiscal policy that helps sustain economic momentum as well as  provide s 
targeted support to the vulnerable groups,  and monetary policy that is accommodative and 
facilitates  continuously low financing  costs . In addition, financial and credit  measures help to 
accelerate the distribution of liquidity targeted to those in need, along with debt restructuring 
appropriate to businesses ’ income flows under the post -COVID19 new normal . 
 Nevertheless, supply -side reforms aimed at uplifting production potential need 
to be urgently  executed alongside the demand stimulus measures . This is because 
demand management policies alone might not be effective if the institutional frameworks of 
the economy are not fully developed13/. Examples include, such as , restructuring the labo r 
market  particularly labo r upskilling and reskilling to prepare workers for employment in 
targeted industries and to facilitate  economic transition  towards the post -pandemic new 
normal . Others include having a mechanism that manages excess capacity of certain 
business sectors  particularly those related to tourism, encouraging business operations in 
line with the post -pandemic normal . In addition, improving basic infrastructure for the digital 
economy  to be comprehensive and inclusive would help reduce inequality in income 
distribut ion. In addition, there is a need for creating a sustainable welfare system  for the aging 
society , as well as effective coordination among government agencies . The absence of 
structural reforms to cope with changes under the  post-pandemic new normal would pose 
limitations to macroeconomic policy in the future  (Chart 2 ).

help achieve the three economic goals  
Focusing solely on high growth rate is not sufficient for achieving all three 
economic goals . Growth needs to be inclusive to reduce pockets of  economic 
vulnerability and needs to be sustainable and stable . Uplifting growth potential along with 
promoting equitable income distribution in a sustainable manner is th erefore critical since the 
realized  benefits would not only manifest in the present , but also in the long term to the next 
generations . Structural reforms coupled with demand -stimulating policies to attain all 
three economic goals warrant an urgent and sustained implementation,  requiring clearly 
identifying priorities, introducing implementation guidelines, creating incentives and appropriate 
integration . Therefore, coordination among government agencies  and collaboration with the 
private sector will be the hea rt for an inclusive and sustainable economic growth in the periods ahead
