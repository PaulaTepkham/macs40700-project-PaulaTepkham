Monetary Policy Report  
 
 
The Monetary Policy Report  is prepared quarterly by staff of the 
Bank of Thailand with the approval of the Monetary Policy Committee 
(MPC).  It serves two purposes: ( 1 )  to communicate to the public the  
MPC’s consideration and rationales for the conduct of monetary policy,  
and (2)  to present the latest set of economic and inflation forecasts, based 
on which the monetary policy decisions were made.

Monetary Policy in Thailand  
Monetary Policy Committee  
Under the Bank of Thailand Act, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) comprise s the governor 
and two deputy governors, as well as four distinguished external members representing various 
sectors of the economy , with the aim of ensuring  that monetary policy decisions are effective and 
transparent.  
Monetary Policy Objective   
The MPC implements monetary policy under  the flexible inflation targeting regime. While regarding 
medium–term price stability  as its primary objective, the MPC also aims at supporting sustainable , 
full-potential economic growth and preserving financial stability, attributing to long -term price s tability  
and economic sustainability  
Monetary Policy Target  
On December  24, 2019, the Cabinet approved the monetary policy target for 2020, which was 
mutually agreed between the MPC  and the Minister of Finance  to set t he headline inflation  within 
the range  of 1–3 percent as the target for the medium -term horizon and for 2020.  
In the event  that average headline inflation in the past 12 months or a forecast of average headline 
inflation over  12 months ahead breach es the target  range, the MPC shall send  an ope n letter to 
the Minister of Finance to explain  reasons  for the breach of the target range,  together with 
measures taken and estimated time to bring inflation back to the target . In addition, the MPC will 
write an additional open letter to the Minister of F inance every six months if average headline 
inflation based on  the above criteria remains outside the target range . 
Monetary Policy Instrument  
The MPC utilizes the 1 -day bilateral repurchase transaction rate as the policy interest rate to signal 
the monet ary policy stance.  
Evaluation of Economic Conditions and Forecasts  
The Bank of Thailand takes into account  information from all sources, the macroeconomic model, 
data from each economic sector, as well as surveys  of large enterprises , together with  small and 
medium -sized enterprises from all over the country, and various financial institutions  to ensure that 
economic evaluations and forecasts are accurate and cover all aspects, both at the macro and 
micro levels.  
Monetary Policy Communication  
Recognizing the importance of monetary policy communication to the public, the MPC employs  
various  channel s of communication, both in Thai and English, such as (1) organizing a press 
statement at 14 :00 on the day of the Committee meeting, (2) publishing edited minutes of the MPC 
meeting two weeks after the meeting, and (3) publishing the Monetary Policy Report  every quarter.

Monetary Policy Conduct in the First Quarter of 2020  
At the meeting on February 5, 2020, the Committee voted unanimously to cut the policy rate by 0.25 
percentage point from 1.25 to 1.00 percent.  The Committee  assessed that the Thai economy would 
expand at a much lower rate than the previous forecast and much further below its potential due to the 
coronavirus (COVID -19) outbreak, the delayed Annual Budget Expenditure Act, and the drought. In this 
situation, the re was an urgent need to coordinate financial  and fiscal measures , as well as to support liquidity 
provision and debt restructuring for businesses and households. Later  on March 20, 2020, the Committee  
held a special meeting  and voted unanimously to cut th e policy rate by 0.25 percentage point from 
1.00 to 0.75 percent, effective on March 23, 2020. This was because  the impact of the COVID -19 outbreak  
in the period ahead would be more severe than previously expected , which would severely affect the Thai 
economy.  The outbreak also raised concerns among  global financial markets  and affected liquidity of Thai 
financial markets. At the meeting on March 25, 2020, the Committee voted 4 to 2 to maintain the policy 
rate at 0.75 percent. Two members voted to cut t he policy rate by 0.25 percentage point , while one 
MPC member did not vote1  . The Committee  viewed that the economic and inflation outlook remained 
consistent with the assessment at the special meeting. Most members would wait to assess the adjustment 
in the financial markets as well as additional reduction in interest rates by financial institutions . Most members 
deemed it appropriate to preserve policy space. Meanwhile, all members  viewed that the government’s 
announced relief measures and the loan repay ment measures to assist borrowers affected by the COVID -
19 were more targeted in addressing the problems. However, two members voted to cut the policy rate by 
0.25 percentage point, as the extra accommodative monetary policy would in their view be commensu rate 
with the significant economic contraction . 
Looking ahead, the Committee would stand ready to use additional policy tools in an appropriate 
and timely manner.  Such tools included the policy rate and other financial  measures that would help 
enhance the policy rate transmission as well as loan extension by financial institutions to reach the target 
groups.  
Assessment of the Economic and Financial Outlook as the Basis for Policy Formulation  
1. Global Economy  
The global economy was projected to slow down significantly as the COVID -19 pandemic severely  
affected tourism, manufacturing, and exporting sectors, as well as private consumption. The outbreak also 
led to excessive volatility in the global financial mark ets. Major advanced economies were expected to enter 
into a recession in 2020. The Committee thus revised down economic growth projections for 
Thailand’s trading partners to  .  percent in      and  .  percent in     .  Nonetheless, risks that 
trading partner economies would underperform the baseline projection increased.  Such risks 
included, for example, the COVID -19 outbreak which could become more severe and prolong ed than 
expected, and financial stability risks which could deteriorate in many countr ies. On the other hand, there 
were possibilities that trading partners’ economic growth would outperform the baseline projection owing to 
a faster -than-expected ending of the outbreak due to a successful development of vaccines or medicines, 
or larger -than-expected effects of financial  and fiscal measures in many countries in stimulating the economy.  
Governments and central banks in various countries worldwide promptly released measures to 
alleviate the impact of the COVID -19 outbreak.  Such m easures include d greater government spending  
and extra accommodative monetary polic y in conjunction with measures to safeguard financial stability and 
                                            
1  The MPC member attended the meeting through video conference to consider the economic outlook, financial 
stability, and the appropriate monetary policy  formulation but did not vote.   
 
Monetary Policy Report  March 2020                                                                                                                      6 provide liquidity to financial markets. The Federal Reserve (Fed) held two unscheduled meetings in March 
2020  and decide d to cut the policy rate to a range of 0.00 -0.25 percent and announced to purchase Treasury 
and agency mortgage -backed securities as much as needed to support the well -functioning of the financial 
markets. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank  of Japan (BOJ) maintained negative 
policy rates and announced additional liquidity measures. Regional central banks eased their monetary 
policy further and also introduced measures to ensure stability of the financial markets following sustained 
capital o utflows.  
2. Financial Conditions and Financial Stability  
Thai financial markets encountered volatilities similar to  global financial markets.  In March, 
investors’ concerns over the COVID -19 pandemic increased, causing Thai government bond yields to 
rise ra pidly across all tenors. However, BOT measures helped improve stability of the financial 
markets. These measures included government bond purchase s, the policy rate cut at the 
special meeting, and measures to stabilize the Thai financial markets.  As a resu lt, government 
bond yields declined and overall financial conditions became more accommodative, partly reflected in 
the decreased lending rates. Meanwhile, overall corporate financing remained mostly unchanged . 
Financial institutions became more tightened in extending loans  in line with economic conditions. 
Therefore, the BOT, together with related agencies, continued to implement measures to assist borrowers  
affected by the outbreak. These measures included both liquidity provision and debt restructuring. With 
regard to exchange rates, the baht against the U.S. dollar and the real effect exchange rate (REER) 
index depreciated considerably from the previous quarter.   
The financial system faced greater risks from the short -term impact of the COVID -19 outbreak , 
although stability of financial institutions, external, and fiscal sectors, remained robust. Further  risks 
that warranted monitoring were as follows.  First, some investors rushed to redeem their investment units in 
daily fixed income funds, which were op en for daily redemption, especially the funds investing in foreign 
assets. Some mutual funds therefore sold off their government bonds, thereby impacting liquidity and the 
functioning of the financial markets. Second, corporate bonds default risks increase d in tandem with 
economic conditions, triggering knock -on effects to other related parties in the financial system, including 
cross -default and some saving cooperatives with corporate bond holdings. Third, ability to manage liquidity 
and debt servicing abi lity of households and businesses deteriorated. This could impact decisions to extend 
loans of financial institutions and in turn affect economic activities , resulting in a  negative feedback loop. 
Fourth, oversupply in the real estate market was expected t o rise due to falling demand for housing.  
3. Economic and Inflation Outlook  
The economy would contract  significantly , expanding at a much lower rate than the assessment in 
the previous  Monetary Policy Report . The Thai economy was expected to contract 5.3 percent in 
2020 but would recover and expand 3.0 percent in 2021 . The economy would remain at a level below 
its potential throughout the forecast horizon. This was mainly owing to the severe impact of the COVID -
19 outbreak. In addition, farm income would b e depressed by the drought, while public expenditure would 
experience a larger impact than previously assessed due to the delayed enactment of the Annual Budget 
Expenditure Act, B.E. 2563 (A.D. 2020). Nevertheless, government’s implemented measures would b e the 
key mechanism to alleviate the impact on the economy despite being unable to offset a significant contraction  
in aggregate demand.  
Assumptions underlying the economic projection in this Report  includ e (1) the COVID -19 outbreak in 
Thailand would be co ntained within the second quarter of 2020 according to the Ministry of Public Health 
estimate, and (2) the projection took into account financial  and fiscal measures implemented before March 
25, 2020, not including any  measures  thereafter .   
 
Monetary Policy Report  March 2020                                                                                                                      7 The value of Thai merchandise exports in 2020 would markedly shrink both in terms of volume and 
prices. Export volume would be affected by the COVID -19 outbreak, which resulted in a significant demand 
slowdown of trading partner economies and supply chain disruptions. Meanwhile, export prices would 
significantly decline in line with crude oil prices. However, the value of merchandise exports was expected 
to expand slightly in 2021 once the spread of COVID -19 subsided. Nevertheless, the Committee assessed 
that the value of merchandise exports would contract 8.8 percent in 2020, before expanding sl ightly 
at 0.2 percent in 2021.  
Exports of services was expected to severely contract as the COVID -19 outbreak led to travel 
restrictions  that affected foreign touris t figures of all nationalities. Moreover, there would also be an impact 
on tourist spending per head. However, the number of foreign tourists was expected to gradually improve in 
the second half of 2020. Nevertheless, tourists would start to travel once th e vaccines for the coronavirus 
were to be widely distributed.  The number of foreign tourists was projected to be 15.0 and 20.0 million 
in 2020 and 2021, respectively.  
The current account balance was projected to register a surplus of 19.4 and 19.2 billion U.S. dollar s 
in 2020 and 2021, respectively. The services balance was revised from being in surplus to deficit, as tourist 
receipts declined considerably in line with  the decline in the number of tourists and spending per head. 
Meanwhile, the trade balance  was expected to record a larger surplus due to a large contraction in imports 
value. Import volume contracted in line with imports of raw materials, intermediate and capital goods, while 
import prices declined in tandem with global crude oil prices.   
Private consumption was expected to contract in 2020, which was the first contraction since 2009. 
Suspension  of a wide range of economic activities affected consumption in the services and away -from-
home  spending categories. Meanwhile, farm income was expected  to decline due to a more -severe -than-
expected impact of the drought. However, government measures to alleviate the impact of the COVID -19 
outbreak would partly help relieve the  impact on private consumption to a certain level.  
Private investment was proj ected to contract in 2020 in line with both domestic and external demand.  
However, private investment was expected to improve in 2021 thanks to a gradual recovery in exports, 
the PPP projects in infrastructure investment projects that had been postponed, as well as a greater clarity 
pertaining to investment in the 5G network following the auction in the first quarter  of 2020.  
Public expenditure, both consumption and investment, was expected to expand and would be a key 
driver of the Thai economy. However, although government agencies adjusted the procurement process 
for a faster disbursement, this could not offset the impact of the delayed enactment of the Annual Budget 
Expenditure Act in the previous period. SOE investment was revised down in line with pro ject postponement 
and a lower fiscal budget on transportation projects. Meanwhile, the first and second package s of 
government measures to mitigate the impact of the COVID -19 outbreak, totaling 464 billion baht or 2.8 
percent of GDP (excluding tax relief m easures worth approximately 260 billion baht or 1.5 percent of GDP), 
were mostly measures on credit and transfers. This was expected to directly cushion  private consumption 
and investment, not through public consumption and investment.   
Headline inflation would be negative due to  the sharp decline in  crude oil and energy prices . Core 
inflation was expected to be negative  as well  in line with a large decrease in demand -pull inflationary 
pressures. Headline inflation was projected to be negative at -1.0 perce nt in 2020, before gradually 
increasing to 0.3 percent in 2021 consistent with  the gradual economic recovery outlook. However, 
headline inflation would remain  below the inflation target.  
Economic and inflation projections were highly uncertain and mainly depended on the situation of 
the COVID -19 spread and the success of the  containment  measures. Risks to the projections tilted 
downward . The possibilities that the Thai economy would underp erform the baseline projection 
would be due to  the following factors. F irst, the global economy could enter into a recession should the  
 
Monetary Policy Report  March 2020                                                                                                                      8 outbreak become more severe and prolonged than expected, exerting additional adverse impact s on 
Thailand’s merchandise e xports. Second, global financial stability  risks might affect the Thai economy in the 
medium term. Third, Thailand’s tourism might not recover in the second half of 2020 if the outbreak in 
Thailand and other countries could not be contained within the seco nd quarter of 2020. Fourth, the 
government might need to implement stricter measures to control the outbreak, which might cause some 
businesses to shut down operations or significantly reduce employment. Fifth, more -severe -than-expected 
impact of the droug ht could affect farm income. However,  there were possibilities that the Thai economy 
would outperform the baseline projection due to (1) a faster -than-expected development of vaccines and 
medicines for the COVID -19, (2) better -than-expected impacts of additional government’s stimulus 
measures and measures to assist borrowers, and (3) a higher -than-expected domestic demand as a result 
of public infrastructure investment and PPP projects, which might incentivize the private sector to in vest 
more  and faster. M oreover, there remained downside risks to headline and core inflation projections  
in line with risks to crude oil prices and  the economic growth projection.

The COVID -19 pandemic significantly weighed on the outlook of Thailand’s trading partner 
economies, particularly major advanced economies that were expected to enter into a 
recession in 2020. However, financial and fiscal measures would help alleviate the impact 
and shore up the economy in the period ahead . 
In the  fourth quarter of 2019, the U.S. economy  expanded with growth rate largely 
unchanged from the  previous quarter. Exports improved , while  private consumption could still 
grow on account of robust labor markets and acc ommodative monetary conditions. Meanwhile,  
private investment continued to contract. The euro area economy  expanded at a slower pace 
due to country -specific factors  in certain countries . For example, the protest  in France  against 
the pension reforms toward the end of the year led private  consumption to decelerate.  The 
Japanese economy  contracted, as private consumption was affected by an increase in 
consumption tax in October, while investment and manufacturing sector  also contracted as a 
result of Typhoon Hagibis.  
In 2020, major advanced  economies were projected to continue to contract and 
enter into a recession as a result of the COVID -19 pandemic . Private consumption and 
tourism -related businesses were severely affected as the U.S. imposed travel restrictions on 
European countries. Several European countries announced border closures and lockdown 
of cities, as well as advised its citizens against all but essential travel. Japan also announced 
a postponement of the Summer Olympic Games. Meanwhile, production and exports in certain 
industries, such as automotive and electronics, encountered supply chain disruptions, while 
the U.S. energy sector was a ffected by a significant fall in oil prices. Nevertheless, financial 
and fiscal measures which were already implemented  and forthcoming  would help alleviate 
the impact and shore up the economies of major advanced countries in the period ahead.  
The Chinese  and Asian economies expanded at a slower pace due to the COVID -19 
outbreak. However, financial and fiscal measures would help alleviate the impact and 
support the economic expansion to some extent . 
The Chinese economy in the 
fourth quarter of 2019 expand ed at a 
pace similar to that of the previous 
quarter.  Exports and investment improved, 
while private consumption slowed down 
slightly. In 2020,  the Chinese economy 
was projected to slow down significantly  
as a result of the COVID -19 outbreak, which 
started  to intensify since the Chinese New 
Year. The Chinese authorities, therefore, 
announced a lockdown of several major 
cities, particularly in Hubei province,  and 
extended holiday  period s. This resulted in  
a severe impact on economic activities, 
especially in the manufacturing sector.

Monetary Policy Report  March 2020                                                                                                                      10 (Chart 1.1).  Although the number of new infections in China fell significantly and the authorities 
allowed some  businesses to resume operations after the extended holiday s, quarantine 
measures and travel restrictions between cities that remained in place prevented businesses 
from performing full operations. Moreover, since there were still infected  patients travelling into 
China , it would take some time before the situation ret urned to normal. Nevertheless, fiscal 
measures which were continuously introduced would in part help to alleviate the impact and 
prevent the Chinese economy from entering into a recession.  
In the fourth quarter of 2019, 
Asian economies (excluding Japan an d 
China) expanded at a slower pace than 
the previous quarter . This was because 
production and exports continued to be 
affected by trade tensions, as reflected in  
a slower -than-expected recovery in global  
trade volume (Chart 1.2).  Moreover, prolonged  
protests in Hong Kong resulted in continued  
contraction of the economy. In 2020, Asian 
economies were projected to slow down 
significantly from the previous assessment , 
as the COVID -19 spread to many countries  
such as South Korea, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and the Philippines. Moreover, nationwide or 
citywide lockdown measures imposed  by many countries weighed on private consumption and 
tourism sector. Meanwhile, the manufacturing and export sectors were affected by supply chain  
disruptions from linkages with  China’s production chain , and slower -than-expected recovery 
of the electronics cycle. Nevertheless, governments in many countries had introduced  stimulus 
measures which should help support the recovery of Asian economies in the period ahead.  
The COVID -19 outbreak and a sharp fall in oil prices contributed to excessive volatility in 
the global financial markets, both in major advanced economies and emerging market s. 
In the first quarter of 2020, concerns in the global financial markets  heightened, 
triggerin g risk-off sentiment , as a result of the COVID -19 outbreak and a marked decline in oil 
prices. This was reflected in a sharp increase in the VIX Index2/ since  late February. Investors 
thus continued to sell off  their risky assets . This was  particularly the case in major advanced 
economies , where massive  equity sell -offs led to  sharp plummets of  stock market indices and 
triggered circuit breaker s in some countries. As a result , long -term U.S. treasury yield s were 
volatile , reaching historical low levels at the beginning of March. This was due to increased 
demand for U.S. treasuries following a fall in prices of risky assets. However, U.S. treasury 
yields rose rapid ly in the middle of March, as investors cut their holdings of all types of assets, 
including safe-haven  asset s, in exchange for  U.S. dollar cash. The sharp surge in demand for 
U.S. dollars in the global financial markets resulted in a dollar liquidity squeeze , as reflected 
in a more negative cross currency basis  (Chart 1.3).  Meanwhile, U.S. corpor ate bond yields 
rose markedly due to  concerns over debt servic ing ability of affected businesses.

In emerging markets, there were signs of capital outflows since when the outbreak was 
still contained in China and Asia. Outflows, from both equity and bond markets , then increased  
since late  February  (Chart 1.4), causing  the stock market index to fall sharply and government 
bond yields to rise. Overall global financial conditions tightened significantly. Going forward, 
the global financial markets would remain highly volatile due to short -term risks . These 
includ ed uncertainties regarding the impact of COVID -19 on the economy and financial 
stabil ity, as well as  competition on  price s and production volume among major oil  produc ers, 
which would weigh on the outlook of both oil and commodity prices  in the period ahead.

Monetary Policy Report  March 2020                                                                                                                      12 Governments world wide introduced financial and fiscal measures in order to alleviate the 
economic impact of COVID -19 and curb volatilities in the financial markets.  
Governments in various countries worldwide promptly released measures to 
mitigate the impact of the economic slowdown. In major advanced economies and 
emerging markets, governments announced a series of measures to shore up the 
economy, as well as introduced targeted measures.  This particularly included measures to 
support businesses and SMEs, and m easures to  support households and employment. 
Meanwhile, advanced economies ’ central banks eased their monetary policy further.  
The Federal Reserve (Fed) cut its policy rate from 1.50 -1.75 percent to 0.00 -0.25 percent in 
two unscheduled meetings in March 2020. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank (ECB) kept 
its policy rate at a low level and injected liquidity in the financial system through longer -term 
refinancing operations (LTROs). Moreover, the ECB undertook targeted  longer -term refin ancing 
operations (TLTROs) in order to support credit extension  by financial institutions  to the real 
economy. The Bank of Japan (BOJ) maintained its policy rate at a low level, expanded its 
asset purchases in the equity market, and introduced Special Fund s-Supplying Operations in 
order to facilitate greater access to credits for businesses. Regional central banks  also 
eased their monetary policy further  by cutting the policy rates in order to help mitigate the 
economic impact of the COVID -19 outbreak. Some  central banks introduced measures to 
reduce financial costs for borrowers, such as temporary debt moratorium  measures , and a 
low-interest loan program for financial institutions to extend credits to the private sector.  
In addition , many countries  simultan eously  introduced measures to safeguard 
stability  of the financial markets  stemming from tightening liquidity conditions in the global 
financial markets . The Fed injected liquidity in the bond market through the purchases of 
treasuries and agency mortgage -backed securities in the amounts  as much as needed to 
support the well –functioning of the financial markets.  Moreover, the Fed  established facilities 
to support the issuance s of bonds in the primary and secondary markets3/, and also  injected 
liquidity into the financial institutions ’ system via the establishments of various funds . This 
would ensure sustained flows of credit from financial institutions to businesses and 
households4/. Meanwhile, the ECB increased the size of its purcha ses of government and 
corporate bonds  via the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program (PEPP) worth 750 billion 
euros. The program was made more flexible than the previous one, for instance, by allowing 
extensive  holdings of bonds  issued by any single member co untry. Regional central banks 
announced measures to ensure stability of the financial markets following sustained 
capital outflows.  These  included increasing the purchases of government bonds , as well as 
providing liquidity via other instruments such as FX  swap transactions, expanding the set of 
                                            
3/  The Fed established the Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility (PMCCF) and the Secondary Market Corporate 
Credit Facility (SMCCF) to support credit extension to large corporates. The facilities would purchase newly 
issued investment grade corporate bonds in the primary market, and purchase debt securities and exchange -
traded funds (ETFs) in the secondary market.  
4/ The liquidity facilities included following examples. (1) Under the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF), the Fed 
would extend credit to its primary dealers. The loan would be fully collateralized with maturities up to 90 days. 
(2) Under the Money Market  Liquidity Facility (MMLF), the Fed would provide liquidity, with maximum maturities 
of 12 months, to financial institutions to purchase assets from primary money market fund according to conditions 
under the MMLF. (3) Under the Term Asset -Backed Securitie s Loan Facility (TALF), the Fed would extend loans 
fully collateralized by eligible asset -backed security (ABS) to finance student, auto, and credit card loans. This 
would increase flows of credit to households and businesses.   
 
Monetary Policy Report  March 2020                                                                                                                      13 eligible collaterals for open market operations, and cutting reserve requirement ratio (RRR). 
Meanwhile, some  countries announced temporary closures of their financial markets5/.  
Growth projections for Thailand’s t rading partner economies in 2020 were revised down 
significantly due to impact of the COVID -19. In 2021, however, trading partner economies 
were expected to recover once the spread gradually subsided. Nonetheless, risks that 
trading partner economies would  underperform the baseline projection increased, as the 
COVID -19 pandemic could become more severe and prolonged than expected . 
Trading partner economies in 2020 were expected to expand at  a much  slower 
pace th an previously assessed  in the previous Monetary Policy Report . This was 
because global  COVID -19 pandemic severely affected manufacturing, consumption, and 
investment. Moreover, the services sector was significantly disrupted and was expected  to 
recover more slowly than  the manufacturing sector.  Nevertheless, private consumption would 
be somewhat supported by falling oil prices . At the same time, financial and fiscal measures 
that were already implemented and forthcoming w ould partly help shore up the economy.  
In 2021, the COVID -19 outbreak was expected to gradually subside . Consequently, trading 
partner economies would somewhat  recover. The Committee thus revised down economic 
growth projections for Thailand’s trading partners to  .  percent in      and  .  
percent in 2021  (Table 1.1).

Monetary Policy Report  March 2020                                                                                                                      14 The Committee assessed that there were higher possibilities that trading partner 
economies would underperform the baseline projection, as the COVID -19 outbreak 
could become more severe and prolonged than expected. Moreover, there were other 
risk facto rs, such as (1) financial stability risks which could arise in many countries as a result 
of high volatility and tightening liquidity in the global financial markets , particular ly risks of a 
sudden stop in emerging market economies, (2) geopolitical risks which could escalate and 
weigh on the commodity market, (3) trade tensions  which could intensi fy once again , (4) 
uncertainties regarding trade deal between the European Union and the United Kingdom, and 
(5) wealth effect  arising from volatile financial mar kets and a sharp fall in asset prices .  
On the other hand, there were possibilities that trading partners’ economic growth 
would outperform the baseline projection owing to  (1) a faster -than-expected ending of 
the outbreak due to effective healthcare measu res in many countries and successful 
development of vaccines and medicines  for the COVID -19, and (2) larger -than-expected 
effects of financial and fiscal measures in many countries in stimulating the economy.  
Dubai crude oil prices in the first quarter of 2020 declined markedly from the previous 
quarter . This was  in line with the global economic slowdown as a result of the COVID -19 
outbreak and the announcement on oil price reduction by Saudi Arabia after the OPEC 
and Russia failed to reach an agreement on a crude oil production cut.  
Dubai crude oil prices in the first quarter of 2020 fell sharply from the previous 
quarter due to the following factors . First,  the COVID -19 outbreak  resulted in a lower 
demand for oil in line with the global economic conditions, particularly fuels used in 
transportation and travel. Second,  Saudi Arabia announce d a reduction on crude oil 
price s after Russia failed to agree to the OPEC’s proposal  to additionally cut o il production 
at the meeting on March 6, 2020. Saudi Arabia also intended to gain market shares from other 
higher -cost oil producers such as the U.S. Moreover, Saudi Arabia and Russia announced an 
increase in their crude oil production s by 2.5 million and 0.5 million barrels pe r day 
respectively, starting in April 2020. As a result, Dubai crude oil prices fell substantially from 
their average of  54.2 U.S. dollars per barrel in February 2020 to below 30.0 U.S. dollars per 
barrel since the middle of March 202 0 (Chart  1.5). 
Due to factors mentioned above, together with uncertainties surrounding the COVID -19 
outbreak situation that could potentially impact global oil demand  significantly , the Committee 
thus revised down the projection for Dubai crude oil prices in 2020 from 62.5 U.S. dollars 
per barrel to 35.0 U.S. dollars per barrel. In 2021 , Dubai crude oil prices were expected to 
remain low at 34.0 U.S. dollars per barrel . Crude oil prices would gradually increase in line 
with the global economic recovery and a reduction in oil supply from high -cost producers such 
as the U.S. Meanwhile, risks to the projection of Dubai crude oil prices were expected 
to tilt downward,  as the COVID -19 outbreak could become more prolonged and affect the 
global economy more than ex pected. Nevertheless, Dubai oil prices could increase somewhat 
as a result of geopolitical factors and the possibility of the OPEC and Russia reaching  
a production cut agreement.

2.1 Recent Developments  
The Thai economy in the fourth quarter of 2019 expanded at a slower pace due to both 
domestic and external demand.  
 In the fourth quarter of 2019 , the Thai economy expanded 1.6 percent from the same 
period last year. The growth rate was lower than the assessment in the previous Monetary 
Policy Report , mainly due to domestic and external demand slowdown. The prolonged contraction  
in Thai merchandise  exports prompted firms to reduce the number of workers and working 
hours. Firms also adjusted their employment pattern from monthly to daily contract. Household 
income and consumer confidence, that continued to weaken, caused private consumption to 
modera te. The government thus introduced short -term economic stimulus measures toward 
the end of 2019, which helped shore up purchasing power to some extent. However, the 
government was unable to lend sufficient support to the economy on account of the delayed 
enactment of the Annual Budget Expenditure Act, B.E. 2563 (A.D. 2020). Therefore, public 
expenditures contracted in both current and capital expenditures. Tourism growth moderated 
as a result of both the waning low base effect from the Phuket tour boat sink ing incident and 
lower tourist spending in line with slower economic growth of trading partners. Moreover, 
weaker economic activities resulted in the continued slowdown of private investment.  
The Thai economy experienced a more severe impact of the COVID -19 outbreak.  
 In the first quarter of 2020 , the Thai economy faced a more severe impact of the 
COVID -19 outbreak, which started to intensify since late January. Following the Chinese 
government’s prohibition of the Chinese outbound travel and the rapid spre ad of the virus to 
other countries, the number of foreign tourist arrivals sharply contracted in almost all nationalities.  
As a result, tourism and related businesses were severely affected. Moreover, the COVID -19 
outbreak triggered supply chain disruption s and closure of transport routes in some countries, 
further affecting Thai merchandise exports (excluding gold). Nonetheless, some Thai export 
products benefited from export substitution of Chinese goods in the U.S. market as well as 
exports of medical -related products and other basic necessities during the COVID -19 
outbreak. However, this was not sufficient to offset the negative impact of weaker demand 
from trading partners.  
 In addition, the COVID -19 outbreak resulted in broader economic impacts, especi ally 
for SMEs that were short of liquidity and had to shut down operations. As more workers  
lost their jobs and consumer confidence dropped to its lowest level in 19 years, private 
consumption indicators thus pointed to a slowdown. In particular, consumer  spending in 
services category contracted considerably, where only spending on necessities that could still 
expand. Private investment indicators further contracted, driven by substantially weaker 
domestic and external demand and problem in transporting im ported capital goods from 
China. Despite the introduction of a series of measures to alleviate the impact on those 
affected by the outbreak, the government was unable to provide a sufficient support to  
the economy in this quarter as problem regarding parl iamentary voting process to approve  
the Annual Budget Expenditure Act caused further delay in the enactment.   
 
Monetary Policy Report  March 2020                                                                                                                      17 Overall household purchasing power significantly weakened. The COVID -19 outbreak 
further affected employment and non -farm income, while the droug ht might cause a more -
severe -than-expected impact on farm income . 
 The COVID -19 outbreak further weakened an already -fragile household purchasing 
power. Non-farm households  faced greater downside risks due to changes in employment 
pattern from monthly to daily contract (Chart 2.1), temporary or partial suspension of business 
operations (Chart 2.2), and a reduction in overtime (OT)  working  hours. These downside risks, 
which h ad initially been concentrated in export -related manufacturing sectors, spread to 
tourism -related services sector, such as hotel and restaurants and retail trade. As a result, 
non-farm income declined sharply.6/  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Farm income  in 2020 was projected  to contract more than previously assessed, mainly  
due to a significantly lower agricultural output, especially off -season rice and sugarcane, as a 
result of the drought. Although prices of these agricultural products would rise somewhat due 
to the drought , the price increase would not offset the impact of such large fall in output. 
Moreover, the drought situation could be more severe than expected because the level of 
usable dam water (including dams in the northern and central regions) was at a similarly critical 
level as in 2015 -2016 (Chart 2.3), while risk of El Nino increased. Should the rainy season in 
Thailand delay, the usable dam water level would not be sufficient to support farming in the 
latter half of 2020. This would further affect output, especially in -season rice and other crops 
including cassava, vegetable, and fruits.  
 
 
                                            
6/ The COVID -19 severely affected the labor market because o ver half of tourism -related workers were 
self-employed with unstable income. Moreover, most workers were employed in jobs where “work 
from home” was not possible. For more information, please see the link Thai labor market conditions 
and outlook  (March 202 0).

Headline inflation in January -February increased due to the base effect of energy prices, 
but was projected to decline in March in line with global crude oil prices.  
 Headline inflation in the first 
two months of the first quarter of 2020 
averaged at 0.90 percent, up from 0.40 
percent in the previous quarter (Chart 
2.4). The increase was in tandem with 
the smaller decline in energy prices,  
as domestic retail oil prices decreased 
from the same period last year following 
the decision to reduce contributions to 
the Oil Fund. Fresh food inflation was 
largely unchanged from the previous 
quarter. Fresh food prices in several 
product categories decreased, such as 
vegetables and fruits, eggs and dairy 
products, as well as rice, flour, and flour  
products. However, the decrease was 
in part offset by higher meat prices, mainly in line with pork prices given lower pork output. 
Headline inflation in March was projected to f all in line with global crude oil prices.  
 Core inflation in the first two months of the first quarter of 2020 averaged at 0.53 
percent, up from 0.47 percent in the previous quarter. Food -in-core inflation increased  
(Chart 2.5), driven by higher prices of seasonings and condiments. This was partly owing to 
an increase in vegetable oil prices on account of higher palm costs. Core inflation in the  
non-food categories declined slightly in line with prices of personal ca re products (Chart 2.6). 
This was partly because firms rolled out more promotional activities. In other categories, prices 
slightly increased due to weaker demand in line with economic conditions (Table 2.1).

professional forecasters in March 2020 recorded 1.1 percent, a slight decline from 1.2 percent 
in the previous quarter. Inflation expectations based on the survey of businesses in February 
2020 stood at 1.6 percent, down s lightly from 1.7 percent in the previous quarter. Long -term 
(five-year ahead) inflation expectations  according to the survey of professional forecasters 
in October 2019 remained at 2.0 percent. In addition, long -term inflation expectations based 
on a macro -finance term structure model with bond yields and macroeconomic data stabilized 
at 1.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2019.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Short -term government bond yields and commercial banks’ interest rates fell in line with 
the policy rate. Long -term government bond yields also declined in tandem with U.S. 
treasury yields, before rising rapidly towards the end of the quarter on the back of concerns 
over the COVID -19 situation . 
 During January -February 2020, short -term money market rates and short -term  
government bond yields fell from the previous quarter in line with the policy rate cut on 
February 5, 2020 (Chart 2.7). Medium -term and long -term government bond yields  
(Chart 2.8) decreased in tandem with U.S. treasury yields, as investors viewed that t he 
COVID -19 began to become widespread from originally contained within China, which could 
significantly affect the global economy. In addition, two -year Thai government bond yields 
were subjected to additional pressures from increased demand from investor s. This was on 
account of the Ministry of Finance’s bond switching transactions in which two -year government 
bonds were set as the source bond.  Meanwhile,  overall corporate bond yields decreased 
in line with government bond yields.

all tenors after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID -19 as a pandemic. 
Foreign investors quickly sold off Thai government bonds in exchange for cash in U.S. dollars . 
Meanwhile, some domestic investors rushed to redeem their investment units in daily fixed 
income funds, which allowed for daily redemption, especially the funds investing in foreign 
assets. Some mutual funds thus sold off quality assets before their matu rities, particularly  
Thai government bonds, in order to have enough cash to return to unitholders. Consequently,  
Thai government bond yields rose quickly in some tenors, putting a strain on the liquidity and 
functioning of the financial markets. This was  reflected in the abnormally high bid -ask spreads. 
However, Thai government bond yields decreased slightly, thanks to the Bank of Thailand’s 
government bond purchase program to provide liquidity in the bond markets, the policy rate 
cut at the special meeti ng of the MPC on March 20, 2020, and the joint announcement of 
measures to stabilize the Thai financial markets in corp oration with related agencies. As a 
result, mutual funds slowed their sell -off of government bonds to some extent (Box: Measures  
to stabi lize the Thai financial markets  in chapter 3 ).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The five largest commercial banks reduced lending rates in all categories  
in February and March 2020. The average minimum loan rates (MLR) decreased to 5.93 
percent, the average minimum retail rates (MRR) slightly declined to 6.66 percent, and the 
average minimum overdraft rates (MOR) fell to 6.64 percent (Chart 2.9). Meanwhile, the new 
loan rates (NLR)7/ in January 2020 remained low at 3.83 percent (Chart 2.10). Deposit rates  
of the top five co mmercial banks continued to decline in tandem with lending rates, especially 
for 3-month, 6 -month and 12 -month fixed deposits as well as savings rates (Chart 2.11).

Private sector financing remained mostly unchanged from the end of the fourth quarter of 
2019.  Business credit expanded at a slightly faster pace, while household credit slowed 
down slightly.  
Private credit8/ expanded 3.4 percent in January 2020 (Chart 2.12), largely unchanged  
from December 2019, after having decelerated in 2019 in line with economic conditions. 
Business credits expanded slightly  by 2.2 percent in January 2020, as  business loans 
contracted slightly by 0.6 percent while corporate bond issuance grew at a relatively steady 
pace of 13.1 percent (Chart 2.13). Real estate and manufacturing businesses continued to 
raise funds through bond issuance, mainly for working capit al and to repay their matured debt. 
Household credit growth slowed down slightly to 4.5 percent, largely due to slower growth 
in auto -leasing.  
 In the first quarter of 2020, demand for private sector financing rose, especially among 
businesses affected by the COVID -19 outbreak. Nevertheless, based on the survey in January 
2020, financial institutions were expected to tighten credit underwriting standards in the first

Monetary Policy Report  March 2020                                                                                                                      23 The baht against the U.S. dollar and the nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) index 
depreciated due to the COVID -19 outbreak . 
 The baht against the U.S. dollar  
in the first quarter of 2020 depreciated 
significantly relative to the end of the 
previous quarter (Chart 2.15). At the 
beginning of the quarter, the baht 
depreciation was in line with risk -off 
sentiments caused by concerns over 
the COVID -19 outbreak as th e number 
of infections and deaths continued to 
rise in China. The baht depreciation 
was also driven by better -than-expected  
U.S. economic data outturns and market  
expectations of a policy rate cut ahead of 
the MPC meeting on February 5, 2020. 
Subsequently,  the baht weakened rapidly 
toward the end of the quarter in line with regional currencies after the WHO declared COVID -19 
as a pandemic. Foreign investors in need of U.S. dollar liquidity thus continued to sell off their 
risky assets, including regional an d Thai assets. The MPC’s policy rate cut at the special 
meeting on March 20, 2020 also prompted the baht to weaken somewhat. The baht averaged 
at 31.93 baht to U.S. dollar in March 2020, a 5.4 percent depreciation from an average of 
December 2019.  
 The no minal effective exchange rate (NEER) index averaged at 121.9 in March  
(as of March 24, 2020), a depreciation of 3.8 percent from December 2019. This was 
attributable to the baht depreciation against most trading partner currencies (Chart 2.16). 
Meanwhile,  the preliminary  real effective exchange rate (REER)  in February weakened  
3.3 percent from December 2019. Going forward, exchange rates would likely remain volatile 
due to high uncertainties surrounding the COVID -19 pandemic, monetary policy and additiona l 
economic stimulus measures of major advanced and regional economies, as well as investor 
confidence towards emerging market assets.

Monetary Policy Report  March 2020                                                                                                                      24 The COVID -19 outbreak led to heightened risks to financial system in the short run and 
greater investors’ concerns, resulting in rapid redemption of investment units in some 
mutual funds. Looking ahead, debt servicing ability of households and businesses w ould 
deteriorate, which could restrict decisions of financial institutions to extend loans.  
Should  credit extension slow down considerably, this would in turn affect economic 
activities, resulting in a negative feedback loop.  
 Thailand’s financial stabil ity risks increased in the short term due to the COVID -19 
outbreak. Nevertheless, Thailand’s financial institutions maintained robust financial positions, 
as reflected by adequately high levels of commercial banks’ capital buffers and reserves, 
providing c ushion against risks of deteriorating credit quality. Likewise, external stability 
remained sound, as indicated by high level of international reserves, low external debt to GDP, 
and sustained current account surpluses. This would be adequate to cushion ag ainst the  
U.S. dollar liquidity squeeze in the global financial markets. In addition, Thailand’s public debt 
remained low, providing room for borrowing to finance greater government spending in case 
of emergency. Nevertheless, there remained other risks t hat warranted monitoring:  
 1. Risks in the bond markets increased as some investors rushed to redeem 
their investment units from some mutual funds. In March, foreign asset prices were 
excessively volatile due to the COVID -19 pandemic, affecting net asset v alues (NAVs) of some 
mutual funds in Thailand with majority of investment in foreign debt instruments. Some major 
investors therefore rushed to redeem their investment units from these funds, especially daily 
fixed income funds (Daily FI), which allowed fo r daily redemption and invested in foreign 
assets. As a result, these mutual funds became short of liquidity and had to sell off their 
government bonds prior to their maturities in order to have enough cash to return to 
unitholders. Consequently, prices of  government bonds fell, in turn affecting NAVs of other 
mutual funds and encouraging investors to redeem their investment units from these mutual 
funds. If this problem was not urgently addressed in order to restore financial market stability, 
the problem could exacerbate and pose systemic risks to the functioning of the Thai financial 
markets. In particular, if mutual funds could not generate enough liquidity from selling off 
government bonds, they might be forced to sell off corporate bonds. This would im pact both 
prices and liquidity of corporate bond markets, as well as NAVs of other mutual funds.  
2. Corporate bond default risks increased, which could trigger knock -on effects 
on other related parties in the financial system. Falling corporate income due to impacts 
of the COVID -19 and a sharp fall in oil prices could heighten default risks or rollover risks of 
Thai companies that raised funds through the bond markets. This was as investors have lower 
risk tolerance. In terms of credit rating, most Thai cor porate bonds maturing in 2020 were rated 
A and BBB. The latter group was vulnerable to being downgraded to non -investment grade 
should the issuing companies experience impacts from the economic contraction (Chart 2.17). 
Nevertheless, if corporate bond defa ult risks continued to rise, it would trigger knock -on effects 
to other related parties in the financial system. These included cross -default, especially in the case 
that creditors were commercial banks, and some saving cooperatives with high corporate bon d 
holdings to total assets.  
 In light of the above financial stability risks, the Bank of Thailand continued to 
support liquidity provision in the bond markets through government bond purchase 
program, the policy rate cut, and joint announcement of measures to stabilize the Thai  
 
Monetary Policy Report  March 2020                                                                                                                      25 finan cial markets in collaboration with other related agencies. These were preventive 
measures against systemic risks, including measures to support mutual funds affected  
by liquidity shortage in the financial markets and the establishment of the Corporate Bon d 
Stabilization Fund (BSF) to mitigate rollover risks  in the corporate bond markets  
(Box: Measures to stabilize the Thai financial markets in Chapter 3).   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 3. Weakening ability of households and businesses to manage liquidity and 
service debt amid the economic slowdown would affect credit extension and economic 
activities, resulting in a negative feedback loop.  
 Prior to the spread of COVID -19, 
household debt to GDP ratio in the fourth 
quarter of 2019 rose to 79.5 percent (Chart 
2.18). Meanwhile, the quality of household 
credit was expected  to deteriorate due to 
income shocks, such as the drought, which 
would raise default risk of the household 
sector. The NPL ratio  of consumer loans 
in the fourth quarter of 2019 also increased 
from the previous quarter to 2.9 percent, 
mainly in line  with deteriorating quality of 
mortgage loans and personal loans with 
housing as collateral.

survey in the first three quarters of 2019, showed that agricultural households and households 
with monthly income of less than 30,000 baht were the most vulnerable with high d efault risks. 
This was because these households had higher proportion of negative cash flows relative to 
other groups. Some of these households had financial assets that could only cover their 
expenses for less than 6 months, resulting in limited ability t o cope with income shocks  
(Chart 2.19). This situation also reflected the outlook of household debt in some categories 
that might increase in the period ahead, as some households would face liquidity problems 
and thus need to borrow to cover their spendin g. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Overall financial position of businesses became more vulnerable, especially SMEs. 
This was reflected by the sustained decline of operating profit margin (OPM) and negative 
interest coverage ratio (ICR) of some enterprises.10/ Meanwhile, cre dit quality of business 
loans deteriorated across almost all categories, having extended to include larger enterprises.  
The NPL ratio of SME loans remained high at 4.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2019.11/  
 Looking ahead, the spread of COVID -19 could cause a severe impact on the revenue 
of some businesses, especially those related to tourism, transportation and some segments

assist borrowers affected by the economic conditions. This was expected to help relieve the 
impact to a certain level (Box:  Credit assistance measures to support borrowers in Chapter 3).  
 4. Oversupply in the real estate market would increase due to weaker demand 
for residences from domestic and foreign buyers.  
In January 2020, the Bank of Thailand relaxed the loan -to-value (LTV) measure in 
order to facilitate home ownership. The relaxed c onditions included, first, for the first mortgage 
contract of residential units with value  under 10 million baht, homebuyers would be allowed to 
borrow an extra 10 percent above the collateral value to cover necessary moving expenses. 
Second, for the secon d mortgage contract, homebuyers would be subject to 90 -percent  
LTV ratio provided that the first contract had been serviced for at least two years, and  
80-percent LTV ratio if the first contract had been serviced for less than two years (from three 
years  in the previous regulation).12/  
Going forward, the real estate market would experience greater risks due to substantial 
oversupply. At the end of 2019, unsold units of low -rise residences and condominiums 
increased from 2018 by 5.9 and 14.6 percent respec tively. This corresponded to the longer 
time-to-go from 45 to 49 months for low -rise residences, and from 18 to 22 months for 
condominiums. This occurred as developers continued to launch new projects despite 
weakening demand, particularly small - and mediu m-sized developers that were not listed in 
the stock exchange and able to adjust themselves slower than large, listed developers.

residential demand from domestic and foreign buyers continued to weaken from the previous 
year. However, the impact of falling foreign demand was expected to be limited because 
foreign buyers accounted for only 10 percent of total ownership transfers, or 16 percent of the 
total value of condominium transfers in 2019 (Chart 2.21).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.2 Outlook for the Thai Economy  
The Thai economy would contract significantly, expanding at a much lower rate than the 
assessment in the previous Monetary Policy Report . Headline inflation  would be negative 
in line with energy prices.  
The Thai economy would contract significantly, expanding at a much lower rate 
than the assessment in the previous Monetary Policy Report.  The Thai economy was 
expected to contract 5.3 percent in 2020 but would recover and expand 3.0 percent  
in 2021, despite at a level below its potential throughout the forecast horizon.   
The spread of COVID -19, which was declared as a pandemic, would have a severe impact on 
Thailand’s trading partner economies, causing some economies to enter into recession.  
The spread of COVID -19 also caused supply chain disruptions in several countries, affecting 
the Thai economy through multiple channels. In particular,  tourism and merchandise exports 
were severely affected. As a result, some businesses and households that relied on foreign 
sources of income received lower revenue and faced liquidity problems. Business and 
consumer confidence also fell to the lowest leve ls in many years, triggering knock -on effects 
on domestic economic activities, both consumption and investment. Moreover, farm income 
would still be depressed by the drought, while public expenditure would experience a larger 
impact than previously assesse d due to the delayed enactment of the Annual Budget 
Expenditure Act B.E. 2563 (A.D. 2020).

  Nevertheless, the government’s implemented measures13/ would be the key 
mechanism in alleviating the impact on the economy, by providing support to vulnerable 
busin esses and households to some extent. However, the measures would be unable to offset 
a significant contraction in aggregate demand. The Thai economy would therefore contract 
substantially in 2020, which was the first contraction since 2009. Moreover, the C ommittee 
assessed that the tourism sector would take some time to begin to recover, and would not 
return to its previous growth path in the following periods.  
 Additional assumptions underlying the economic projection in this Report  
include (1) the COVID -19 outbreak in Thailand would be contained within the second quarter 
of 2020 according to the Ministry of Public Health estimate, and (2) the projection took into 
account measures implemented before March 25, 2020, not including any measures thereafter.   
 Headline inflation would be negative due to the sharp decline in energy prices 
in line with crude oil price assumptions. Headline inflation was projected to be negative 
at -1.0 percent in 2020, before gradually increasing to 0.3 percent in 2021 consistent  with 
the gradual economic recovery outlook. However, headline inflation would remain below the 
inflation target.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Summary of the key forecast assumptions  
 Trading partner economies  were projected to slow down significantly in 2020 as several 
economies would enter into recession due to the COVID -19 outbreak. However, trading 
partner economies would expand in 2021, partly owing to the very -low-base effect, benefits 
from financial and fiscal measures in many countries, and improving COVID -19 situation.  
 The federal funds rate was cut twice in March 2020 to 0.00 -0.25 percent to support the 
economy and the financial system that were severely affected by the COVID -19 outbreak. 
The federal funds rate was projected to remain at this level throug hout the forecast horizon.  
 Regional currencies (excluding the Chinese yuan) depreciated throughout the forecast 
horizon. This was because regional economies were affected by the COVID -19 outbreak 
before other regions, which led to deterioration of investo r confidence in holding regional 
securities. This resulted in capital outflows from regional stock markets, although the situation  
would start to improve in 2021.

  Dubai crude oil prices were revised down substantially throughout the forecast horizon due 
to both the decline in global demand as a result of the COVID -19 outbreak and the decision 
of Saudi Arabia, which was the largest oil producer, to lower crude oil prices. This was 
followin g the failure of the OPEC and Russia to agree on the crude oil production cut, 
causing crude oil prices to sink to the lowest level in 17 years.  
 Farm income, excluding government support measure, was revised down in 2020 in line with 
the decline in agricu ltural output, especially off -season rice and sugarcane, mainly caused 
by a larger -than-expected impact of the drought in the first half of the year. Meanwhile, 
agriculture prices were expected to rise, especially prices of palm oil, glutinous rice and 
sugarcane. In addition, farm income in 2021 was expected to increase due to the lower 
base of agricultural output in 2020 and better assumptions on the weather and dam water 
levels than in 2020.  
 Public spending at current prices , both public consumption and i nvestment,  was lower than 
previously assessed on account of a larger -than-expected impact of the delayed enactment 
of the Annual Budget Expenditure Act B.E. 2563 (A.D. 2020), the change in the structure 
of the annual budget expenditure for fiscal year 2021 , as well as a smaller investment 
budget and a prolonged delay of some state -owned enterprise (SOE) investment.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Merchandise exports would decline markedly in the short term due to the significant global 
economic slowdown.  
The value of merchandise exports was expected to markedly shrink both in 
terms of volume and prices. Global trade volume would contract in response to global 
economic conditions, as several countries would enter into recession as a result of the  
COVID -19 outbreak. Moreover, Thai merchandise exports would be additionally affected by 
supply chain disruptions, as well as lower demand from oil -exporting countries on account of 
the substantial fall in crude oil prices. Nonetheless, exports of some products woul d benefit 
from rising external demand, despite being unable to offset overall contraction in merchandise 
exports. In particular, the benefit would be seen in necessities such as rice and canned fish, 
and medical equipment such as rubber gloves and cassava,  which was a raw material for 
alcohol production. Meanwhile, prices of merchandise exports would significantly decline in

prices, such as petroleum  products, and petrochemical and chemical products, would be 
significantly lower than previously assessed. Nonetheless, the value of merchandise exports 
was projected to expand slightly in 2021, on account of the gradual recovery of the global 
economy and g lobal trade volume once the spread of COVID -19 subsided. The Committee 
assessed that the value of merchandise exports would contract 8.8 percent in 2020, 
before expanding slightly at 0.2 percent in 2021.  
Exports of services were expected to severely contra ct in the short run due to the   
COVID -19 outbreak  
Exports of services would severely contract  as the COVID -19 outbreak led to travel 
restrictions, including flight suspension and border closure in several countries. Many airlines 
then had to temporarily s uspend flight services, resulting in decline in foreign tourist figures of 
all nationalities (Chart 2.22). In addition, the significant economic slowdown in several 
countries due to the COVID -19 outbreak led to declines, not only in foreign tourist figures , but 
also in tourist spending per head. However, foreign tourist figures were expected to gradually 
increase in the second half of 2020, based on the assumption that the spread of COVID -19 
would be contained within the second quarter of 2020. Nevertheless , tourists would start to 
travel once the vaccines for the coronavirus were to be widely distributed. The foreign tourist 
figures were projected to be 15.0 and 20.0 million persons in 2020 and 2021, respectively.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The current account balance was p rojected to record a surplus of 19.4 and 19.2 
billion U.S. dollars in 2020 and 2021, respectively. The services balance was revised from 
being in surplus to deficit, as tourist receipts declined considerably in line with the decline in 
the number of touris ts and spending per head. Meanwhile, the trade balance was expected to 
register a larger surplus due to a substantial contraction in imports value. Import volume 
contracted in line with imports of raw materials and intermediate goods for export -related 
manufacturing, and capital goods for domestic investment. Meanwhile, import prices declined 
in tandem with global crude oil prices.

but would expand in the subsequent per iod in line with the gradual recovery in tourism 
and merchandise exports.  
Private consumption was expected to contract in 2020, which would be the first 
contraction since 2009. The COVID -19 outbreak led to severe contraction of tourism sector. 
In addition,  suspension of a wide range of economic activities and the enactment of the 
emergency decree from March 26, 2020, affected consumption in the services and away -from-
home spending categories. Meanwhile, non -farm income decreased substantially because the 
manufacturing sectors were affected by the sharp decline in both domestic and external 
demand. Moreover, farm income was expected to decline due to a more -severe -than-
expected impact of the drought, reducing capacity of the agricultural sector to absorb 
unem ployed workers moving from manufacturing and services sectors. However, government 
measures to alleviate the impact of the COVID -19 outbreak would partly help relieve the 
impact on private consumption to a certain level. These included measures on credit, 
transfers, expenses reduction, and taxes.14/ In the period ahead, private consumption was 
projected to gradually edge up in line with the recovery of tourism and merchandise exports 
once the spread of COVID -19 could be contained. However, the slow recovery of household 
income and the elevated household debt would continue to weigh on private consumption in 
the period ahead.  
Private investment  was projected to contract in the short term in line with both domestic 
and external demand.  
 Private investment was projected to contract in 2020 in line with both domestic and 
external demand due to the COVID -19 outbreak. This led profitability of businesses and 
investment confidence to deteriorate markedly. However, private investment was expect ed to 
improve in 2021 thanks to a gradual recovery in merchandise exports, the PPP projects in 
infrastructure investment projects that had been postponed from previous periods, as well as 
a greater clarity pertaining to investment in the 5G network followi ng the auction in the first 
quarter of 2020.  
Public expenditure would be a key driver of economic growth  
 Public expenditure, both consumption and investment, was expected to expand 
and would be a key driver of the Thai economy. Following the enactment of  the Annual 
Budget Expenditure Act B.E. 2563 (A.D. 2020), although government agencies adjusted the 
procurement process for a faster disbursement, this could not offset a larger -than-expected 
impact of the delayed enactment of the Annual Budget Expenditure  Act in the previous period. 
SOE investment was revised down in line with project postponement and a lower budget for 
capital expenditure on transportation projects. This included, for example, the Bangkok -
Nakhon Ratchasima high -speed rail project, whose e nvironmental impact assessment (EIA) 
report was being revised. Meanwhile, the first and second packages of government 
measures to mitigate the impact of the COVID -19 outbreak, totaling 464 billion baht or 
2.8 percent of GDP (excluding tax relief measures w orth approximately 260 billion baht 
or 1.5 percent of GDP) , were mostly measures on credit and transfers. This was expected

and investment (Box: Government relief measures to alleviate the impact of COVID -19 in 
Chapter 2) . In sum, public investment would expand at a lower rate than previously 
assessed in the previous Monetary Policy Report, while public consumption growth 
would remain largely unchanged.  Going forwar d, factors that would affect public expenditure  
included changes in the structure of the annual budget expenditure for the fiscal year 2021, 
resulting in changes in budget allocations for current and capital expenditures, and a lower 
budget expenditure in the period ahead as revenue collection was expected to be lower than 
previously assessed.  
Projection of headline inflation would be negative in the short term in line with declines in 
energy prices and core inflation.  
 Projection of headline inflation in 2020 would be negative at -1.0 percent, which 
would be lower than the inflation target and significantly below the forecast in the 
previous Monetary Policy Report.  The downward revision was consistent with a sharp 
decline in crude oil prices in early 2020,  which led to a large fall in energy prices. Meanwhile,  
core inflation was expected to be negative on the back of a large decrease in demand -pull 
inflationary pressures. In addition, measures to reduce living expenses were expected to partly 
prevent prices from rising. Nonetheless, headline inflation was projec ted to gradually 
increase to 0.3 percent in 2021 in line with the assumption of a gradual rise of crude oil 
prices. Core inflation was expected to edge up slightly from -0.1 percent in 2020 to 0.1 
percent in 2021, consistent with the economic recovery outl ook. However, headline inflation 
would remain below the inflation target throughout the forecast horizon.  
Economic and inflation projections were subject to greater downside risks and were  
highly uncertain.  
The Committee assessed that economic and inflati on projections were highly 
uncertain and mainly depended on the situation of the COVID -19 spread and the 
success of the containment measures. Downside risks to the Thai economy increased 
significantly from the assessment in the previous Monetary Policy Rep ort (Chart 2.23). 
The possibilities that the Thai economy would underperform the baseline projection 
would be due to the following factors.  First, the global economy could enter into a deep 
recession should the outbreak become more severe and prolonged tha n expected, exerting 
additional adverse impacts on Thailand’s merchandise exports. Second, global financial 
stability risks might affect the Thai economy in the medium term. Third, Thailand’s tourism 
might not recover in the second half of 2020 if the outb reak in Thailand and other countries 
prolonged and could not be contained by the second quarter of 2020. Fourth, risk of a wider 
spread of COVID -19 in Thailand might force the government to implement stricter measures 
to control the outbreak. As a result, this might cause some businesses to permanently shut 
down operations or significantly reduce employment, thereby impacting household income. 
Fifth, more -severe -than-expected impact of the drought could affect farm income and reduce 
the capacity of agricult ural sector to absorb workers moving from other sectors. However, 
there were possibilities that the Thai economy would outperform the baseline projection  
due to (1) a faster -than-expected development of vaccines and medicines for the COVID -19, 
(2) better -than-expected impacts of additional government’s stimulus measures to alleviate 
the impact and support domestic consumption and investment, as well as measures to assist

infrastructure investment and PPP projects, which might incentivize the private sector to invest 
more and faster. Moreover, there remained downside risks to headline and core inflation 
projections in line with risks to crude oil prices and the economi c growth projection (Charts

Monetary Policy Report  March 2020                                                                                                                      37 3. Monetary Policy Decision  
The MPC cut the policy rate 2 times to 0.75 percent in order to alleviate the negative impacts,  
particularly from the COVID -19 pandemic which resulted in severe impacts on the economy  
and financial stability.  
At the meeting on February 5, 2020, the Committee voted unanimously to cut the 
policy rate  by 0.25 percentage point from 1.25 to 1.00 percent. The Committee assessed 
that the Thai economy would expand at a much lower rate than the previous forecast and 
much further below its potential due to the COVID -19 outbreak, the delayed Annual Budget 
Expe nditure Act, and the drought. Headline inflation was projected to be below the lower 
bound of the inflation target throughout the forecast horizon. Financial stability became more 
vulnerable due to the prospect of  an economic slowdown. In this situation, there was an urgent 
need to coordinate financial and fiscal measures. The Committee viewed that a more 
accommodative  monetary policy stance would alleviate the negative impacts. Monetary 
accommodation would also suppor t liquidity provision and debt restructuring for businesses 
and households severely affected from the economic slowdown, both of which should be 
urgently implemented and materialized.  
Later on, the COVID -19 outbreak became more severe and widespread rapid ly and 
continuously. This raised concerns among global financial markets, affecting the liquidity of 
the Thai financial markets during the week prior to the scheduled meeting at the end of March. 
The Committee thus held the special meeting on March 20, 202 0 and viewed that amid 
the rapid changes in the outbreak situation, prompt policy action prior to the scheduled 
meeting would help alleviate the impacts on the Thai economy and financial markets in 
a timely manner. The Committee thus voted unanimously to c ut the policy rate by 0.25 
percentage point from 1.00 to 0.75 percent, effective on March 23, 2020. Nonetheless, the 
Committee viewed that the COVID -19 outbreak in the period ahead would be more severe 
than previously expected. Also, the situation would ta ke some time before returning to normal, 
which would severely affect the Thai economy. Therefore, the policy rate cut would reduce 
interest burdens of affected borrowers, alleviate liquidity strain in the financial markets, 
mitigate the impacts on the econ omy, and would also reinforce fiscal measures already 
implemented and forthcoming.  
At the meeting on March 25, 2020, the Committee voted 4 to 2 to maintain the 
policy rate at 0.75 percent. Two members voted to cut the policy rate by 0.25 percentage 
point,  while one MPC member did not vote.15/ The Committee viewed that the economic 
and inflation outlook remained consistent with the assessment at the special meeting. The Thai 
economy would markedly contract in 2020 due mainly to the COVID -19 outbreak. Headlin e 
inflation in 2020 would be negative. Financial system would be more vulnerable driven by 
contracting economy. Nevertheless, the Committee viewed that the policy rate cut at the 
previous special meeting, as well as the implemented measures to promote stab ility in the Thai 
financial markets, helped ease financial conditions. Commercial banks’ lending rates gradually 
decreased and stability of domestic financial markets, especially the bond market, improved. 
                                            
15   The MPC member attended the meeting through video conference to consider the economic outlook, financial 
stability, and the appropriate monetary policy formulation but did not vote.   
 
Monetary Policy Report  March 2020                                                                                                                      38 Most members would wait to assess the adjustments in the financial markets as well as 
additional reduction in interest rates by financial institutions. Most members deemed it 
appropriate to preserve policy space to cushion against high uncertainties in the future. 
Meanwhile, all members viewed that the go vernment’s announced relief measures and loan 
repayment measures to assist borrowers affected by the COVID -19 were more targeted in 
addressing the problems. However, two members voted to cut the policy rate by 0.25 
percentage point as the extra accommodati ve monetary policy would, in their views, be 
commensurate with the significant economic contraction.  
In determining the appropriate course of monetary policy, details on the key assessment 
are as follows.  
The Thai economy faced negative risk factors whic h remained highly uncertain and could 
severely affect the economy and financial stability . 
The Committee viewed that The Thai economy faced several negative risk factors 
that occurred in a similar period, including the COVID -19 outbreak, the delay in the 
government’s annual budget spending, and the drought. Such negative risk factors were highly 
uncertain and could result in a more severe and much broader impact than expected.  
The Committee thus assessed t he situation through scenario analysis . In the worse scenario 
that negative risk factors coincided, there were possibilities that income of businesses and 
households would severely decrease, and debt servicing ability would deteriorate. Financial 
instituti ons would also experience higher NPLs and lower capital funds, causing financial 
institutions to be more cautious in extending loans. This led to difficulty in accessing funds and 
lower liquidity of the private sector, resulting in a negative feedback loop  in the economic system .  
In addition, some pockets of risks to financial stability could become contagious 
if not urgently addressed. Such risks included, for example, a reduction of business revenue 
that could increase default risks of debt -financing cor porates or rollover risks. This could 
potentially trigger a cross default and if investor confidence declined, rollover risks could spill 
over to other corporate bonds. The Committee thus deemed it necessary to monitor risks and 
vulnerabilities closely and  urged the BOT to prepare policy tools to be readily employed to 
maintain financial system stability given various situations. The Committee also supported the 
close coordination between the BOT and other related regulatory agencies to stand ready to 
preve nt systemic risks in a pre -emptive manner.  
In the short term, financial and fiscal measures should be coordinated to reduce risks to 
the economy and financial stability, addressing the problems proactively and targeted to 
prevent the contagion.  
  Thai go vernment agencies coordinated both financial and fiscal measures to relieve 
the impacts and reduce the abovementioned risks, addressing problems in the following directions.     
 1. Policy conduct must be forward looking and pre -emptive, without having to 
wait for adverse impacts to be observed. For instance, during the first phase when most of 
the COVID -19 patients were contained in China and not widespread to other countries around 
the world, the Committee assessed that the spread of the COVID -19 had already affected the 
Thai economy, despite be ing highly uncertain whether there would be additional and a more 
severe impact. The Committee thus voted to cut the policy rate on February 5, 2020. Later on,  
 
Monetary Policy Report  March 2020                                                                                                                      39 as the spread situation would likely be more severe with liquidity shortages in the Thai bond 
market, the Committee then held the special meeting on March 20, 2020 and cut the policy 
rate once again. In addition, the Committee encouraged the BOT to relax regulations so that 
financial institutions could proactively assist borrowers, including liquidit y provision and debt 
restructuring , (Box: Credit assistance measures to support borrowers  in Chapter 3 ) in order 
to prevent the impact of negative feedback loop on the Thai economy.  
2. Measures must be targeted aiming to alleviate the impacts to businesses  and 
the general public by coordinating both financial and fiscal measures. For instance, the BOT 
coordinated with financial institutions and other financial service providers to implement credit 
measures to assist borrowers affected by the COVID -19, issui ng minimum measures to 
temporarily pause loan payment. Meanwhile, the government launched credit measures, cash 
transfer and expense reduction measures, as well as tax relief measures. (Box: Government 
relief measures to alleviate the impact of COVID -19 in Chapter 2 ). These measures were 
targeted to those experienced a direct impact.  
3 . Measures should aim at preventing the contagion, while ensuring the well -
functioning of the financial system. For instance, the BOT ensured sufficient liquidity in the 
bond market through continuous government bond purchases, which helped reduce volatilities 
of government bond yields and prevent knock -on effects on other interest rates in the money 
markets. Nevert heless, on March 22, 2020, BOT and related agencies issued measures to 
support mutual funds affected by liquidity shortage in the financial markets and established 
the Corporate Bond Liquidity Stabilization Fund (BSF) to build confidence and reduce rollove r 
risks in the bond market. (Box:  Measures to stabilize the Thai financial markets  in Chapter 3 ). 
Moreover, the Committee supported the increasing role of mechanisms to help reduce risks 
of NPLs. These mechanisms included, such as, the Thai Credit Guarantee Corporation that 
provided credit guarantee, and the Asset Management Company (AMC) that helped p urchase 
non-performing assets out of financial institutions’ balance sheet for future management.  
The key challenge for the Thai economy and financial system was the distribution of 
liquidity in the financial system, which was ample at the macro level, to  businesses and 
households .  
The Committee viewed that the current challenges for the Thai economy and financial 
system were different from those during the financial crisis in 1997. At present, Thailand had 
a high level of international reserves, while fi nancial institutions were sound with a high level 
of capital funds. Liquidity in the financial system remained adequate at the macro level.  
The key challenge was to urgently provide liquidity and credit supports to affected businesses 
and households. In p articular, measures that allowed for debt moratorium, reduced loan 
installments, and extended debt repayment would help alleviate the immediate impacts. For 
the next step, debt restructuring must be urgently and constantly implemented in parallel with 
distribution of liquidity, which was ample at the macro level, to businesses and households in 
need. Examples of such measures could include provision of soft loans for businesses and 
households with the potential to repay their loans together with credit guar antees, so that loans 
could be allocated to SMEs more efficiently. Such measures could help those affected to get 
through this period.  
  
 
Monetary Policy Report  March 2020                                                                                                                      40 In the long run, some pockets of risks in the financial system amid the lower -for-longer 
interest rate environment, as w ell as the stability of foreign exchange markets, must still 
be monitored . 
The Committee assessed that concerns over the COVID -19 led investors to reduce 
their holdings of risky assets in the short run, as reflected by subdued activities in the real 
estate  and stock markets. However, in the long run, as investors’ concerns subsided,  
the search -for-yield behavior that could lead to underpricing of risks must be monitored.  
This behavior could become more severe in the lower -for-longer interest rate environm ent.  
In addition, although the baht depreciated to some extent, the Committee viewed that in the 
period ahead as the spread of the COVID -19 would subside, the baht would still face upward 
pressures from current account surplus which was expected to remain  persistent.  
The Committee, therefore, supported the BOT to continue to relax regulations to promote 
capital flow balance. On February 28, 2020, the Ministry of Finance and the BOT agreed to 
increase the threshold for export proceeds that did not need to be repatriated from below 
200,000 to 1 million U.S. dollars per bill of lading.16/  
The Committee would stand ready to use additional policy tools in an appropriate and 
timely manner. Such tools included the policy rate and other financial measures.  
Looking ahead, the Committee would monitor developments of economic growth, 
inflation, and financial stability, together with associated risks, especially the impact of the 
COVID -19 outbreak, in deliberating monetary policy going forward. The Committee wou ld 
stand ready to use additional policy tools in an appropriate and timely manner. Such tools 
included the policy rate and other monetary measures that would help enhance the policy rate 
transmission as well as loan extension by financial institutions to r each the target groups.

providers to assist  borrowers affected by the COVID -19.  
In recent periods, the Thai economy has been continuously affected by negative risk 
factors, including trade tensions, the drought, as well as increasingly severe COVID -19 
outbreak. On February 28, 2020, the BOT, in collaboration with financial institution s, issued 
proactive measures to assist borrowers of all types of business loans and households affected 
by the outbreak. These measures will be effective for a period of 2 years between January  
1, 2020 to December 31, 2021 and aim at supporting liquidity provision and accelerating debt 
restructuring process. Examples include provision of additional working capital, a loan 
repayment holiday, an extension of loan repayment period, interest and fee reduction,  minimum 
repayment reduction for credit card loans to below 10 percent, and a temporary increase in 
the credit limit of personal loans.  
The BOT has been coordinating closely with financial institutions and other financial 
service providers and agreed that the impact of the COVID -19 would become more sever e 
and widespread. Thus, all parties deemed it urgent to adopt a set of minimum measures to 
support retail and SME borrowers with the potential to repay their loans and whose loans are 
not past due for longer than 90 days (NPL). Such measures will become ef fective from the 
debt repayment period of April 1, 2020 onwards. Details are summarized as in Chart 1, where 
each financial service provider could offer relief packages that are better than the minimum 
measures.  
The BOT relaxed regulations to further enco urage financial institutions to provide liquidity to 
affected borrowers.  
The BOT temporarily relaxed liquidity -related regulations17  in order to reduce credit 
costs of financial institutions that increased from liquidity provision and debt restructuring f or 
affected borrowers. This would enable financial institutions to assist borrowers more extensively  
and faster. Details of relaxed regulations are as follows.  
(1) Pre -emptive debt restructuring  for borrowers with signs of debt repayment problems 
but are not yet classified as NPL. Debt restructuring for these borrowers will not be classified 
as trouble debt restructuring (TDR), thus not affecting borrowers’ credit history. This will remain   
a permanent measure.  
(2) Classification of borrowers entitled to the relief measures:  
(2.1) Borrowers under pre -emptive debt restructuring can be immediately classified 
as normal borrowers.  
(2.2) NPL borrowers, who can make repayments in accordance with the debt 
restructuring agreement for 3 consecutive months, can be classified as normal borrowers 
(from previously having to make repayment for 12 consecutive months).  
(2.3) Borrowers obtaining additional working capital can be immediately classified 
as normal borro wers.  
(3) Provision not required for credit lines of borrowers that are not yet activated.

Monetary Policy Report  March 2020                                                                                                                      43  (4) Period for holding non -performing assets (NPA) obtained from debt restructuring 
for financial institutions was extended to 10 years (from previously 5 year s).   
(5) Relationship managers (RM) can provide assistance regarding debt restructuring 
to their clients with prudent internal controls.   
(6) Financial institutions must report credit conditions and progress in assisting these 
borrowers to the BOT  on a m onthly basis so that the BOT can  continuously monitor the 
situation.    
Related government agencies launched measures to support debt restructuring and additional 
credit provision  
 (1) Tax relief measures: exemption from personal and corporate income taxe s for 
borrowers’ income earned from forgiven debt; exemption from income tax, value added tax 
(VAT), and specific business tax (SBT), stamp duties for both borrowers and creditors imposed 
on income earned from transfer of assets, sales of goods or provisio n of services, and any 
instrument executed in relation to debt restructuring, as well as reduction of fees for registration  
and transfer of property from 2 to 0.01 percent.   
 (2) Financial statements of financial institutions on classification and provision: Auditors  
shall provide opinion without bias in compliance with relevant accounting and supervisory 
standards of the BOT.  
 (3) The Thai Credit Guarantee Corporation (TCG) launched additional credit guarantee  
facilities, including “The Funding Thai SMEs for Thailand” program with a guaranteed amount 
of 60 billion baht, and the 8th phase of Portfolio Guarantee Scheme (PGS8) with a guaranteed 
amount of 50 billion baht. These will somewhat help reduce credit cost s of financial institutions. 
In addition, TCG will extend the maturity of credit guarantee period for SMEs already under 
PGS5 – PGS7 for another five years in order to facilitate debt restructuring. There will also be 
an adjustment in claiming procedures t hat can be done without borrowers having to enter into 
a litigation, and an expansion in guarantee coverage.  
These measures will only be successful if financial institutions and other financial service 
providers play an active role, while more borrowers co operate in accelerating debt restructuring.    
The BOT, financial institutions, and other financial service providers aim to ease 
interest burdens of those affected by the outbreak in order to enhance their liquidity by urgently 
implementing minimum measure s and additional debt restructuring measures to have a 
noticeable impact. The BOT has relaxed regulations to reduce credit costs of financial 
institutions arising from proactive measures to support borrowers. Such credit assistance 
measures for borrowers w ill reinforce financial and fiscal measures gradually implemented 
previously in order to reduce funding costs for financial institutions. Such measures include, 
for instance, a more accommodative monetary policy by cutting the policy rate to a historically  
low level, and soft loan worth 1.5 trillion baht funded by the Government Saving Bank. 
However, these support measures for borrowers will only be successful if financial institutions 
and other financial service providers play an active role, while more bo rrowers cooperate in 
accelerating debt restructuring. The BOT will continue to monitor and push forward measures 
to assist borrowers so that borrowers affected by the outbreak would be able to pass through 
this difficult time.

In March 2020, the situation on the COVID -19 spread intensified and raised concerns 
among global financial markets. Asset prices were highly volatile. Investors in many countries 
thus continuously sold off their assets,  resulting in tightening global liquidity. This led to 
irregular functioning of global financial markets and subsequently affected the Thai financial 
markets, especially liquidity in the bond market. This was driven by sell -off by foreign investors 
and som e mutual funds following a fast redemption of investment units of some investors. This 
resulted in liquidity shortages of those mutual funds, forcing them to liquidate their bonds 
before maturities at lower than fair value prices. Most of these bonds were high-quality bond 
including government and investment -grade corporate bonds. In this situation, investment  
unit holders in other mutual funds thus received lower returns than they should. This could 
result in accelerated redemption of investment units in other mutual funds, consequently 
disrupting the functioning of mutual funds and the Thai bond markets.  
The Bank of Thailand (BOT) addressed the liquidity situation  to support the  
well-functioning of the bond market. The BOT purchased government bonds amou nting more 
than 100 billion baht during March 13 -20, 2020, and reduced and cancelled parts of the BOT 
bond issuances in order to increase liquidity in the government bond market. In addition,  
the BOT, the Ministry of Finance, and the Securities and Exchan ge Commission (SEC) 
have been closely monitoring the situation and deemed it necessary to implement 
additional measures to stabilize the Thai financial markets on March 22, 2020.  These 
measures would stop the liquidity problem in the financial markets from  spreading further. The 
three measures are summarized as follows.18/  
  1. Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (MFLF)  The BOT will provide liquidity through the 
repurchase  agreement or repo transactions charging a special rate based on the policy rate 
minus 0.5 percent for financial institutions providing liquidity support for money market funds 
(MMFs) and daily fixed income funds (Daily FI). On March 24, 2020,  the BOT extended  
the scope of this liquidity facility to cover all MMFs and Daily FI funds. Later on March 30, 
2020,  the BOT further extended the scope of the facility in order to increase flexibility and 
efficiency by allowing more types of assets to be used as coll ateral in repo transactions with 
the BOT for the liquidity support.  
2. Corporate Bond Liquidity Stabilization Fund (BSF) was under consideration for this 
Fund to be urgently established. The Fund’s objective is to provide bridge financing to 
purchase bonds issued by high -quality firms maturing during 2020 -2021. Nevertheless, firms 
requesting for liquidity support from the BS F will be charged a higher interest rate than market 
rates. These firms should have raised the majority of their funding needs through other means, 
such as commercial bank loans or capital increase, have a clear long -term financing plan, and 
meet other con ditions as set out by the BSF’s investment committee. In addition, if the issuers 
simultaneously offer secured bonds to the general public, the bonds that the BSF will invest 
in must also be secured with collaterals no inferior than those pledged on the bo nds sold to 
the general public.  
                                            
18/ Joint Statement on the Measures to Stabilize the Financial Markets  (March 22, 2020 )  
 
Monetary Policy Report  March 2020                                                                                                                      45  3. The BOT stands ready to continue its liquidity provision in the bond market through 
government bond purchases and consider additional measures in order to enable a n efficient 
functioning of the  Thai financial  markets. This would ensure sufficient liquidity to provide a 
funding channel for the economic system and preserve financial stability of the country as a whole.    
Measures to stabilize the Thai financial markets abovementioned will help enhance 
liquidity in the financial markets, ensure the normal functioning of the bond markets amid 
turbulences in the global financial markets, and restore confidence of both Thai and foreign 
investors in the bond market. All related agencies, both in the public and private  sectors, will 
be closely monitoring developments in the financial markets and stand ready to coordinate in 
implementing additional measures. This would ensure that the Thai financial markets will 
continue to function normally and efficiently.

The Thai economy in the fourth quarter of 2019 expanded at a slower pace due to both 
domestic  and external demand. The delayed enactment of the Annual Budget Expenditure 
Act B.E. 2563 (A.D. 2020) had a larger -than-expected impact on public expenditure. The Thai 
economy in the first quarter of 2020 was projected to contract, mainly as tourism and 
merchandise exports were severely affected by escalating COVID -19 outbreak situation.

Headline inflation in January -February increased due to the base effect of energy prices, but 
was projected to decline in March in line with global crude oil prices. Core inflation increased 
in tandem with prices of seasonings and condiments. Short -term inflation expectations 
declined slightly while long -term inflation expectations remain largely unchanged.

Short -term government bond yields and commercial banks’ interest rates fell in line with the 
policy rate. Long -term government bond yields declined in tandem with U.S. treasury yields, 
before rising rapidly towards the end of the quar ter on the back of  concerns over the  
COVID -19 situation.  Business credits expanded as a result of corporate bond issuance.  
The baht against the U.S. dollar depreciated due to the COVID -   and the Committee’s policy 
rate cut at the special meeting.

The price -to-earning (P/E) ratio of the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) and the Market for 
Alternative Investment (mai) decreased in tandem with stock market indices worldwide.  
The share of unrated bond issuance remained stable.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Stability: household sector  
The ratio of household debt to GDP in the fourth quarter of 2019 remained high and increased 
slightly from the previous quarter. Credit quality of households was expected to deteriorate as 
in response to income shocks, where the NPL ratio of households increased from the previous 
quarter mainly in line with deteriorating quality of mortgage loans and personal loans with 
housing as collateral.

Overall vulnerabilities in the corporate sector increased, especially for SMEs, as reflected by 
the sustained decline of operating profit margin (OPM) and negative interest coverage ratio 
(ICR) of some businesses. Credit quality of business  loans deteriorated across almost all 
categories, having extended to include larger enterprises. The NPL ratio of SME loans in the 
fourth quarter of 2019 remained high at 4.6 percent.

Oversupply in the real  estate market increased, corresponded to the longer time -to-go caused 
by (1) weaker demand for residences from domestic and foreign buyers as evident from 
declining ownership transfers, and (2) new residential project launches despite weakening 
demand. Th e impact of the relaxed loan -to-value (LTV) measure announced in early 2020 
would need to be monitored going forward.

Financial institutions maintained robust financial positions, as reflected by adequately high 
levels of commercial banks’ capital buffers to cushion against risks of credit quality 
deterioration. In the fourth quarter of 2019, commercial bank credits expanded at a slower 
pace in line with economic conditions. Overall NPL ratio remai ned largely unchanged from the 
previous quarter.
