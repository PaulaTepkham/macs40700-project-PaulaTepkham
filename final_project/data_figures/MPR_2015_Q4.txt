Monetary Policy Report  December  2015 
Monetary Policy in Thailand  
The Monetary Policy Committee  
Under the Bank of Thailand Act, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) comprise s the 
Governor and two deputy Governors, as well as four distinguished external members  
representing various sectors of the country, with the aim of ensuring  that monetary policy 
decisions are effective and transparent.  
The Monetary Policy Objective  
The MPC sets monetary policy to promote  the objective of supporting sustainable a nd full 
potential economic growth, without causing inflationary problems or economic and financial 
imbalances or bubbles.  
The Monetary Policy Target  
The Cabinet  approved the annual average headline inflation target of 2.5 + 1.5 percent as the 
monetary policy target for 2015, in place of the quarterly average core inflation target of 0.5 – 3.0 
percent . The new inflation target  was jointly proposed by the MPC and the Minister of 
Finance. In the event that headline inflation de viates from the target, the MPC shall explain 
the reasons behind the target breach  to the public, together with measures taken and 
estimated time  to bring inflation back to the target.  
The Monetary Policy Instrument  
The MPC utilizes the 1 -day bilateral repurchase transaction rate as the policy interest rate to 
signal the monetary policy stance.  
Evaluati on of Economic Conditions and Forecasts  
The Bank of Thailand takes into account  information from all sources, the ma croeconomic 
model, data from each economic sector, as well as surveys  of large enterprises , together with  
small and medium -sized  enterprises from all over the country,  and various financial institutions  
to ensure that economic evaluations and forecasts are accurate and cover all aspects, both at 
the macro and micro levels.   
Monetary Policy Communication  
Recognizing the importance of monetary policy communication to the public, the MPC 
employs  various  channel s of communication, both in Thai and English, such as (1) organizing 
a press statement at 14.00 on the day of the Committee meeting, (2) publishing edited 
minutes of the MPC meeting two weeks after the meeting, and (3) publishing the Monetary 
Policy Report  every quarter.  Monetary Policy Report  December  2015

and Monetary PolicyMonetary Policy Report  December 2015                                                         1 1. Growth and Inflation Prospects  
and Monetary Policy   
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 The Thai economy in 2015 is projected to expand by slightly faster  than 
the previous assessment on the back of higher -than-expected  growth in public 
investment and private consumption, which offset the weaker -than-expected 
exports and private investment in 2015 Q3. For 2016, the Thai economy is 
expected  to grow at a pace slightly slower than previously assessed. This is due 
to a much larger slowdown in exports  than anticipated  following the slow 
recovery  in Thailand’s trading partners . However, steady growth in public 
spending and private consumption is projected to continue, and that  should partly 
counter impacts from contraction  in exports . 
Inflationary pressures declined  mainly because of  supply -side factors. 
Headline inflation is expected to remain negative throughout 2015, but it is likely 
to increase gradually and turn positive in the first half of 2016 , as the impact of 
base eff ects from the previously high  oil prices  wear out  and as the economy 
gains traction . Core inflation is likely to be  positive  throughout the forecast 
horizon. The public’s expectations  of future  inflation currently remain close to the 
inflation target.  
The MPC kept the policy interest rate unchanged  at the  November and 
December 2015 meetings, judging that the o verall monetary c onditions remained 
sufficiently accommodative  to support economic recovery. This was reflected in a 
greater amount of funds  raised by the corporate sector , the real policy rate that 
remained  at a low level , and exchange rate developments that remain supportive to 
the adjustment of the export sector.  The Committee also gave consideration  to 
maintaining financial stability amid the prospect of heightened  volatility in the global 
financial m arkets, and to mitigating long -run risks to financial stability under the 
prolonged  low interest rate environment.  
 Monetary Policy Report  December 2015                                                         2 1.1 Growth and inflation prospects  
The MPC expect ed the Thai economy to 
expand by 2.8 percent in 2015, slightly faster  
than the previous forecast. First, higher -than-
anticipated growth in public investment and private 
consumption partly offset w eaker -than-expected 
exports and private investment.  Second, a dditional 
government stimulus measures should provide  
some support  to the economy for the remainder  of 
2015  due to  stronger private sector confidence.  
Third, t ourism , following the bombing incide nt in 
Bangkok, is likely to recover at a faster pace than 
the previous assessment.  
Nevertheless, the Thai economy in 2016 is 
projected to grow slightly slowe r than the 
assess ment  in the previous issue of  the Monetary 
Policy Report. Despite the better assessment of 
the domestic economy on the back of stronger 
public investment, private consumption , and 
tourism , it is unlikely to fully compensate for the 
negative impacts of weaker external demand on 
exports and private investment. The Committee  
thus revise d down the GDP growth forecast for 
2016 from 3.7 to 3.5 percent (Table 1.1).  
Supply -side inflationary pressures 
turned  out lower than the earlier  assessment 
throughout the forecast period due to a decline 
in domestic fuel prices in line with  falling  crude oil 
price s. Moreover, crude price s in the coming 
quarters  are expected to  increase at lower rate s 
than our previous assumptions . Nevertheless, 
demand -pull inflationary pressures is likely  
to rise due to better -than-expected  domestic 
household  spending, allowing businesses to raise 
prices of goods and services  to some degree . In 
addition, a  planned increase in the excise tax on

As a result of these factors, the projection of core 
inflation  has been revised up from  the previous 
assessment , at 1.1 percent in 2015 and 0.9 
percent in 2016. The Committee maintained  its 
projection for headline inflation at -0.9 percent in 
2015, while revising  down the headline inflation 
forecast in 2016 to 0.8 percen t.  
The MPC assessed  risks of deflation  to be 
limited . The negative headline inflation  figure s 
could be accounted for  by supply -side factors, 
especially falling  oil prices. Prices of most of the 
other goods, however, continue to increase  overall 
as reflected  in core inflation remaining positive  
throughout the forecast period. In addition, inflation 
expectations remained  close  to the inflation target.  
The Committee factored the following 
developments  into the growth and inflation forecasts . 
(1) Public spending, especially  investment  
expenditure, and government measures aimed 
at stimulating private consumption have provided  
support to the economy.  
The MPC revise d up assumptions of public 
spending mainly on the back of  increased  public 
investment. C entral government  investment  spending  
picked up as the government expeditious ly 
committed to various  projects, resulting in more 
effective disbursements during  fiscal year 2016. 
Funds  of extra -budgetary spending under the 
second phase of the economic  stimulus  package1/ 
were also disbursed  sooner  than expected. 
Furthermore , it became clear tha t investment under 
                                                        
1/  Infrastructure investment on w ater resource management  
and urgent road transport system development  Monetary Policy Report  December 2015                                                         4 the third phase of the economic stimulus  package2/ 
would be financed through  the central government 
budget , with a large  proportion of funds expected to 
be disbursed in early 2016.  State enterprise 
investment should pick up  in 2016  thanks  to outlays  
for the Orange Line  of the  Mass Rapid Transit 
(MRT) . This project should  start earlier than 
previously expected given that the  Cabinet  approved  
it in principle3/. However , current government 
expenditure was revised  down slightly on the back of  
a reduction  in government transfers or unnecessary 
subsidies.  
Looking ahead, the MPC concurred that 
sustained public spending would continue to  
underpi n business sentiment  and boost private 
investment in connection  with government projects, 
such as  investment under the public-private 
partnership  (PPP) scheme for MRT projects , and 
housing  development  projects  along the MRT lines . 
Additional stimulus  measure s aimed at boosting  
spending of the private sector—in particular,  small 
and medium enterpri ses (SMEs) and low -income 
households4/—should spur household consumption 
                                                        
2/ The third phase stimulus package comprises (1) 
measures to promote living standards at  the sub-district 
level, (2) measures to promote  small -scale public 
investment  nationwide  in late -2015  that were in effect  
additional public investment spending, and (3) measures 
to promote living standards at  the village level in the 
form of financial assistance to the private sector.  
3/ The Cabinet’s decision on December  8, 2015.  
4/ Examples include  (1) financial and fiscal measures 
(urgent phase)  to promote SMEs, including low -interest 
credit and corporate tax cut for SMEs, (2) financial and 
fiscal measures t o boost the real estate sector through 
the reductio n of transfer and mortgage fees, together 
with mortgage provided by the Government Housing 
Bank for low -income property buyers, and (3) tax 
measures to prom ote domestic investment by allowing  
business operators to use new invest ment expenses for 
tax deduction . Monetary Policy Report  December 2015                                                         5 and provide more liquidity for businesses, especially  
in the beginning of 2016 when most of the measures 
become effective, thereby  sustain ing  the economic 
growth momentum to some extent.  
According to the Committee’s assessment, 
overall public spending could turn out higher than  
the baseline assumption . The  upside risk factor s are 
that the government could  accelerate  investment  
spending  more than expected —both budgetary and 
extra -budgetary funds —and that state enterprise s 
could  expedite new investment. The downside risk i s 
that limited efficiency o f the disbursement  of public 
agencies could cause delays in some disbursement s 
of funds.  
(2) The impacts of d rought  in 2015 were  
in line with the previous assessment ; however,  
water supply in the dams remain ed low.  
The MPC evaluated  the impacts of the 2015 
drought to be in line with  the previous assessment , 
according to which  the amount of rainfall during  
MayJune 2015  (which was less than usual due t o 
the delay of the rainy season ) would return  to normal 
in 2015 Q3 (Chart 1.1) . As a result, farm workers  
increasingly  moved back to the agricultural  sector, 
having earli er moved to non -agricultural sector , 
espec ially construction and trading sectors  
(Chart 1.2) . 
The Committee expected  the drought  in 
2015  would  cause water  supply  in dams to remain 
low through the first half of 2016.  This will affect farm 
output, especially off -season rice production which 
requires irrigated water. H owever, based on rainfall 
forecasts made by several agencies predicting  
irregular rainfall  patterns  to cease in the first half of  
2016 , the MPC expect ed farm activities to return to 
normal in the second half of 2016, with downside 
risks in the case that the impacts of El Niño turn out

affect the manufact uring  sector because the 
government and businesses had made preparations , 
including the use of groundwater  as a supplement,  
in the event of water shortage . Compared with the 
assessment in the previous issue of the Monetary 
Policy Report , the overall impact s of the drought 
have not increase d and therefore should not  further 
weigh on household consumption  (Box: D rought  
risks in 2016) . 
(3) Trading partners’ economies are set 
to expand  at a slower  rate than previously 
assessed, especially with weaker -than-projected  
growth in Asian economies and the U.S. (Table 
1.2).  
The MPC revised down  the assumptions 
of growth in trading partners’ economies  throughout  
the forecast period.  In particular, Asian economies 
would be  affected by the more pronounced 
slowdown in China and  by the slowdown in the  
U.S. due to a larger -than-expected decline in 
exports  in line with  the slowdo wn in the trading 
partners of the  U.S. 
The slowdown in Thailand’s trading partners ’ 
economies had a direct impact on the demand for 
Thai goods and was a factor  in keeping prices of 
Thai exports in several categories  at low levels . 
The slowdown in China in particular  drove down 
commodity prices because China is a major 
consumer of commodities.  Moreover, plunging 
global oil prices weighed down  prices of oil-related  
product s, such as petroleum and petrochemical 
products, chemicals , and rubber. Therefore, 
growth of Thai export value was revised down 
from the previous assessment  both in terms of 
quantity and price.

trading partners’ economies weakened  private 
sector confidence. At the same time, declining 
manufacturing activities  following  falling exports 
resulted in considerable  excess production capacity . 
Most businesses thus  deferred  their investment  
plans  while awaiting clearer signs of economic 
recovery.  
Exports of services were  likely to register a 
steady growth . The number of foreign tourists 
picked up faster than expected following the 
bombing incident in August 2015. In particular, the 
number of Chinese tourists quickly rebounded  
thanks to  marketing campaigns  aimed at  Chinese 
visitors  in order to offset the impacts of a decline 
in the  number of tourists from other countries.  The 
downgrades of Thailand’s  civil aviation safety 
rating by the U.S. Federal  Aviation Administration 
(FAA) i s expected to have limited impacts on 
tourists’ decision  to visit Thailand , as there are 
relatively not many serviced flights  between 
Thailand and the U.S. provided by Thai  carriers . 
Moreover, the Committee was of the view that 
Thai tourism would  not be significantly affected by 
the geopolitical risks provided that the problem did 
not persist or escalate. The Committee therefore 
increase d the projection  of the number of foreign 
tourists  from our earlier assessment,  from 29.4 
million to 29.8 million  for 2015 , and from 30.3 
million to 30.9  million for 2016 . 
The Fed’s decision to raise the policy rate 
at the FOMC meeting on December 16, 2015 was 
consistent with the MPC’s earlier assessment. The 
federal funds rate was expected to rise gradually 
so as  not to undermine the recovery of the U.S. 
economy. However, t he Fed’s monetary policy 
normalization  may c reate  volatility in financial 
market s and capital flows  going forward .  Monetary Policy Report  December 2015                                                         8 According to the Committee’s assessment  
of the balance of risks with respect to  the trading 
partners’ economies , downside risks  would  dominate  
for the following reasons: (1) growth in China and 
Asian economies could be lower than expected ; 
( ) the impacts of the Fed’s policy rate hike on 
emerging market economies may be  larger than 
anticipated ; and (3)  conflicts in  international politics  
may persist and affect trading partners’ economies 
more than the baseline projection . However, 
trading partners’ economies may experience higher  
growth than the baseline projection if additional 
monetary easing spur red stronger growth in the 
euro area and Japan.  
(4) Global oil prices declined  by more 
than expected in 2015 Q4 (Chart 1.3 ). 
The MPC revised down the  assumption s for 
crude oil price s throughout the forecast horizon , with 
the average prices of  51.2 and 43.0  U.S. dollar s a 
barrel in 2015 and 2016 , respectively.  The revision 
followed the decline  in oil prices  in 2015 Q4 , brought 
about by large  global oil inventory and OPEC’s 
decision not to impose production quotas at its 
December 2015 meeting , which underpinned investor  
expectations of subdued global oil price s going 
forward.   
The Committee thus  projected  crude oil 
prices to remain  at low levels in the  downward cycle  
for some time. The oil prices should show clear 
signs of upward trend again only if the global 
economy show clearer signs of recovery, or if there 
were incidents affect ing the world’s major oil 
producers  (Char t 1.4) .  
The above projection  of declining global oil 
prices would consequently affect  the outlook for 
domestic retail oil prices  and headline inflation.

from the Global Financial Data and the IMFGlobal oil price index ( 1900 = 100)Monetary Policy Report  December 2015                                                         9 projection  that headline inflation will  turn positive in 
the first half of 2016, given  the waning impacts of the 
high oil price  base , the baseline assumption of a 
gradu al rise in global oil prices , and the recovery  in 
the domestic economy . 
The MPC assessed  the risk that the Dubai 
oil price would  be below  the baseline assumption 
roughly equal to the risk that it would  exceed the 
baseline.  Crude price s could fall below the baseline 
projection  for the following reasons : (1) global 
demand could be lower than  the current  
assessment  if the global economy recover ed only 
slowly ; and (2) s hale oil producers could expand 
production faster  than expected. On the other 
hand, crude oil price could rise above  baseline 
assumption  if the Middle East conflict escalate d 
and led to a fall in global oil production . 
 Risks to Growth and Inflation Forecasts  
 The MPC assessed risks to growth 
tilted to the downside , as reflected in the 
growth fan chart  that (Chart 1. 5). Downside risks 
to economic growth  are as follows : (1) trading 
partners’ economies, especially China  and Asia , 
could gr ow more slowly than anticipated;  (2) 
international conflict s could intensify, undermining 
global economic recovery and tourist confidence 
more than expected ; and (3) drought could turn out 
to be more severe , affecting farm and manufacturing 
production by more than anticipated. On the other 
hand, upside risk factors to growth could  arise 
from the following sources: (1) the government’s 
economic stimulus measures could  have a more 
pronounced impact on pr ivate spending than 
expected ; and (2) public spending, especially on 
investment projects, could be expedited more 
quickly  than anticipated . Overall, t he above risks 
could cause growth to be higher or lower than the

impact of uncertainty on business investment . For 
headline and core inflation , the Committee 
judged the balance of risks also tilted to the 
downside (Charts 1.6 and 1.7)  based on the risk 
that demand -side pressures could be so fter if 
economic growth happened to fall  short of the 
baseline projection.    
1.2 Monetary policy decision   
 The MPC kept the policy rate  unchanged  
at its November 4 and December 16, 2015 
meetings , judging that overall monetary policy 
conditions remained sufficiently accommodative  to 
support economic recovery . This was reflected in 
the increase in the amount of funding raised by 
the business sector, the real policy rate that 
remained steady at  a low level, and exchange rate 
developments that remain support ive to the 
adjustment of the export sector. The Committee 
also gave  consideration  both to maintaining  
financial stability under  the prospect of heightened 
global financial market volatility  and to mitigating 
risks to long-term domestic  financial stability that 
could accumulate under a  prolonged low interest 
rate environment.  
 Looking ahead , the Committee was of the 
view that monetary policy stance should continue 
to be accommodative to support Thailand’s  
economic recovery. The Committee would  continue  
to closely monitor developments in the global 
financial market s and the impacts of the domestic 
fiscal stimulus on economic recovery. In addition, 
the MPC would  monitor  and evaluate  imbalances 
which  might build up , such as search -for-yield

as a result of the prolonged low interest environment . 
 At the MPC meetings on November 4 and 
December 16, 2015, the Committee assessed 
Thailand’s economic recovery to be gradual, 
driven mainly by public spending and tourism 
growth. Moreover, overall private spending was 
projected to expand during the last quarter of the 
year. However, economic recovery faced  a number 
of negative factors  due to stronger evidence  of a 
slowdown in major trading partners’ economies, 
especially in China and the ASEAN.  Overall 
inflationary pressures stabilized at low levels due 
primarily to declining global oil prices. Going 
forward , as the base effect  starts to disappear  and 
with economic recovery , headline inflation was 
expected to increase gradually and turn positive in 
the first half of 2016 , which was pushed back from 
our previous projection.  
Moreover, g lobal and regional financial 
market conditions remained volatile, mainly 
because of shifting market expectations over the 
timing of the Fed’s policy rate hike. From the 
second half of September to October,  global 
financial market volatility temporarily dec lined , with 
capital inflows  returning  to emerging Asian 
markets  as the markets expected  that the Fed 
would not increase the policy rate in October. This 
resulted in a rather rapid appreciation of the baht 
against the U.S. dollar  in the first half of Octobe r. 
Between the MPC meetings on  November 4 and 
December 16, 2015, it became  more likely that the 
Fed would raise the policy rate in December, as 
the U.S. economic indicators turned to be better 
than market expectations. In addition , due to  the 
Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) 
communication  on monetary policy  going forward , 
foreign investors continuously reduce d their asset Monetary Policy Report  December 2015                                                         12 holdings in emerging markets , including Thailand . 
This led to a return of greater financial  market  
volatility and the baht depreciation against the 
U.S. dollar.  
Under these circumstances, the MPC 
voted unanimously to leave the policy rate 
unchanged at 1.50 percent  at the two meetings . 
The decision took into consideration  the 
effectiveness of additiona l policy easing  in 
facilitating  economic recovery, which remained 
gradual and not yet broad -based , and low 
inflationary pressures versus the consequences  of 
further easing  on financial market stability and 
long-term financial stability.  The MPC concluded 
the following. First,  further policy easing having  only 
marginal effects on the real economy  partly because 
banks remained cautious about  lending  given 
concerns over deteriorating loan quality . Second, 
overall monetary conditions were deemed 
accommodative  as reflected in the increase d 
funding  raised by the business sector and the real 
interest rate that remained at a low level. Third, 
exchange  rate developments  remained conducive 
to economic recovery  despite displaying some 
fluctuations in some earlier periods.  Fourth , 
government spending and economic stimu lus 
would  help shore up  private sector confidence  and 
boost  business demand for activities related to 
public investment. Therefore,  the policy rate  was 
left unchanged  at th ese meeting s in order to 
preserve the policy space for  downside risks that 
could arise in the future, for instance,  the 
possibility that the Chinese slowdown might prove 
to have  more negative impacts on the Thai 
economy than previously assessed.  
The MPC agreed that monetary policy at 
this juncture  should give more weight to 
preserving  financial market stability by preventing Monetary Policy Report  December 2015                                                         13 further uncertainties at the time when  financial 
markets remain ed volatile and sensitive to 
monetary policy shifts in major industrial economies.  
Some MPC members were concerned with 
exchange rate adjustments which, at times, may 
not have been conducive to economic recovery . 
This situation , together with  the impacts of the 
Fed’s monetary policy shift on the baht,  warra nted 
constant monitoring . A majority of MPC members 
stressed the importance of monitoring financial 
stability risks , such as the search -for-yield 
behaviors , that could arise in the prolonged low 
interest rate environment.  
The C ommittee agreed that, g oing forward,  
monetary policy should remain adequately and 
continually accommodative to support gradual 
recovery of the Thai economy. Government 
measures would also gradually play a greater role. 
However, changes in the global trade structure 
and Thailand’ s declining  competitiveness in some 
product categories would  continue to weigh on  
the recovery of the export sector  despite the  
continued recovery in the global economy , in 
particular the advanced economies . The MPC 
thus underlined the need for structural adjustment 
in the export sector , in terms of both goods and 
services, in order to raise competitiveness. The 
MPC  would  continue to closely monitor downside 
risks to the Thai economy, especially the 
slowdown of the global  economy and uncertain ty 
in financial market s. The Committee would stand  
ready to utilize all available policy tools to support  
economic recovery and safeguard financial stability.

Percent2016 201718 Monetary Policy Report  December  2015 Drought risks in 2016  
Every year f rom November to April, Thailand experiences its dry season , with lower 
rainfall than in any other times of the year . Most water  usage  during this time will rely mainly 
on water from dams and natural res ervoirs, where  water supply  depend on the amount of 
rainfall during  the previous year’s rainy season . However,  volatile weather patterns  in some 
years could  lead to drought. During the last months of 2014 , El Niño  caused irregular rainfall 
and low water supply  in dams in November 2014. The water  supply  is used  for consumption, 
preservation of the ecosystem (e.g. , saltwa ter push back), industrial purposes , and farming 
activities during the dry season of 2015 (between November 2014 and April 2015). As a 
result, the government  asked  farmers to refrain from planting rice in the off-season—that 
would require significant use of water—so as  to ensure adequate water  supply  until the 
subsequent rainy season which start ed in May 2015. These policy measures resulted in a  
43 percent reduction in off -season rice production  in 2014/2015  compared with the previous 
crop year.  
At the start of the 2015 rainy 
season, El Niño  still persisted  and later 
became  most severe since 1997 . Rainfall 
delayed  during January June 2015 and 
turned out to be  lower  than the previous 
year and indeed  significantly  below  the 
historical  average.  As a result, the country -
wide water supply  in dams as of 1 November  
2015 drop ped 29 percent  below  the usual  
5-year average  (2006 -2010) and  8 percent 
lower than the previous year’s figure  
(Chart 1) . Concerns  heightened  over the 
possible shortage of water for economic 
and environmental activities. It was therefore necessary for the government to in troduce 
additional measure s to reduce in -season ric e planting , causing the in-season rice production 
to fall from the previous year.  
A closer look at the water supply  in dams in various  region s shows that available  
water supply  in the Northern, Northeastern , and the Central regions  is much  lower than the 
previous year (Chart 2)  especially in the major dams  (namely , the Bhumibol, Sirikit, and 
Pasak Jolasid Dam s. Consequently , there are risks that the available water supply  may be 
insufficient for use during the first half of the dry season in 2016. Given the current water 
supply  and c oupled with the persistent  impacts  of El Niño , the drought situation may worsen . 
The government has therefo re issued the Water Management Plan  for the Drought Season in 
2016. The Royal Irrigation Department plans a n additional  4 percent reduction in irrigated 
water next year1/ (Chart 3)  and has prioritized  water usage activities  in the order of 
importance,  namely  water for consumption, preservation  of the ecosystem, industrial  
purposes , and farm ing respectively.  The amount of wa ter supplied to non -farm activities is not 
much  relative to  the amount  irrigated to farm activities. For the manufacturing  sector, in 
addition to the government’s water management plan, most industrial estates have also

estimated  not to have significant impacts on the manufacturing s ector . Nonetheless, some 
areas located in the downstream of the Chao Phraya and Mae Klong river basins  are prone to 
the risk of saltwater intrusion along the streams, which degrade s the quality of water and 
make it unsuitable for  manufacturing  purposes . 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In terms of water discharged for farming  in 2016, the government plans to cut water 
supply  by 17 percent from the previous year. This will affect off -season ri ce growing , which 
requires high  water  usage , especially in the Northern, Central , and Northeastern regions that 
altogether account for 97 percent of the country’s total off -season rice farming  area.  Crops 
that need  little water  (namely  sugarcane, cassava , and corn ) may be somewhat  affected. The 
government has recognize d the potential  impacts of the drought and has  therefore  introduced 
measures to assist affected farmers . These include training  and providing  production inputs , 
together with financial assistance such as loan  repayment postponement  and extension fo r 
farmers who have borrowed  from state financial institutions.  
With regard  to the outlook for  the 
rainy season in 2016 ( MayOctober),  the 
probability of El Niño  during this period is 
lower compared with the first half of the 
year according to the International Research  
Institute for Climate and Society  (IRI)2/ 
(Chart 4) . However, it remains a risk that 
requires monitoring. The BOT expects 
drought to result in  a contraction in off -
season rice production  in the first half of 
2016 relative to  the same period last year. 
Therefore,  farm incom e growth is projected  
to be  only 2.3 percent  and could be lower  
if the impacts from the El Niño  are greater 
than forecast . Incidentally, in the absence 
of drought , farm income  is estimated to 
rise by 3.1 percent .

increasing risks of  drought in order to induce a change in behavior and promote more

2.1 The global economy  
The global  economy  grew at a slower  
pace  than assessed  in the previous  Monetary  
Policy  Report , given  the weaker  outlook  for China  
and Asian  economies  and despite  the continued  
growth  in advanced  economies .  
China  and other  Asian  economies  
(excluding  Japan)  expanded  at a slower  rate 
than  in previous  quarters . In 2015  Q3, the 
Chinese  econom y grew  by 6.9 percent  (yoy) , 
slightly  slower  than  7.0 percent  in the second  
quarter.  Whereas  China’s  service  sector  still 
expanded , the manufacturing  sector  continued  to 
slow. Preliminary  data for 2015  Q4 pointed  to a   The global  economy  was likely  to expand  at a slower  pace  than forecast  in 
the previous  Monetary  Policy Report  due mainly  to the economic  slowdown  in 
China  and other  Asian  economies.  Advanced  economies  continued  to grow : the 
U.S. economy  posted strong  growth , while  the euro area and Japan  were  likely  to 
pick up gradually.  However,  downside  risks to global  growth  increased  due to the 
continued  slowdown  of the Chinese  economy,  persistently  depressed  commodity  
prices,  and ongoing  geopolitical  risks.  Financial  conditions  in emerging  markets  
could  experience  more  volatility  following  the Fed’s  policy  rate increase,  which  in 
effect  brought  about  greater  monetary  policy  divergence  among  major  economies.  
  The Thai economy  continued  to recover,  driven  mainly  by public  spending  
and private  consumption.  Tourism  began  to show  clear  signs  of recovery  in 
October  2015.  However,  the recovery  was still not robust  as export s remained  
weak , weighed  down  by the slowdown  in trading  partners , especially  the ASEAN  
economies  which  were  increasingly  affected  by China’s  slowdown.  Moreover,  
Thai exports  were  also held down  by the loss of competitiveness  resulting  from 
structural  problems  and changes  in the global  trade  structure.  Private  investment  
so far remained  subdued.

investment  especially  in the real estate  sector  with 
elevated  excess  supply . In addition,  investment  in 
the manufacturing  sector  remained  subdued  
because  firms  in this sector  were  constrained  by 
weaker  financial  positions  and rising  debt (Chart  
2.1). Nevertheless,  consumption  remained  broadly  
stable  as reflected  in the retail  sales  reading  
broadly  similar  to the previous  quarter,  thereby  
somewhat  support ing economic  growth.  In 
October  2015  the Chinese  administration  eased  
monetary  measures  by reducing  the policy  
interest  rate and the Reserve  Requirement  
Ratio (RRR)  to provide  additional  economic  
stimulus .  
The Chinese  economic  slowdown,  
especially  in investment,  weighed  down  
China’s  imports  and global  commodity  prices,  
which  adversely  affected  Asian  exports.  In 
2015  Q3, several  Asian  economies  (excluding  
China  and Japan)  continued  to post lower  growth  
than in the previous  quarter  (Chart  2.2). This was 
due to weaker  domestic  demand  and shrinking  net 
exports,  particularly  expo rts to China,  despite  the 
increase  in the volume  of export s by some  
countries  thanks  to the launch  of new electronic  
products.  Preliminary  Q4 data suggested  that 
Asian  economies  (excluding  China  and Japan)  
would  continue  to grow  at a slower  pace  as a 
result  of subdued  domestic  demand  and 
weakening  net exports  (Chart  2.3). 
Advanced  economies  on the whole  
continued  to expand  (Chart  2.4). In 2015  Q3, 
the U.S. economy  grew  by 2.1 percent  (qoq

had taken  place  during  the first half of the year,  
and to a contraction  of net exports,  which  resulted  
from a stronger  U.S. dollar  and weak  demand  
from trading  partners’  economies.  Meanwhile,  
domestic  demand  was strong,  supported  by 
growing  consumer  confidence,  higher  income , and 
more  favorable  labor  market  conditions.  
The euro  area economy2/ grew  at a rate 
of 0.3 percent  (qoq sa) in 2015  Q3, slightly  down  
from 0.4 percent  in the previous  quarter.  Germany  
and Italy posted  slower  growth,  while  France  and 
Spain  continued  to expand . Growth  in the euro 
area was underpinned  by private  consumption   
on the back  of low oil prices  and improving  
employment . Accommodative  monetary  policy  
should  foster  continued  expansion  of credit  and 
private  consumption  in Q4. However,  weak exports  
remained  a factor  weighing  on the economy . 
Japan  returned  to growth  in 2015Q3 , 
showing  a 0.3 percent  (qoq sa) expansion  
following  a 0.2 percent  contraction  in the preceding  
quarter . The rebound  was partly  because  of the 
pickup  in demand  after the unusual ly inclement  
weather  in the previous  quarter  and because  of 
growth  in non-residential  private  investment.  
Preliminary  Q4 data,  such as consumer  confidence  
and automobile  sales,  indicated  a gradual  
improvement  in private  spending.   
Looking  ahead,  the Committee  judged  that 
major  trading  partners  would  likely  face slower  
growth  than previously  assessed  and a more  
pronounced  difference  between  advanced  and 
emerging  market  economies.  Downside  risks 
increased  from the earlier  assessment , reflecting

prices,  and geopolitical  risks.  These  risks could  
affect  consumer  confidence  and consumption  in the 
euro area.  There  are also near-term downside  risks 
from greater  financial  market  volatility  in emerging  
economies  following  the Fed’s  policy  normalization,  
which  reflects  a monetary  policy  divergence  among  
major  economies.  
Going  forward,  China  is expected  to 
expand  at a slower  pace  due to decelerating  
investment  following  economic  rebalancing  and 
given  financial  and fiscal  reforms . However,  
private  consumption  likely  continue s to grow  due to 
strong  labor  market  conditions  and support ive 
policies  by the government , such as urbanization  
reform  and the 13th Five-Year Plan on National  
Economic  and Social  Development  aimed  at raising  
household  income.  Exports  are expected  to 
gradually  improve  in line with the global  recovery,  
especially  in the U.S.  
Asian economies  (excluding  China  and 
Japan)  are projected  to slow  down  due mainly  to 
weaker  exports  amid  the slow  recovery  of global  
demand . In particular,  demand  from China  and net 
commodity  exporters  continue s to be subdued  
(owing , in turn, to their weak  exports  and the 
significant  drop in export  revenue s in line with 
depressed  commodity  prices ). This weakened  
external  demand  contribute s to subdued  demand  for 
exports  from Asian  economies.  Moreover,  Asia’s 
recovery  likely  faces further  downside  risks to 
financial  stability  given  the Fed’s  monetary  policy  
normalization . Businesses  in some  Asian  countries  
are highly  reliant  on foreign  borrowing  and 
consequently  susceptible  to the risk of higher  costs 
of borrowing  (Box:  Assessing  corporate  debt risks in 
emerging  markets  and Thailand ).  Monetary Policy Report  December 2015                             25 The U.S. economy  is expected  to grow  
steadily  underpinned  by improved  fundamentals , 
with downside  risks from a slowdown  in trading  
partners  that could  affect  its exports.  In addition,  
uncertainty  remains  over the impacts  of the Fed’s  
monetary  policy  normalization  that could  lead  
to greater  volatility  in capital  flows  or to dollar  
appreciation  that could  affect  net exports,  inflation , 
and economic  recovery  going  forward.  
The euro area is forecast  to recover  
gradually  supported  by accommodative  monetary  
policy  and low oil prices.  Moreover,  exports  
should  pick up as a result  of a weaker  euro.  
However,  the positive  impact  on exports  could  be 
partially offset  by a weak  global  demand  outlook,  
especially  in emerging  market  economies.  Downside  
risks that are increasingly  relevant  are greater  
geopolitical  risks following  the terrorist  attacks  in 
Paris.  The incident  is expected  to weigh  on tourism  
and private  consumption  in the euro area.  In this 
regard,  the MPC  will continue  to follow  developments  
relating  to these  geopolitical  risks and their impacts  
on various  economies.   
Japan  is expected  to recover  at a slow  
pace  thanks  to the gradual  expansion  in private  
consumption  and corporate  profits . However,  
export s remain  vulnerable  to risks and may be 
const rained  by slower -than-expected  recovery  in 
advanced  economies  and a slowdown  in emerging  
market  economie s. 
 
 
 
 Monetary Policy Report  December 2015                             26 2.2 The d omestic economy  
The Thai economy  continued  to recover  
in 2015 Q3  (Chart 2.5)  driven by sustained  public 
spending. Low oil prices and growing consumer 
confidence bolstered  growth in private consumption , 
especially in  the necessity goods category . 
However,  exports continued to contract .  
Nevertheless, economic recovery was 
not yet robust as growth was limited to only 
some sectors. Economic indicators in October 
2015 suggested a gradual recovery, driven by 
sustained public spending and pr ivate consumption  
in necessity goods  and services. Tourism showed 
clearer signs of recovery. However, exports 
remained subdued  in line with  weak activities  in 
trading partners’ economies, especially the 
ASEAN countries which faced  greater impacts of  
China’s slowdown.  Moreover, exports remained 
held down  by structural  problems that constrained  
Thailand’s competitiveness  and also by the shifts 
in global trade structure. Weaker export activity  
and household spending on durable  goods  both 
subdued manufacturing production and private 
investment.  
Public spending continued to expand . 
Public spending, both current and investment  
expenditures, remained a key driver of the 
economy. Funds for small -scale transport and 
irrigation investment projects continued to be 
disbursed. In addition, in the beginning  of fiscal 
year 2016, budget disbursements were expedited  
(Chart 2.6)  for the renovation of university buildings  
and structures , lending support to  construction  
businesses.

introduced in steps since September 2015, partly 
helped  both consumer and business  confidence 
(Chart 2.7) . The stimulus  included measures to 
boost the grass -root economy at the village and 
sub-district levels, lending and tax measures to 
support SMEs, and tax benefits to encourage  new 
domestic investment. Moreover, the governmen t 
introduced measures to support  activity in  the  
real estate sector , providing  housing loans , tax 
rebates, and reduction of transfer and mortgage 
fees.  These short -term measures should help 
reduce excess supply  of residential units  by 
incentivizing homebuyers to sooner purchase  and 
transfer properties, especially condominiums priced  
below 3 million baht which account for about 60 
percent of the total unsold units  outstanding  in 
Bangkok and its vicinities.  
Private consumption recovered gradually in line 
with increased spending on necessities and 
services, but spending on durables remained 
subdued due to  weak  income and elevated 
household  debt.  
 Private consumption in the non -durables 
category, especially necessities and services such 
as telecommunications and transportation, picked 
up slowly . While h ousehold purchasing power was 
bolstered by higher consumer confidence in the 
economic outlook,  due to the government ’s 
economic stimulus  as well as persistent ly low 
inflation and oil prices , spending on durables 
remained generally weak . That was  because  (1) 
farm income contracted due to depressed farm 
prices, especially rubber price s, and also due to a 
fall in rice production  resulting from the drought ; 
non-farm income remained flat (Chart 2.8 ); (2) 
financial institutions remained cautious about  
lending ; and (3) household debt remained elevated .

that was  partly attribut able to the launching of new 
commercial car models  and the  accelerated 
purchase of vehicles  before  the increase in excise 
tax on automobiles takes effect in 2016 .  
 Household spending on services  were well 
maintained and helped underpin the  service  
sector. This was reflected in the continu ing rise in 
revenues of telecommunications firms (Chart 2.9) , 
consistent with increased data usage  resulting  
from change s in consumer lifestyles . In addition, 
the government auction ed the 4G spectrum 
licenses in late 2015. Winning f irms are expected 
to start offering the services in early 2016.  
Exports remained weak in both quantity and price 
terms  due both to cyclical factors associated with 
the slowdown in major trading partners’ economie s 
and to existing structural problems . 
 Cyclical factors in the global economy had 
more pronounced impacts on Thai exports.  
Although the G3 economies , such as the U.S., 
continued to show  signs of recovery , major trading 
partners , especially ASEAN, appeared to be 
harder hit by the slowdown in China.  Moreover, 
existing structural  problems  weighed on Thailand’s 
manufacturing and exports. One example of 
merchandise exports  that suffer  from a loss of 
competitiveness is the hard disk drive s (HDD s). 
Global  demand for HDD s has slowed down  
because consumers switch to new products, such 
as tablets and smartphones that require solid state 
drive s (SSDs), which Thailand is capable of 
manufactur ing only in small quantities.  Apparel 
exports have also suffered from the European 
Union’s withdrawal of GSP privileges in early 
2015. These structural constraints led to  the 
continuing decline in exports values of HDD s and

overall export volume  has continued to contract.  
 Moreover, plunging oil prices, combined 
with lower commodity prices following weakening  
Chinese growth, have led to a sustained  decline in 
Thai export  prices . These falling  prices were  
particularly acute for commodity exports and oil -
related products —such as agricultural products, 
petroleum, petrochemicals and chemicals —which 
altogether account for  14.5 percent of total export  
value  (Chart 2.11) . 
 Nevertheless, exports of some product 
categories still expanded . For example, electronic 
parts and components used in China’s manufacturing  
of new smart phone  and tablet models registered 
a solid and sustained expansion . Thailand’s 
exports of automobile s also recorded a strong 
growth , consistent with increasing  hours  worked  
(Chart 2.12 ), as a result  of a change in production 
line for new car models  and also by virtue of 
having  multiple  export destinations  that helped 
cushion the impacts of the global economic 
slowdown.  
Private investment remained sluggish  given  ample 
excess production capacity.  
 Although private consumption gradually 
picked up, weak exports led to ample excess 
production capacity  especially for export -oriented  
manufacturing , and that eliminated  the need s for 
new investment. Consequently, p rivate investment 
contracted, with the value of imported machinery 
remaining  low in several industries.  Factors that 
weighed down private investment included:  
(1) a slowdown in  external demand  especially 
from China and ASEAN, (2) cautious lending  by 
financial institutions  especially  to SMEs , and (3) 
the government’s megaprojects  that were  still in

restricted  only to some  sectors, for example,  the 
telecommunications industry following the 4G 
spectrum auction.  
Tourism saw a slower growth in the near term but 
started to show positive signs.  
 Tourism continued to lend support for the 
economy despite some temporary  drops  in the 
aftermath of the bomb ing incident in Bangkok. 
There were  stronger signs of recovery , particularly 
in the number of Chinese visitors . Tourist arrivals 
rebounded in October 2015 (Chart 2.13 ), having 
earlier declined for two  consecutive months. Going 
forward, t ourist arrivals were  expec ted to gradually 
rebound , largely thanks to the Chinese tourists, 
during the high season . Nonetheless, downside 
risks to tourism need to be monitored, stemming 
from intensifying geopolitical risks and  the 
potential  impacts of the U.S.  downgrade of  
Thailand’s  aviation safety standar ds.  
2.3 Production costs and price 
 conditions   
Headline inflation for the first 11 months of 
2015 averaged a negative 0.90 percent, owing 
mainly to supply -sided  factors associated with the 
substantial fall in global crude price s relative  to the 
same period last year.  Meanwhile, demand -pull 
inflationary pressures edged up  consistent with the 
gradual recovery of  domestic demand. Looking  
ahead, t he MPC expect s headline inflation to rise 
gradually and turn  positive during  the first half of 
2016, as the base  effects of high  oil price dissipate  
and domestic demand rebounds .

production, especially the development of new 
drilling technologies in the U.S., increased the 
global oil supply. The excess supply was  reflected 
in growing crude oil reserves of non -OPEC 
countries, while OPEC members  continued to 
maintain high levels of production. At the same 
time, global demand for oil remained weak in line 
with weaker growth in China and Asia and a 
modest recovery in G 3. Consequently, global 
crude oil price s and headline inflation readings in 
a number of countries were subdued (Chart 2.14) .   
Thailand’s headline inflation in the first    
months of 2015 averaged -0.90 percent, primarily 
due to lower domestic energy prices in tandem 
with plunging global crude oil price s (Chart 2.15) . 
For the fir st 11 months of the year, domestic 
energy prices on average fell by 14.6 percent 
compared with the same period last  year. 
However, for the first two months of Q4,  domestic 
energy  prices contracted at a slower rat e, as the 
base effects of high  oil price s gradually  waned.  
Cooking gas  price s edged up in line with the 
government’s  elimination of  gas price  controls . 
Raw food prices picked up slightly in line with 
prices of fruits  and vegetables following  volatile 
weather.  
Nevertheless , negativ e headline inflation 
continued to persist. Although the baht  depreciation  
since 2015 Q2 pushed up headline inflation 
somewhat, it could not fully offset the effects of 
lower crude oil price. Moreover, exchange rate 
pass -through  to inflation remained small . A 1 
percent baht depreciation  is estimated to  cause 
headline inflation to rise by only 0.06 percent, with  
most of the effects occurring  through retail  oil 
prices (which move in line with imported crude 
prices  and the exchange rate ). In contrast, the

are marginal because goods  that rely on imported 
raw materials  account for  only a small portion 
(about 16 percent) of the CPI basket.3/ In addition, 
not only pricing  of necessity goods  by firms is  
largely  regulated by the Ministry of Commerce , 
some firms have hedged  against exchange rate 
risks according to surveys of business operators . 
Together with the weak recovery of domestic 
demand an d a high degree of domestic 
competition, firms cannot fully pass on  higher 
costs to consumers.  
Despite  declining  cost pressure s resulting 
from lower crude oil price s, demand -pull pressure s 
picked up slightly from increasing  household 
consumption in some categories. However, 
demand -pull pressure s remained low overall due 
to concerns over future income, especially for 
households hit by drought  and those  working in 
the manufacturing and export sectors , both of  
which faced  greater risks from a slowing  global 
economy . Household debt also remained elevated . 
Thus,  underlying inflation indicators remained low 
(Chart 2.16) , with core inflation for the first 11 
months of 2015 averaging 1.08 percent . That is 
below the  long-term historical  average.   
Nonetheless, deflation  risks remained 
limited due to sustained demand  growth  and core 
inflation  remaining stable and positive . Short -term 
inflation expectations were stable due to subdued 
global crude oil price s. Medium -term inflation 
expectations remained close to the medium -term 
inflation target of 2.5 percent : while 1 -year-ahead

 Monetary Policy Report December  2015   34  
Assessing corporate debt risks in emerging markets and Thailand  
The conduct of m onetary policy 
by major central banks following the 
global f inancial c risis of 2008 has led to 
greater  liquidity in the global financial 
market s. Some  liquidity  subsequently flew 
to emerging market economies , causing  
the borrowing costs and risk premium s in 
these  markets to significantly decline  from 
the pre-crisis levels . This was one of the 
factors that caused firms in most 
emerging markets, especially in East Asia 
and Latin America, to increase their 
leverage , as shown by the rise in the 
corporate debt -to-GDP ratio  (Chart 1) . 
Now, with the monetary policy normalization by the Fed , some  capital flow s have been 
redirected out of  emerging markets . This has driven  up costs of capital  faced by firms , as reflected 
in the higher yields on long -term government bonds  in some countries, and caused  emerging 
market  currencies  to weaken  against the U.S. dollar . As a result, external debt liability , measured 
in local currenc ies, have increased . 
Moreover , subdued global commodity 
prices and a lower growth outlook , 
especially in commodity -producing and 
commodity -exporting countries, have 
weaken ed the corporate  sector’s ability 
to service debt. Chart 2  shows  a fall in  
the interest coverage ratio  (ICR)  below 
its historical  average in most emerging 
markets —and to a particularly low level 
in some countries . In view of the rapid 
expansion  of corporate leverage in 
recent  years  in some emerging 
markets , the current situation raises 
concerns over financial stability  in those 
countries .

5-year average ( 2010 -2014 )Monetary Policy Report December  2015   35 As for Thailand , the extent of risks posed by external corporate debt  remain limited due to 
the following  reasons : 
 Overall corporate debt has 
not expand ed rapidly  and the rate of 
increase is quite moderate compared 
with other countries, especially when 
taking into  consideration the level  of 
financial  sector development . Thailand’s 
corporate debt -to-GDP for non -financial 
sector  was 78.7 percent  in 2015  Q2, a 
modest  increase from 74.7 percent at 
the end of 2014  (Chart 3) . This is 
consistent with the finding in the IMF’s 
Global Financial Stability Report  (GFSR),  
which depicts a 7  percent growth  in 
Thailand’s cor porate debt from during 
2007 -20141/ which is moderate  relative 
to those in other emerging markets.  
In addition, if GDP per capita is used as 
a proxy for the level of financial sector 
development,  Thailand’s corporate debt -
to-GDP ratio is not high compared with 
countries with similar levels of GDP per 
capita2/ (Chart 4) .  
 The impacts of the baht 
depreciation on  external corporate   
debt burden remain limited  because  
Thailand’s  foreign currency -denominated  
corporate debt is not substantial relative 
to that of other emerging markets.3/ 
Moreover, a vast majority of  Thailand’s 
external corporate debt  is incurred  by 
large corporations  that can effectively  
manage exchange rate risks . Some of

natural hedge for their increased external debt burde n. Meanwhile , most large businesses  with 
foreig n currency exposures  continue to  
engage in financial hedges (i.e., financial 
transactions aimed at  protecting against 
exchange rate risks ) and tend to 
increase the extent of hedging  if faced 
with the weakening trend of the baht .4/ 
 Corporate  financial positions 
remain sound . Although the earnings of 
non-financial companies listed on the 
stock exchange (SET and MAI) declined 
somewhat amid sluggish economic 
recovery, firms’ ability to service debt 
remains intact . The current ICR indicates 
that profits are able to cover five times 
the interest expense s, while debt -to-
equity ratio (D/E r atio) remains at low 
levels  (Chart  5). Moreover,  the extent of 
debt considered at risk ( leading to  ICR 
falling below 1.5, which signals higher 
risks in meeting interest payment 
obligations in the future) in the Thai 
corporate sector has remained quite 
steady  since the global financial c risis. In 
addition,  most of th e debt in this category  
largely belong  to the same firms. As of 
2015  Q3, Thailand’s debt-at-risk stood at 
18.9 per cent of the total corporate debt 
of firms listed at the stock exchange, a 
modest level relative to debt -at-risk ratios 
for other emerging markets  (Chart 6) . 
In conclusion , since the global 
financial crisis, firms  in emerging 
markets have significantly increased their leverage, and this  prompts  concerns over financial  
stability of the corporate sector in these countries  against the backdrop of  the slow global recovery 
and the prospect of higher funding costs in the global financial market following  the Fed’s 
monetary policy normalization . Nevertheless  Thailand’s corporate debt ha s not increased

overall financial stability  given  sound  financial positions of and effective exchange rate risk 
management practices  by listed companies . Nevertheless, looking ahead , uncertainty over 
econo mic recovery and potentially  greater financial volatility  potentially  affect debt-servicing ability  
of some businesses, particularly small firms or those with weak financial positions.  Therefore, the 
MPC will closely monitor these de velopments and the adjustments of the Thai business  sector in 
response to these challenges.

After a rise in early September , volatility in 
the global  financial markets declined  as shown  by 
the VIX  index  (Volatility Index )1/ for the U.S. equity  
market and the MOVE (Merrill  Lynch  Option  
                                                        
1/ VIX is an indicator for stock market volatility, measured 
by implied volatility of option prices of the S&P 500.   Overall monetary conditions continued to be accomodative . Costs of 
funds financed by  commercial banks and capital markets remained broadly 
unchanged from the previous quarter . However,  money market rates and 
exchan ge rates were somewhat volatile, driven by  shifts  in investor expectations 
over the timing of the federal funds rate increase .  
 A moderation in income growth caused by the slow and uneven 
economic  recovery of the Thai economy  adversely affected f inancial health  of 
households and firms , especially small businesses . Nonetheless, commercial 
banks remained sound , with high levels of  loan loss provision and capital buffers 
acting as a cushion against  any risks from deteriorating cr edit quality . The 
property sector  slowed down , but the government ’s real estate  stimulus 
measures should  generate demand and reduce some unsold inventories. The 
search -for-yield behavior  among investors  in a prolonged low interest rate 
environment remained visible , as partly  shown by  the extent of investment by 
retail investors in the stock market that edged higher  and by the P/E ratio  that 
remained above the historical average . Fiscal stability  remain ed sound , with a 
sufficient level of treasury ca sh balance to cover below -target revenue 
collections as well as  with a manageable level of public debt. Nevertheless, 
going forward, public debt would likely  rise due to the new borrowings to cover  
rising  budget deficit , investment s in transportation infra structures , and increasing  
fiscal liabilities  associated with economic stimulus packages.

Both indices  fell from the levels observed in  early 
September . However , volatility in the foreign 
exchange markets remain ed elevated  as shown  
by the CVIX (Currency  Volatility  Index)3/ (Chart 
3.1). These v olatilit ies in the financial markets 
were  caused by  the uncertainty over the timing of 
federal funds rate increase  at the same time as 
the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan 
looked set to  continue with monetary policy 
easing . Further more , China’s slowdown  added to 
market uncertainty through  the negative spillover s 
to economies closely  linked to China , especially 
emerging markets , by way of  falling exports  and 
declining commodity prices . 
Such global factors , combined with the 
slowdown in  emerging market  economies , triggered  
capital outflows from equity and bond  markets  in 
the third quarter of 2015  (Chart 3.2). Going forward , 
differing  macro economic fundamentals and monetary  
policy divergence between  countries would  give 
rise to  further volatilit ies in  financial market s and 
movements in  capital flows and asset prices .  
Thailand’s financial markets  
 Money market rates stabilized in line with 
the policy interest rate . Funding cost s of business 
in the capital market also remained steady, 
although they fluctuated from time to time  along 
with changes in investor expectations over the 
timing of federal funds rate increase .

From October to December 2015 , money 
market rates stabilized in line with the policy 
interest rate (Chart 3.3). Similarly , overall funding 
costs of business in the bond market remained 
steady from the previous quarter , although they 
fluctuated along with the medium - and long -term 
Thai government bond yields , which in turn were 
influenced by  changes in investor expectations 
over the timing of feder al funds rate increase  
(Chart 3.4) . Meanwhile, credit spread s were largely  
stable (Chart 3.5).   
In October 2015, medium - and long -term 
Thai government bond yields fluctuated and 
declined in tandem with the U.S. treasury bond 
yields. The decline  was a result of investor s’ 
expectations at the time that the Federal Reserve 
would postpone its first policy rate increase , after 
U.S. economic data , such as employment  figures , 
came in weaker than expected . The FOMC statement  
in September 2015 cited  concerns about the 
economic recovery if the policy rate were  lifted  too 
soon . As a result , investors returned to the Asian 
bond  markets , including Thailand .  
However, from November to December, 
better -than-expected data releases and communication  
by the FOMC about  the monetary policy outlook  
led to a greater clarity  that the Federal Reserve 
would  likely raise its policy rate at the December 
meeting.  Investors, therefore, reduced their holdings  
of emerging market bonds, leading to rising  bond 
yields in emerging markets, including Thailand.  
Furthermore , after the ECB announced monetary 
policy easing that fell short of market expectations , 
together with  crude oil price s that  dropped  further  
sharply , Thai government bond yields became

Going forward , cross -border  capital flows 
and financial conditions would  likely  become  more 
volatile , as central banks pursue increasingly 
divergent monetary polic ies at the same time as  
the global economic recovery remain ed fragile . 
The Committee would  continue  to closely monitor 
developments in financial markets  and their 
implications for liquidity and costs of funds .  
Investment in financial assets   
Search -for-yield behavior continued to 
increase in  the prolonged  low interest rate 
environment  as indicated by rising  investment  
in risky assets —such as  domestic equities , non-
rated bonds , and foreign securities—relative  to 
deposits . Nevertheless , the attendant risks 
associated  with search -for-yield behavior  to 
overall financial stability were  limited .  
 Equity market  trading  slowed  as reflected 
by the decline in the Stock Exchange  of Thailand 
(SET) Index over the past three months . The 
index stood at 1,284.92 on December 18, 2015 , 
down from 1,349.0 at the end of 2015 Q3 (Chart 
3.8) following  the year -over-year drop in e arnings  
of listed  companies due to  the gradual  economic 
recovery . Non-resident investors continued to be  
net sellers  on the back of  the region’s  economic 
slowdown and expectations about  monetary policy 
normalization by the  Federal Reserve . On the 
other hand , resident investors , both institutional 
and retail , were net buyers . For the MAI , after  
the Securities and Exchan ge Commission (SEC) 
implemented measures to curb irregular trading  
activities at the start  of the year , investment by 
retail investors continued to decline , suggesting 
that speculative activities  subsided (Chart 3.9) .

relative  to the earnings per share, with the price-
earnings (P/E) ratio of the SET and the MAI  being 
above the historical  averages  (Chart 3.10).  Going 
forward , there would be  a risk that prices may 
continue to fall further , especially if a delayed 
economic recovery were to affect  the performances  
of listed companies . Nevertheless, risks to financial  
stability should be limited , given  a small proportion 
of trading  was funded by margin loans, which 
account ed for only 12 percent of total trad ing as of 
November 2015.  
 With regard  to the domestic bond market,  
an increasing number of companies recently issued  
non-rated bonds (Chart 3.11) , consistent  with 
search ing for yield in excess of  deposit rates. 
However, risks from non -rated bonds to financial 
stability were  limited, because they account ed for 
only a small proportion  of overall private sector 
bond s outstanding  and were  offered only to large 
accredited investors . 
            The rise in the search for yield behavior in 
foreign securities  by institutional investors and 
mutual funds was also observed  (Chart 3.12 ). 
Some of the funds were invested in countries with 
high credit risks, such as Brazil, whose credit 
rating was lowered  to non -investment grade in 
September 2015. However , risks to overall 
financial stability  were  limited, since most of the 
funds were  invested in countries with investment -
grade ratings. In addition, the risks from 
investment in the Brazilian assets were  small, 
because most w ere invested  in term funds of short  
maturity and mainly held by  large accredited 
investors (AI).

 The baht appreciated aga inst major 
currencies  between  late-September and mid-
October 2015 . During that period , investors  
pushed back the timing for the federal funds rate 
increase  and returned to equity and bond markets  
in Asia, including Thailand,  following disappointing  
U.S. economic data , especially the employment 
figure s.  The baht appreciation was in line with 
most currencies  in the region  (Chart 3.13).   
 From mid -October to mid -December 2015, 
the baht significantly strengthened against the 
euro, due in part to additional monetary policy 
easing by the ECB  to cope with subdued core 
inflation  and to support  economic recovery. As a 
result, the Nominal Effective Exchange Rate 
(NEER) appreciated by 1.2 percent on December 
18, 2015 relative to  the end of 2015 Q3. The Real 
Effective Exchange Rate (REER) rose along with 
the NEER  (Chart 3.14).  
 In contrast to  the NEER appreciation, the 
baht against the  U.S. dollar weakened since mid -
October  after U.S. core inflation and employment 
data came out much better than  expected , 
prompting investors to widely anticipate  the first 
U.S. rate hike to be in  December. Therefore,  there 
were minimal movements  in currencies  in the 
region  when the federal funds  rate increase  was 
finally announced on December 16 . As of December 
18, the Thai baht closed at 36.15 baht per U .S. 
dollar, a depreciat ion of 2.7 percent from October 
154/ (nonetheless  appreciating  0.4 percent from the 
end of the third quarter ).  
                                                        
4/ On October 15, 2015 the U.S. released higher -than-
expected core inflation, and an ECB executive board 
member commented that core inflation  in the euro area  
was substantially belo w target , calling governments to 
play a more active role in stimulating the economy .

2015Monetary Policy Report  December  2015                   44 The volatility of the baht from October to 
December 18, 2015 averaged 6.4 percent , up 
from the average of 5.2 percent in the previous 
quarter .  Nevertheless , compared with most 
currencies in the region , the volatility of the baht 
remained moderate (Chart 3.15).  
3.2 Financial institutions  
 Private sector costs  of funds  and returns 
on deposit remained unchanged  in line with the 
policy rate. Total funds raised by the private  sector  
slowed  from 2015 Q2. A  gradual  economic recovery  
led to subdued new deposit s through  special 
deposit products, resulting in weak deposit growth.  
Interest rates , credits , and deposits  
From 2015 Q3 to November , funding costs 
for commercial banks  stabilized given  that there 
was no change in the policy rate (Table  3.1).

*** Starting in August 2014 , remaining banks include Bank of China ( Thailand ). From June 2015 , they include ANZ (Thailand). 
And since October 2015 , they also include Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank (Thailand). 
   - On December 18, 2015 , the average 12-month deposit rates fell substantially from the end of 2015 Q3, partly due to 
the inclusion of Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank (Thailand), whose rates were relatively low. Monetary Policy Report  December  2015                   45 New household credits during  August  
October  fell relative  to 2015 Q2 (Chart 3.16), as 
households remained cautious in their spending . 
Moreover , the credit conditions survey for 2015 Q3 
indicated that financial institutions were cautious 
about lending  because of  concerns over 
households’  repayment ability  given the slow 
economic recovery and elevated  household debt . 
Housing  loan growth also slowed , owing in part  to 
a temporary factor as home buyers awaited a 
greater clarity on the government ’s real estate 
stimulus package due to be announced  in October .  
The corporate sector  continued  to raise 
funds between  August and October , although the 
amount was slight ly smaller  than that raised 
during  2015 Q2 (Chart 3.17). Seasonally adjusted 
new credits to corporate sectors grew somewhat , 
but it did not amount to a  significant  recovery . New 
loans were concentrated in the real estate and 
renewable energy sectors , while ma nufacturing 
and trading sectors saw a decline in loan issuance 
(Chart 3.18). The drop was particularly large 
among SMEs  due to weak  demand for credits and 
tightened credit standards . The c redit conditions 
survey also indicated financial institutions would 
tighten credit standards for SMEs further in 2015 
Q4. In addition , large firms continued to finance 
through bond  issuance  instead of commercial 
bank loans .  Between August and October , new 
bonds were mainly i ssued by real estate developers  
and telecommunication service providers .   
Outstanding deposits at the end of October  
increased slightly from the end of July thanks to   
a rise in household de posits at commercial  banks 
and s pecialized financial institutions (SFIs).  
Nevertheless,  growth in new deposit s (including 
bills of exchange, B/E ) remained low  (Chart 3.19 ).

Note:  *Change in outstanding deposits at depository institutions ( excluding

as reflected by  continued reduction in  interest 
rates on special deposit products (Chart 3.20). 
Meanwhile, some savers moved deposits  toward 
higher -yielding instruments such as insurance 
products and mutual funds that invest ed in 
domestic as well as foreign assets. Due to 
relatively stable credits and deposits, the loan to 
deposit ratio (inclu ding B/E) stayed  roughly 
unchanged between August and September, 
before dipping  in October owing importantly  to 
credit  slowdown (Chart 3.21).   
Stability of financial institutions   
 Overall stability of financial institutions was 
assured , given the high l evel of loan loss provision 
and capital buffers  acting as a cushion against  
deteriorating loan quality .  
Loan quality of commercial banks 
deterriorated  as a whole , as the slow  and uneven 
economic recovery affected  repayment ability . 
This was reflected by a rise in the non-performing 
loan (NPL) ratio to 2.8 at the end of 2015 Q3 from 
2.4 at the end of the previous quarter (Chart 
3.22). The fall in loan quality stemmed from  large 
manufacturing companies affected by the global 
economic slowdown and depressed  commodity 
prices , as well as from the SMEs hit by the slow 
domestic economic recovery . Meanwhile , consumer  
loan quality dropped  across every loan category  
(Chart 3.23).  
Despite a decline in  loan quality , financial 
system stability remained sound due to prudent 
risk management by commercial banks . This 
included sufficiently high  levels of loan loss 
provision and capital buffers . The a ctual /regulatory 
loan loss provision ratio stood at 153.9 and the 
capital adequacy ratio was at 17.3, well above the 
regulatory requirement of 8.5.

Household sector  
Slow  economic recovery and depressed  
commodity prices led to the reduction in 
household income s and debt repayment ability . 
Farm households were  the most fragile .  
Sluggish economic recovery dented  
household income s. Farm  income s continued to 
contract  given distressed  farm production and 
prices . Meanwhile , non-farm income s (including 
overtime ) remained stable (Chart 3.24). As a result , 
households moderated spending on durable 
goods and slowed down additional  borrowing , as 
indicated  by the decline in growth of household 
debt as a share of gross domestic product  from 
6.5 percent at the end of 2015 Q1 to 6.2 percent 
at the end of 2015 Q2 (Chart 3.25).  
Declining income s, coupled with high 
indebtedness  resulting from  accelerated debt 
accumulation over the recent years , affected  loan 
repayment ability of households —particularly, 
agricutural  households and those with non -
agricutural businesses (Chart 3.26).  For both 
groups  the d ebt service ratio (DSR) at the 75th 
percentile , representing households wit h relatively 
large debt burden,  rose markedly from  the levels 
observed in  2013 , more than any other groups,  
and stood close to the 40 percent5/ threshold , 
indicating a high probability of default . This was 
consistent with a growing non-performing loan 
(NPL) ratio of commercial banks , which  at the end 
of 2015 Q3 stood at 2.8 percent , up from 2.7 
percent in the previous quarter . However ,

as measures to improve the living standards  at the 
village and sub-district  levels , and soft loans for 
farmers , would  somewhat  contribute to lower 
expenses  and higher liquidity among households .  
Going forward , the Committee  would  
continue  to closely monitor the economic recovery , 
which  would have an important bearing  on income 
and repayment ability of households . Farm 
households , in particular , remain ed fragile  given  
the higher debt burden , relative  to other 
households , on account of the draught in the first 
half of 2016 and depressed  global commodity 
prices .  
 
Corporate sector  
Listed c orporate earnings in 2015 Q3 
softened slightly from the previous quarter , but 
overall  financial health  remained sound . Going 
forward , the economic recovery and effectiveness 
of government stimulus measures would  have to 
be closely monitored  as these would  influence  
corporate revenues and financial standings .   
Sales of listed  companies (in SET and 
MAI) in 2015 Q3 declined from the previous 
quarter due to the slow economic recovery and 
falling  commodity prices (Chart 3.27). Moreover , 
debt repayment ability deteriorated , as suggested 
by the decrease in the Annualize d Interest 
Coverage Ratio (ICR), especially in  the petroleum 
industry  which saw a large fall in sales and a 
decline in profits due to losses from  inventory 
valuation  following plunging  global oil price s. 
Likewise , the decline in iron  ore price s led to 
falling  sales , and thus lower profitability , of the iron 
industry  (Chart 3.28). Nevertheless , weakened 
financial positions , especially in the iron industry ,

Source: The Stock Exchange of Thailand, calculations by the Bank of Thailand. Monetary Policy Report  December  2015                   49 posed  limited risks to overall corporate financial 
stability . This was because the industry 
contributed to only 2.3 percent of outstanding  debt 
of listed  companies , and its median debt to equity 
ratio (D/E) stabilized around  at a low level of 0.6. 
Meanwhile , profitability of  the petroleum industry 
should recover , as cheaper crude prices  would  
help lower  production costs . 
 If listed  companies are divided into five 
groups according to their asset sizes , the two 
groups with the lowest amount of  assets continued 
to suffer losses (Chart 3.29). If these smaller 
companies were  used to proxy  the health of non-
listed small and medium firms (SMEs), it may 
reflect  a worsening debt repayment ability of 
SMEs. Indeed, this was consistent with  rising  
non-performing loan (NPL) ratio among the SMEs 
(Chart 3.30 ).    
Nevertheless , corporat e financial position 
broadly remained sound . Overall profitability 
declined only slightly , as indicated by the 
operating profit margin (OPM ) that remained 
stable from the previous quarter . In addition , 
profitablity improved in some  industries  such as 
petrochemical  (which benefited from declining 
production cost s in line with  lower  crude  price s) 
and the real estate  sector  (which managed to  
reduce  transaction costs  and administration 
expenses ). Regarding debt repayment ability , 
although ICR declined  some what , it stood above 
the international standard s of 1.5. In addition , the 
majority of companies maintained a manageable 
level of debt and a sufficient amount of liquidity to 
withstand increasing  risks, as reflected by the debt 
to equity (D/E) ratio and the current ratio (CR) that 
remained stable  from the previous quarter at 0.8 
and 1.6, respectively .

require close monitoring . First,  if economic  recovery  
continue d to be slow and uneven , then the already 
fragile sectors , such as SMEs and commodies -
related industries , may experience more adverse 
impacts . Second,  conditional on the e ffectiveness 
of government stimulus policies , if large -scale 
investment projects could  indeed be completed 
accordin g to schedule , that would bolster  
economic growth and boost corporate financial 
position s. 
Real estate sector  
 Both the supply  of and demand for real 
estates in Bangkok and its vicinities slowed  down , 
but government stimulus  measures  were  expected 
to boost  demand and reduce excess supply  
some what .  
 Demand for real estates in 2015 Q3 slowed  
down , since purchasing power remained weak   
and consumers put off  purchases awaiting  the 
government’s real estate stimulus package that 
would take  effect in late October . Softer demand 
was also reflected in the decline in loan approvals 
for residential mortgage especially in the low -rise 
units (Chart 3.31 ), although the demand  for 
condominiums was steady.  
Similarly , the supply of real estate  in 2015 
Q3 fell from the previous quarter , as indicated  by  
the decline  in new residential project launches 
(Chart 3.32). Low-rise units accounted for the 
majority  of the decline , while the supply of 
condominiums edged up slightly thanks to the  new 
projects along the extentions of mass transit rail 
routes . Moreover , launches of high -end residential 
projects slowed down  after a  large pickup  in the first 
half of 2015 (Chart 3.33). According to surveys  of 
large property  developers , the decline in h igh-end

weaker  demand for such projects . Therefore , this 
should reduce the risk of excess supply  of high-end 
condominiums .  
Going forward , the government ’s real estate 
stimulus measures6/ should incentivi ze prospective 
home buyers to expedite purchases and transfers. 
Moreover, the stimulus measures  should help 
reduce excess supply, particularly of the units priced  
below 3 million baht  that would  benefit most from the 
policy .  
 Fiscal sector  
 Stability of the fiscal sector continued to be 
sound  overall. Treasury cash balance remained 
adequate to buffer the lower -than-projected tax 
revenue collection. Moreover, the level of public 
debt remained  manageable. In the future, public 
debt would likely  rise due to the new borrowings to 
cover  rising  budget deficit , investment s in 
transportation infrastructures , and increasing  fiscal 
liabilities  associated wi th economic stimulus 
packages.  
 Fiscal sector stability remained sound. First, 
treasury cash balance increased and remained 
sufficient to meet unexpected needs and offset any 
projected shortfall in revenue collection this year 
(which would be the second consecutive year7/). 
                                                        
6/ Real estate stimulus measures include 1) loans not 
exceeding 3 million baht from Government Housing 
Bank to support households with low to medium income, 
2) reduction in  transfer and mortgage fees from 2 
percent  to 0.1 percent, and 3) first -time homebuyer  
personal income tax credit.  
7/ Revenue collection shortfall was projected at 118 billion 
baht, as a result of the worse -than-expected economic 
slowdown and the decline in tax collection related to the 
fall in global oil price.  Monetary Policy Report  December  2015                   52 Treasury cash  balance at the end of September 
2015 stood at 426 billion baht, up from 264 billion 
baht in June 2015. The increase was due to 
additional revenue submission s by state-owned  
enterprises and borrowings to cover budget deficit in 
the last quarter of  fiscal year 2015. Furthermore, 
revenues from the 4G spectrum auctio ns on 
November 11 and December 15 would  boost  the 
treasury cash balance. Second, while the p ublic debt 
to GDP ratio increased slightly , it remained well 
below the fiscal sustainability threshold of 60 
percent. In October  2015, the ratio stood  at 43.8 
perce nt, up from 42.8 percent in June 2015 (Chart 
3.34) . Borrowings to cover budget deficit, as well as 
investment s in water resource management projects 
and the urgent phase of the road transportation 
development plan (under the second phase of the  
economic stimulus package) by the central 
government, largely accounted for the increase  in 
the debt to GDP ratio .  
 Looking ahead , fiscal stability would be 
affected  by the following  factors . First,  additional 
borrowings needed to cover budget deficit  would  rise 
to 2.9 percent in fiscal year 2016 , up from 1.9 
percent of GDP in the previous  fiscal year. Second, 
the government would need to borrow  extra-
budgetary funds  for the construction of three new 
motorway routes in accordance with  the 
Transportation Action Pla n that was pushed back  
from the previous year. Third,  additional financial 
obligations would likely  rise given  quasi -fiscal 
activities as prescribed by  the economic stimulus 
packages approved in fiscal years  2015 -2016. 
These include d, for instance, compensations to 
the Thai Credit Guarantee Corporation for SME 
loan guarantee fees, compensations to financial 
institutions taking part  in the soft loan programs for 
the reduced  interest incomes , and the government’s  
forgone revenues due to various tax rebates .
