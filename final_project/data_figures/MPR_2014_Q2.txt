The Monetary Policy Report  is prepared quarterly by staff of the 
Bank of Thailand with the approval of the Monetary Policy Committee 
(MPC).  It serves two purposes: ( 1) to communicate to the public the  
MPC’s  consideration and rationales for the conduct of monetary policy, 
and (2)  to present the latest set of  economic and inflation forecast s, based 
on which  the monetary policy decisions  were made .

Monetary Policy in Thailand  
The Monetary Policy Committee  
Under the Bank of Thailand Act, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) comprise of the 
Governor and two deputy Governors, as well as four distinguished external members  
representing various sectors of the country, with the aim to provide monetary policy decisions 
that are effective and transparent.  
 
The Monetary Policy Objective  
The MPC sets monetary policy with the objective to suppor t sustainable a nd full potential 
economic growth, without causing inflationary problems or economic and financial imbalances 
or bubbles.  
 
The Monetary Policy Target  
On December 4, 2013, the MPC and the Minister of Finance signed a Memorandum of 
Understanding to continue using the quarterly average core inflation with the range of 0.5 -3.0 
percent as monetary policy target for 2014. However, due to the dissolution of parliament on 
December 9, 2013, approval of the proposed target must come from the  new Cabinet which is 
yet to be established. In the meantime, the MPC shall continue to use the old monetary policy 
target until formal approval can be sought.  
 
The Monetary Policy Instrument  
The MPC utilizes the 1 -day bilateral repurchase transaction rate as the key policy rate to 
signal the monetary policy stance.  
 
Evaluating economic conditions and forecasts  
The Bank of Thailand considers information from all sources, the macroeconomic model, data 
in each economic sector, as well as direct opinions from large enterprises and small and 
medium -sized  enterprises from all over the country,  and various financial institutions to ensure 
that economic evaluations and forecasts are accurate and covers all aspects, both in the 
macro and micro levels.   
 
Moneta ry Policy Communication  
Recognizing the importance of Monetary Policy communication to the public, the MPC 
arrange many forms of communication, both in Thai and English, such as (1) organizing a 
press statement at 14.00 hrs. on  the day of the meeting, (2) publishing Minutes of the MPC 
meeting two weeks after the meeting, and (3) publishing the Monetary Policy Report  
every quarter.  Monetary Policy Report  June  2014

1.1 Growth and inflation prospects  
The Thai economy was likely to expand at 
a slower pace than previously projected , while 
inflationary pressure edged up  slightly  from higher 
costs . 
In 2014, the Thai economy was poised to 
expand at a significantly lower rate than 
previously projected,  owing to much weaker 
economic momentum in the first quarter of the 
year, where privat e spending softened in line with 
the economic slowdown. Meanwhile,  the prolonged 
political uncertaint y restricted public spending, 
particularly in public investment, as well as reduced In 2014, t he Thai economy  was expected to expand at a significantly slower 
pace  than previously projected. This was due to weaker domestic demand 
momentum in the beginning of the year from the prolonged political uncertaint y 
which  affected pub lic spending, as well as household and business sentiment, 
coupled with sluggish export recovery. Nevertheless, after the new political 
development in the second half of the year , the public sector sh ould be able to 
increase spen ding, while private confidence sh ould also pick up, which would help 
boost domestic demand. Improvement in domestic conditions  together  with strong 
export recovery  would help support the economy to  gradually return to normal 
conditions in 2015. Meanwhile, inflationary pressure edged up slightly from the 
previous projection, mainly owing to the pass -through of LPG cost to food prices, 
while demand pressure remained soft in line with the economic slow down.  
In the past two meetings, the MPC voted to hold the policy rate at 2.00 
percent per annum. The MPC deemed the political uncertaint y to be the main risks 
to growth, while  financial conditions did not hinder  domestic spending and  the 
current policy rate level  remain ed appropriately supportive of  economic recovery.

the export sector recovered slowly given the 
marginal increase in external  demand  and 
limitations  in production technology.  Nevertheless, 
in the second  quarter of the year, household and 
business spending started to stabilize . 
The MPC assessed that in the latter half of 
the year, the overall economy was likely to  pick 
up and retain  momentum  to expand  close to  its 
normal level in 2015. This was supp orted by lower  
political uncertaint y, a functioning government and 
a pickup in  private sentiment . As a consequence, 
domestic spending  would improve  and regain  its 
role as driver  of growth  together with the export 
sector , which should recover more concretely  in the 
latter  half of the year (Chart 1.1 and  Table 1.1) . 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Risks that Thai econom ic growth  would 
deviate from the previous assessment  stemmed 
from both domestic and external factors. 
Downside risks included the political situation which 
could put a dent in foreign tourist confidence and 
lower tourist revenue  by greater  than expected. 
Moreover, limitations i n Thailand’s  production 
technology could undermine the benefits of the 
global economic recovery on Thai  exports . As a 
result, the Thai eco nomy c ould recover at a slower 
pace than assessed .

  Core inflation 1.0 1.7 1.4Monetary Policy Report  June  2014                   3 Meanwhile, upside risks to economic 
growth would stem from quick and efficient  public  
spending and a better -than-expected global 
economy. These factors  would help improve  private 
sector sentiment and  their financial position , as well 
as boost  household spending , expand  business 
investment, and improve productivity by more than 
expected . 
On the whole, the MPC viewed that the 
probability of the economy expanding lower 
than projec ted was similar to the probability of 
the economy expanding beyond  the baseline 
case. The fan chart for growth was , therefore,  
balanced throughout the projection period 
(Chart 1.2).   
Inflation projections for both headline 
and core inflation  edged up slightly  from the 
pass-through of household LPG gas price , which 
had been increasing gradually  since last year , to 
food prices . Nevertheless, going forward cost  
pressure should remain stable  in line with oil prices 
and the government’s policy to freeze fuel prices. 
Meanwhile, demand pressure eased  slightly  in 
line with softer  economic conditions (Table 1.1) . 
However, in 2014  H2, inflationary pressure from the 
demand  side was poised to edge up  somewhat 
following accelerated domestic spending and 
export recovery. T he MPC thus assessed that risks 
to inflation , both headline and core inflation , tilted 
towards the upside, owing to higher upside risks 
from Dubai oil prices and higher -than-assessed 
pass-through of costs to good prices during the 
economic recovery (Charts 1.3 and 1.4) .

Domestic demand was poised to grow at a 
slower pace following weaker economic momentum 
in the beginning  of the year , particularly in 
government and private spending. At the same 
time, exports recovered at a slow pace, while 
political uncertainties weighed on tourism. 
However, once the political situation subsides the 
economy should pick u p and resume normal 
growth in 2015.  
The Thai eco nomy was poised to expand at a 
lower rate this year  
In 201 4, the Thai economy was poised 
to grow at a  much  lowe r rate than previously 
assessed , in line with a sharp decline in 
domestic demand in the first half of the year 
and the slower -than -expected recovery in 
exports. In the beginning of the year , household 
spending lost momentum , particular ly from  the 
longer -than-expected payback peri od of durable 
goods consumption.  Similarly,  business investments  
were also postponed  to assess the economic and 
political situation . Furthermore, the prolonged 
political problem  showed a larger repercussion on 
tourism as more countries issued travel advisories  
on Thailand, while public disbursements were 
limited, especially those on public investment .  
Nevertheless, after the new political 
development at end-May, public policies 
became more solid. The MPC thus anticipated  
that the government would be able to 
accelerate spending, shore up confidence and 
stimulate private spending to return to normal 
levels in 2015. Public spending was expected to 
increase from the acceleration of budget Monetary Policy Report  June  2014                   5 disbursements , especially those for investment 
projects that were delayed at  the start of the year, 
while the 2015 budget process would be 
expedited to keep with the October 1, 2014 
schedule. Clearer public policies help ed shore up 
private confidence , and when coupled with the 
conclusion of the payback period of durable goods 
consumption , household spending  should pick up , 
while business es should resume investments for  
productivity enhancement and labor replacement 
which  were previously postponed. Moreover, 
subsiding political tension would help the tourism 
sector to resume normal growth towards the end 
of the year. The pickup in domestic demand and 
tourism would help drive the Thai economy 
together with exports which were expected to 
recover more solidly in the latter half of the year in 
tandem with  trading partner s’ better growth  
momentum . 
Although the economy was inclined to 
recover in the second  half of the year, it would not 
be able to offset the substantially  weak 
momentum in the beginning of the year. In 
addition , gains from  public investment would be 
observed more evidently in 2015. As a result,  the 
economy  was likely to grow at a lower rate in 2014 
(Chart 1.5 and Table 1.2) . Nonetheless, stronger 
momentum in end -2014 would continue into 2015  
and lead to higher economic growth. This  increase  
would be  supported by larger  fiscal  stimulus  after 
the promulgation of the annual budget , particularly 
for investment projects, as well as  the resumption 
of normal private spending  levels , and solid export 
recovery  thanks to the global economic recovery 
and the alleviation  of some production problems .

The global economy should recover steadily  
The global economy  recovered steadily, 
led by the U .S. and euro area economies. Growth, 
however, was marginally lower than previously 
expected, particularly  in Asian economies.  
Thailand’s trading partner economies 
were poised to recover continuously, although  
economic momentum weakened  slightly from 
the previous assessment (Chart 1.6) . This was  
due to the higher -than-expected deceleration in 
the Japanese economy  following the  hike in 
consumption tax , while Asian economies moderated  
in tandem with domestic spending . The U .S. 
economy was expected to improve steadily, 
supported by a pickup  in private spending and 
employment. Euro area economies should also 
recover gradually . 
The U .S. economy was expected to pick 
up continuously (Chart 1.7) , despite a slight 
deceleration in the first quarter of the  year due to 
the temporary effect of severe winter conditions . 
The continual pickup would be  attributed  to a more 
solid economic recovery in the latter half of the year

the labor market, as well as the private sector’s 
stronger financial position on the back of rising  
house prices, together with the accommodative 
monetary policy stance. Meanwhile , limitations on 
public spendi ng stemming from  the sequestration  
and restrictions on sovereign debt abated . 
Nevertheless, the U .S. economic recovery  would 
hinge on recovery of the real estate sector  which 
could come to a halt from rising  long-term interest 
rates following the Fed’s gra dual unwind ing of  its 
quantitative easing measures  (QE Tapering) .  
The continual  economic recovery led the 
Fed to gradually taper its asset purchases to 45 
billion U.S. dollars in  April. The Fed also  signaled 
that it would continue to hold the fed funds rate at 
0-0.25 percent per annum for some time to retain 
continuous economic momentum  even  after 
employment and inflation rates approach their 
target levels . The MPC assessed that the Fed 
would hold the fed funds rate at the current level 
for some time before raising the rate in 2015 Q4.  
Euro area economies would recover 
gradually after having broken out of recession 
earlier this year (Chart 1.8).  Euro area 
economies were likely to recover continuously 
thanks to gradual improvements in domestic 
spending and exports. Nonetheless, economic 
recovery remained fragile on the back  of (1) high 
unemployment rates;  (2) persiste nt contractions in 
corporate  loans ; and (3)  the deleveraging  process 
in both private and public sectors.  
Risks of too prolonged a period of low 
inflation increased somewhat. I nflation expectations , 
however,  still indicated that inflation would adjust 
towards the central bank’s target in the  medium -
term.  Furthermore,  additional accommodative

meeting1/ helped shore up confidence that the 
ECB would be willing to ease policies further 
should risks increase going forward. This should 
somewhat benefit economies, especially periphery 
countries where lending rates were much higher 
than those in major countries .  
The Japanese economy was likely  to 
expand at a slightly lower rate than previous ly 
assess ed due to the higher -than -expected 
impact  from  the consumption tax  hike2/ (Chart 
1.9). The Japanese economy accelerated earlier 
in the year, but lost momentum after consumption 
tax was increased,  which particularly slowed down  
household spending. Nevertheless, the economy 
was expected to pick up gradually , supported by  
the government ’s 5.5 trillion yen stimulus package  
which included investments  to repair  for damages 
caused by natural disasters , as well as the likely 
pickup in exports following trading partners’ 
economic recovery and weaker yen.   
Looking ahead, risks to the Japanese 
economy included higher -than-expected repercussion s 
from the consumption tax hike, while government 
stimulus measures may be able to  compensate  
the economic slowdown  only slightly.  As a result, 
the Bank of Japan would maintain its accommodative

policy rate and retaining its plan to increase the 
monetary base (Q -squared) by 60-70 trillion yen  a 
year. As such, once inflation accelerates and the 
output gap starts to narrow from mid -year 
onwards , the possibility of additional  policy easing 
should decline.  
The Chinese economy was expected to 
expand at a somewhat slower pace than 
projected (Chart 1.10). Although exports were 
likely to improve in line with  U.S. and euro area 
demand, domestic spending was poised to slow 
down. The slowdown was in part a result o f 
China’s policy  to rebalance its economic structure 
by reducing the role of  public spending  and 
increasing the role of consumption.  The slowdown 
was also due to measures implemented to control 
shadow banking loan and liquidity extension to 
businesses which affected investments and 
caused real estate prices to decline.  
Nevertheless, the Chinese authorities 
issued policies to mitigate such effects, for 
example, the implementation of targeted stimulus 
measures especially for SMEs, which included 
extending  the tax benefit period for SMEs and 
cutting the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) for 
local banks. Hence, Chinese economic growth 
should continue and should be close to the 
government’s target rate. Continual economic 
expansion would stem from consumption w hich 
was supported by strong labor market conditions 
and high income growth, while investment 
stabilized. The acceleration in infrastructural 
investment from expedited public investment and 
manufacturing investment, which was likely to 
improve gradually in  line with exports, should, to 
some extent, be able to compensate for the 
slowdown in real estate investment .

Jun 14 (better case )10    Monetary Policy Report  June  2014   Asian economies  (excluding Japan  and 
China ) were likely to expand at a slower pace 
than previously assessed (Chart 1.11) . This 
was due to  softer  economic momentum  following 
the slowdown in domestic spending , particularly in 
ASEAN member countries which implemented  
economic restructuring policies to enhance 
economic  stability.  Nonetheless, most Asian 
economies were likely to expand continuously, 
driven by export growth  following  stronger demand  
from the U.S. and euro area economies, which 
helped offset softer demand from Japan and 
China.  
 Neverthe less, going forward, Asia’s 
reliance on exports could be limited  as a result of  
(1) a decline in global  trade volume growth given 
that it would take time for major economies to 
recover  along with  the relocation of the upstream 
production base s to emerging economies which  
would reduce  imports of interm ediate goods used 
in production; and;  (2) lower correlati on between 
import volume from Asia and GDP of G3 countries 
than observed  before the 2008 global economic 
crisis. This reflected that , looking ahead;  Asian 
exports  to G3 countries would not expand as high 
as before the 2008 global economic crisis. As a 
result, Asian countries may not gain as much from 
the recovery of major industrialized  economies  as 
in the past.  
Exports would remain  the main engine of 
growth  despite slower -than-expected recov ery 
Exports of goods were likely to recover at a 
slower -than-projected pace, while exports of 
services were further affected by the political 
situation.

Jun 14 (better case )Monetary Policy Report  June  2014                   11 Merchandise exports were likely  to 
expand at a lower -than -expected rate, due to 
sluggish increase in foreign demand in the 
beginning  of the year and constraints  in 
Thailand’s  production structure (Table 1.3).  In 
2014 H1 , exports of goods reco vered at a slightly  
slower pace than projected, in part due to a 
slowdown in trading partner demand, particular ly 
from Japan, China and ASEAN count ries. In 
addition, Thailand’s  manufacturing sector also 
faced with  production technology  constraints  
which undermined its compet itive edge in the 
world market , for example, hard disk drive 
products. T he shrimp disease outbreak problem  
also posed another limitation on production . 
Nonetheless, some merchandise exports were 
likely to recover steadily, for example automobile 
and parts,  electrical appliances, petrochemical, 
machinery and equipment s, and processed 
agricultural products. Once limitations on fi shery 
exports subside  at the end of the year, Thai 
exports should benefit further from the global 
economic recovery. This in turn would have a 
positive impact on household income and shore 
up business sentiment. However, risks to Thai 
exports would stem from technological constraints , 
which could undermine the benefits of a global 
econo mic recove ry.  
Exports of services  were likely to 
decline from the previous projection, in  line 
with lower tourist income  due to impacts from 
the political situation. Tourist income  in 2014  
was expected to  decline from the previous  
assessment  after the political situation in May 
2014 led many foreign governments  to issue travel 
advisories  and lift the level of travel warning for 
Thailand, denting tourist confidence.  This, 
together with Thailand’s high concentration of East 12    Monetary Policy Report  June  2014  Asian tourists  who are sensitive to political factors , 
led to a substantial decline in the  number of 
foreign tourists during  mid-year. Nevertheless, 
once the political situation abates, tourist 
confidence should improve and recover quickly 
given that Thailand’s tourism indust ry still 
possesses  distinctive strengths and high potential.  
The current account balance3/ was 
expected to record a surplus in 2014, but 
would  be close to balance in 2015 (Table 1.3). 
The current account was likely to record a large  
surplus after showing a deficit in 2013 , owing to  
a contraction in imports during  the first half of the 
year following weak  domestic demand.  Meanwhile,  
the current account was  likely to trend close to 
balance in 2015 in response  to an increase  in 
import demand for  consum er goods, raw material s 
and intermediate goods, as well as capital goods  
and machinery , in line  with the return of  domestic 
demand to normal cy.

sector was able to resume  normal functions  
Fiscal stimulus  increased from the 
acceleration of  budget disbursements, especially 
for investment projects , and the promulgation of 
the 2015 Budget Act which could be enacted 
under  the normal process.   
Fiscal policy in 2014  had a greater role 
in providing economic stimulus than previously  
assessed (Chart 1.12). In fiscal year 2014, the 
fiscal deficit was expected to stand at 3.2 percent 
of GDP, increasing from  last year’s deficit . 
The political situation restricted public 
spending, particularly investment, i n 2014 Q1. 
However, after the  new political development  in 
May, public policies gained clarity and  the public 
sector was able to resume normal functions and 
accelerate  budget disbursements, especially for 
investment proj ects. Moreover, public spending 
would not be delayed thanks to the timely 
promulgation of the 2015 Budget Act . In addition, 
measures to expedite public spending would help 
increase fiscal stimulus beyond the previous 
assessmen t.   
Assumptions on public spending were 
adjusted upwards throughout the projection 
period (Table 1.4)  after public agencies were able 
to resume disbursements  under the normal 
process . In fiscal year 2014, expedition of 
outstanding  budget disbursements, particularly 
from the capital  budget which were  postponed from 
the beginning of the year,  would increase the 
amount of money flowing into  the economic 
system . The MPC anticipated that the 
disbursement rate for the 2014 budget would 
stand around 93 percent, and expected that fiscal  
stimulus would continue in fiscal year 2015 thanks

which would enable the central government, local

restructuring poli cy which aimed to reduce subsidy 
expenditures and increase the pro portion of 
capital expenditures . The capital expenditure  partly 
includ ed investments under the  2 trillion baht 
Borrowing Bill for the  government infrastructure  
project, selecting only the project that were 
necessary and r eady . 
Nevertheless, given  the high uncertaint y in 
public investment projects, the MPC considered 
supplementary  expenditures from other investment 
projects  which  could increase public spending 
beyond the baseline case to be an upside risk to 
economic growth.  
 
  
   
 
 
 
 
 
Private spending  soften ed 
Private  consumption and investment were  
poised to expand at a slower rate than previously 
projected, particularly in 2014 Q1. Improvement 
was expected in the second half of the year in line 
with the pickup in private confidence after the 
political situation became clearer.

Source: Bureau of the Budget and calculation by Bank of ThailandMonetary Policy Report  June  2014                   15 Private consumption was likely to 
expand at a lower rate than previously 
projected , in part due to lower -than-expected 
momentum from household  spending  in the first 
quarter. This was because households continued 
to spend cautiously given accelerated private 
spending in previous periods , political uncertainty, 
and high household debt, while household income 
grew on ly marginally. Nevertheless in 2014 Q2, 
household spending stabilized , while durable 
good s spending started to show signs of a pick up 
after the previous payback period .  
Furthermore, the MPC assessed that  
household consumption was likely to pick up  
in the latter half of this year and return to 
normal level s in 2015.  This was supported by 
improvements in household s’ financial position, in 
part due to more concrete public aid policies, such 
as the expedition of debt payments to farmers 
under the rice pledging scheme, and the 
maintenance of  people’s purchasing power by 
keeping  the value added tax rate unchanged and 
freezing LPG prices. Improvement  in household s’ 
financial position also stemmed from more 
favorable  employment conditions and income in 
line with exports . These factors would strengthen 
consumer confidence  in spending . 
Private investment was also expected 
to expand at a lower rate  than previously 
assessed, particularly in the first half of the year 
where investments remained  stable and provided 
lower -than-expected momentum.  This was because  
manufacturers delayed investments , both for new 
projects and capacity exp ansion,  to assess the 
political situation  as well as local and external  
demand trend s. Investments were observed on ly 
for necessary replacement s and maintenance  
of machinery and equipment s. Construction 16    Monetary Policy Report  June  2014  companies also deferred investments following a 
cool down in the real estate market  and delays in 
public investment projects.  
Nevertheless, the MPC evaluated that 
private investment, especially in machinery 
and equipment s, should start to recover in the 
latter half of the year . Some businesses  may 
continue to postpone investments in 2014 Q3 until 
public spending plans become  more concrete , 
while some still had ample spare capacity. 
Nevertheless, towards the end of the  year, more 
solid public policies and exports , as well as a 
pickup in household spending should help shore 
up business sentiment . This improvement would 
lead to investment  in machinery and equipment s 
for productivity  enhancement , as well as  increase 
invest ment  for capacity expansion  and for public 
investment -related  projects which were postponed  
from the first half of the year. Investment 
momentum  should continue into 2015 tha nks to 
new investment projects approved by the  Board of 
Investment  (BOI) at end-2014 . 
Nevertheless, going forward , the MPC 
assessed that Thailand would be  faced with many 
structural constraints . These included constraints 
on manufacturers’ technology level which could 
not be modified in a timely manner to keep pace 
with changi ng market demands, limitations i n the 
labor  market  due to labor shortage or skill 
mismatch, as well as problems regarding high 
transportation costs, whi ch were  in part due to the 
proportionately high reliance on fuel. These 
structural limitations could affect long-term 
investment decisions on capacity expansion if 
manufacturers  and the government do not 
cooperate to resolve these issues.  Monetary Policy Report  June  2014                   17 Inflationary pre ssure was likely to edge up  
Inflation ary pressure  edged up higher than 
expected , owing largely to the pass-through of 
rising  LPG cost s to prepared food  prices  in past  
periods along with  economic recovery in  the latter 
half of the year . 
Inflation was poised to increase in line 
with food prices due to  the slightly higher -than-
projected pass -through of costs from household 
LPG prices which had been increasing gradually 
since end -2013. As a result, headline and core 
inflation at the start of the year were  higher than 
projected. Looking ahead , the pass -through of 
costs to good  prices was likely to decline after 
authorities deferred household LPG price  
increments4/, reduced diesel oil price in 
accordance to the Committee on Energy Policy 
Administration’s (CE PA) decision5/ in June, as well 
as asked for the private sector’s cooperation in 
freezing  consumer goods prices for the next six 
months.  
Inflationary pressure from the demand 
side was likely to edge up  in line with the 
economic recovery trend. In the first half of 
2014, demand pressure remained  subdued 
following weak  private spending and slow export 
recovery, as reflect ed by a large  negative output 
gap (Chart 1.13) , thus limiting the pass -through of 
                                                        
4/ Authorities decided to postpone increases in household 
LPG price starting June 2014, holding the price at 22.63 
baht per kilogram (from  the original plan of increasing 
the LPG price  gradually  until it reaches 24.82 baht/kg in 
September 2014) until the energy reform plan for the 
whole system becomes more concrete.     
5/ CEPA decided to reduce  the retail diesel price by 14 
satang per liter, in line with the reduction in world diesel 
price.

speedup in economic recovery from the second  
half of the year onwards , together with  gradual 
closing of the output gap in 2015 given normal 
domestic demand conditions and concrete export 
recovery, would prompt demand pressure to edge 
up and facilitate price adjustments.  
Cost pressure  was similar to the 
previous projection. Baseline Dubai crude oil 
price  was similar to the previous assessment, 
remaining at 105.0 U.S. dollars per barrel 
throughout the projection period (Chart 1.14) . The 
increase in  world  Dubai crude oil price at the 
beginning of the year from unrest in oil  producer 
countries, such as Libya, gradually declined  in 
mid-year after the situation abated.  Moreover, the 
market was concern ed that Chinese dema nd 
could fall in tandem with its  econom ic slowdown . 
Going forward, the MPC expected that oil 
production in OPEC countries would be sufficient 
to accommodate rising demand from the global 
economic recovery. The Dubai oil price was , 
therefore,  stable in the baseline case. 
Nevertheless,  upside ris ks increased slightly from 
concerns over unrest in Iraq which could raise the 
short -term Dubai oil price above the baseline 
projection.  
World crude oil prices were likely to 
remain stable as the expected increase in 
demand -side pressure from the global economic 
recovery would balance out with the expected 
increase in supply -side pressure as oil production 
capabilities  of OPEC members remained high . 
Meanwhile, world nonfuel commodity 
prices declined slightly (Chart 1.15) owing to  
falling metal prices and low agricultural  raw 
material prices  due to high stock s in main  
importing countries, as well as sluggish recovery

metal and agricultural raw material prices were 
expected to trend upwards in line with the global 
economic recovery , excep t rubber and cotton 
prices which were likely to remain low following 
high stocks in the world market. Domestic fresh 
food prices were  expected to adjust up following 
higher price of meat and agricul tural products 
(excluding rice). In particular,  shrimp price was 
expected to remain  high given that production had 
not fully recovered from the lingering disease 
outbreak  while  external deman d was high . 
Moreover, swine price also increased due to a 
disease outbreak and hot weather conditions 
which caused output to decline , rendering it  
insufficient to support  local demand. Me anwhile, 
rice prices in 2014 were  likely to decline from high 
rice su pply due to expedited rice sales from the 
government’s rice pledging scheme. In addition, 
the global rice price was likely to decline given 
high world production and stock of rice. For 2015, 
the MPC assessed that agricultural prices should 
trend downwards following the decline in shrimp 
and swine prices after the disease outbreak 
situation improved and output increased (Chart 1.16) . 
Furthermore, cost pressure was also 
affected by the government’s policy to control 
domestic energy prices.  The MPC adjusted oil 
and domestic retail oil price assumptions down 
slightly  throughout the projection period . The 
adjustment was  in line  with a 14 satang per liter 
reduction in diesel price and the pegging of LPG 
price at the May 31, 2014 . This was in opposition 
to the previous assumption of gradual price 
increments until September 2014 . The MPC also 
maintained the assumption of a diesel excise tax 
exemption and froze the LPG price for the 
transport sector as previously assumed. These

prices  in future periods  at a low level . 
Looking ahead, the MPC assessed that 
risks to inflation would tilt towards the upside 
owing to easier price adjustments during the 
economic recovery period, which could cause 
inflation to be higher than assessed in the 
baseline case. In addition, conflicts in Iraq could 
somewhat raise oil prices in the short -term. 
Alternative scenarios  
The MPC appraised that there were 
various scenarios where Thai economic growth 
could deviate from the baseline case. The MPC 
thus took these scenarios into consideration to 
reflect key risk factors on the Thai economy and 
inflationary pressure , going forward.  
Scenario  1: Government budget 
disbursements  were higher than expected , 
particularly for investment projects , while  
exports recovered at a faster -than -expected  
pace  in tandem with global economic 
condition s. These facto rs would increase the 
amount of money circulating in the economy, 
boost income and shore up  household and 
business sentiment. In turn, households would 
increase spending, while businesses would 
expand  investment  to accommodate both local 
and external demand. Under this scenario, 
economic growth would be higher than assessed 
in the baseline case and would exert further 
pressure on inflation . 
Scenario 2:  Thai exports recovered at a 
slow pace due to constraints  in the manufacturing 
sector , which would hamper exports from fully 
benefit ing from the global economic recovery.  
Moreover,  prolonged political unce rtainty 
would have a larger  impact  on foreign tourist  Monetary Policy Report  June  2014                   21 confidence  than expected , causing tourist 
income  to recover slowly, particularly during the 
high tourist season in the fourth quarter. As a 
result, Thai economic growth could  be lower than 
assessed, while inflationary pressure  would ease 
further  than expected .   
1.3 Monetary policy decision   
 Monetary policy remained accommodative  
In the past two meetings, the MPC voted to 
hold the policy rate at 2.00 percent per annum. The 
MPC deemed that the  current accommodative 
monetary policy stance remained appropriately 
supportive of the gradual  economi c recovery  
amidst risks from the global economy and political 
situation . 
In its meeting on April 23, 2014, the MPC 
assessed that the global economy would continue 
to recover, led by expansions in G3 economies, 
especially the U.S. . Meanwhile, Chinese economic 
growth decelerated somewhat from measures 
implemented to rebalance China's economic 
structure. ASEAN economies continued to 
moderate in line with domestic demand , while 
exports remained strong . Meanwhile, Thai 
economic growth in 2014 Q1 wa s expected to 
contract from the previous quarter. Exports 
gradually recovered in line with the global 
economy but could not offset  the decline in 
domestic spending , both public spending due to 
restrictions stemming from the political situation , 
and subdued  private  spending  following weaker 
confidence. As a result, economic growth for 2014 
was expected to be lower than previously 
assessed, with political uncertainty being the main 22    Monetary Policy Report  June  2014  risk to economic recovery. Financial conditions, 
overall, did not hinder growt h. The MPC viewed 
that the c urrent accommodative monetary policy  
stance  remained  appropriately supportive of the 
Thai economic recovery. The MPC thus voted 6 to 
1 to maintain the policy rate at 2.00 percent per 
annum. One member voted to lower the policy 
rate by 0.25 perce nt to sustain  policy easing in 
supporting growth.  
In its subsequent meeting on June 18, 
2014, the MPC assessed that the global economic 
recovery  would retain its momentum , led by major  
industrialized  economies , in particular the U.S.  
which  continued to gr ow on the back of stronger 
labor and housing markets. In China, risks in the 
financial  sectors subsided  and downside risks to 
grow th diminished in the short term. Mean while , 
Asian  economies remained stable . For Thailand, 
the economy was likely to slow down by more 
than expected in 2014 due to the larger -than-
expected contract ion i n 2014 Q1. Nevertheless, 
the MPC assessed that the economic recovery 
should pick up pace given reduced  political 
uncertainty  and a resumption of functioning public 
policy management.  Fiscal policy should lend  
more support to economic recovery  and help 
boost private spending . Meanwhile, risks to 
economic growth would largely stem from export s 
of goods and tourism. I nflationary p ressure 
increased slightly, due mainly to the pass -through 
of higher LPG costs to food prices.  The MPC  
deem ed that  the current stance of monetary policy 
was accommodative  and supportive of economic 
recovery.  The C ommittee thus voted unanimously 
to maintain  the policy rate at 2.00 percent per 
annum and would stand ready to  pursue 
appropriate policy to ensure a sustained  recovery 
as well as long ‐term financial stability.  Monetary Policy Report  June  2014                   23 1.4 Appendix :

Percent2014 201526 Monetary  Policy Report  June 2014   Recovery of Thai exports and risks ahead  
The contraction in domestic demand that seems to go against the firming up in global 
economic recovery since the beginning of 2014 , has led many to  assess that  the export sector will 
become  the main engine of growth for the Thai economy. However, during the first four months of 
this year, exports still contracted by 0.8 percent from the same period last year. The momentum 
that many hoped  for still ha s not been registered. The  Thai situation is different from other 
exporting countri es in Asia where strong recoveries have  already taken place. Thus, it reflects that 
Thailand’s export sector is faced with not only external factors that could hinder recove ry in the 
next periods, but also internal ones.  
External factors  
 Asian trading -partners’ economic slowdown   
Despite the pickup  in the global 
economic prospect in line with development 
of the G3 economies which has allowed Thai 
exports to these destinations to expand, 
those to Asia have remained in contraction. 
(In 2013, Thai exports to China and ASEAN 
accounted for 37.8 percent o f total exports, 
which was higher than those to G3 which 
contributed to 29.6 percent). The greater -
than-expected slowdown in China’s domestic 
demand and exports, in particular, has not 
only affected Thailand directly via exports to 
China but also indirectl y via exports to 
ASEAN for re -exports to China. (Chart 1)  
 Change in global trade structure  
The global trade structure has undergone a significant change after the global economic 
crisis, resulting in lower growth in global trade compared to that in GDP. This trend is in part due to 
relocation of production bases to Emerging Market economies (EMs), particularly in Eastern 
Europe. For these benefactors, intra -regional trade has increased and replaced imports from Asia. 
Moreover, since the unit labor cost in  G3 has dropped continuously after the crisis, some firms 
have relocated back to their homes. This development implies that Asian exports will benefit from 
G3 economic recovery by less than before. (Details in Box: Recent changes in global trade 
structure)  
 Low agricultural prices  
From 2012 onwards, global agricultural prices have been declining consistently. This trend 
has been due to global over supply of many crops, especially rubber, rice and sugar, which 
together accounts for 9 percent of Thailand’s to tal exports. The problem of low agricultural prices is 
a key obstacle on recovery of Thai exports. During the first four months of 2014, while export price 
contracted by 1.5 percent from the same period last year, export volume over the same period

2013 2014Monetary Policy Report  June 2014    27 actuall y expanded by 0.7 percent. In this regard, the IMF has assessed that agricultural prices 
would continue to stabilize at low levels and this would stall recovery of Thailand’s exports in the 
periods ahead . 
Domestic factors  
Apart from uncontrollable external 
factors, the export sector is also faced with 
domestic structural changes which have been 
significant causes of its sluggish recovery 
compared to other Asian countries. (Chart 2)   
  Constraint s on production technology  
 During the last three year, electronics 
which have been Thailand’s number one 
exports have  lost competitiveness in the global 
market. This observation is particularly true for 
Hard Disk Drive due to firms’ inability to adjust 
production to meet shifts in consumer 
preference along with the fast changing 
technological development. In some way, this 
is due to Thailand’s low level of investment in 
innovations’ Research and Development (R&D)  
compared to competitors  such as Singapore, 
Malaysia and Indonesia. Thailand’s level of 
technological development is also lacking as 
reflected by its innovation ranking in the  Global 
Competitiveness Index  which has decreased 
from 2007. The above constraint s on production  
technology are important hindrance s of 
recovery  in Thailand’s exports compared to 
neighboring countries . (Table 1 ) 
 Increase in Thai firms’ outward investment  
 Problems of labor shortage, continuous minimum wage hikes, tax incentives under the 
Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), and searches for new markets and resources, together 
have led to a consistent increase in Thai firms’ outward investment. A portion of this investment is 
associated with relocation of production bases to other countries instead of expansion of domestic 
production capacity. Thi s, too, is another factor which causes Thai exports to expand more slowly 
than in the past.  
Looking ahead, all of the factors above would present important obstacles to the recovery 
of Thai exports. In particular, constraint s on production technology which  present  a long -term 
problem and low agricultural prices would continue to restrict export recovery for some periods to 
come. Thus, the MPC has decided to revise down the export forecast for 2014 from 4.5 to 3 
percent.

2.1 The global economy  
 The global economy continued to recover 
in line with development of major industrialized 
economies. Meanwhile, the outlook for Asia remained  
stable as improvement in exports was offset  by 
domestic demand  slowdown . 
The U.S. economy recovered more strongly  
thanks to continuous improvement in economic 
fundamentals notwithstanding the impact of 
unfavorable weather conditions during the first 
quarter.  
In 2014 Q1, the U.S. economy contracted 
by 1.0 percent (qoq, saar), following a  2.6 percent  
expansion  in the previous quarter. (Chart 2.1)  The 
contraction, in part, owed to the more severe  
winter which led to a slowdown in economic 
activities, coupled with  a reduction in inventory.  The global economy continued to recove r in line with development of 
major industrialized economies. In particular, U.S. economic fundamentals improved  
consistently in 2014 Q1 , notwithstanding unfavorable  weather conditions. Growth 
in the euro area persisted and additional monetary stimulus was expected to  
provide some further support. The Japanese economy expanded briskly owing to 
accelerated private spending prior to the increa se in consumption tax though 
some slowdown was anticipated in the next periods. Meanwhile, the outlook for 
Asia remained stable as improvement in exports was offset  by domestic demand 
slowdown.  
The Thai economy in 2014 Q1 contracted from both the previous quarter 
and the same quarter last year as domestic demand and tourism was affected by 
the protracted political situation. The sluggish recovery in exports was unable to 
push growth into positive territory, thereby resulting in manufacturing contraction .

Percent (seasonally adjusted, annualized)30                          Monetary Policy Report  June 2014   The outlook for 2014 Q2, however, was 
expected to improve after the impact of 
unfavorable weather conditions in prior periods 
dissipated. Such outlook was reflected by 
improvements in key leading indicators, for 
example, manufacturing and services Purchasing 
Manager s Indices (PMI), retail sales, and 
employment. Real estate indicators also edged up 
after a continuous slowdown since the middle of 
last year.  
The U.S. monetary policy stance remained 
accommodative. At the meeti ng on April  29–30, 
2014, the FOMC decided to (1) maintain the fed 
funds rate at 0 –0.25 percent per annum. The 
FOMC also signaled that this low interest rate 
environment would be maintained in the periods 
ahead even though unemployment and inflation 
moved c loser to targets; and (2) reduce asset 
purchase by 10 billion U.S. dollars per month. 
Thus, overall asset purchase stood at 45 billion 
U.S. dollars, including 25 billion U.S. dollars of 
long-term treasuries and 20 billion U.S. dollars of 
Agency Mortgage -Backed Securities per month.  
Euro area economies  recovered steadily 
and additional monetary stimulus was expected to 
provide some further support . 
Euro area econom ies1/ in 2014 Q1 expanded  
by 0.2 percent (qoq, sa) from 0.3 percent in the 
previous quarter, thanks chiefly to domestic 
demand. In particular, investment increased notably  
in Germany since the beginning of the year.

2013 , Germany, France, Italy and Spain each has a

Portugal together hold 6 percent share in the overall 
Eurozone economy.  Monetary Policy Report  June 2014                       31 Meanwhile, exports from the euro area moderate d 
in line with slowdown in trading partners’ economies , 
particularly the U.S. and Asia.  
In 2014 Q2, outlook for the euro area 
continued to brighten from both consumption and 
manufacturing. Such outlook was supported by 
increases in retail sales and manufac turing 
production in April in line with continuous 
improvement in consumer confidence for seven  
consecutive months and the increase in average 
Composite PMI during April –May from 2014 Q1.  
Given higher risk of prolonged low inflation 
(Chart 2.2) , the  European Central Bank (ECB) 
decided to implement additional monetary 
stimulus.2/ The move was assessed to provide 
some further support to the economies , especially 
periphery economies ,3/ where cost of finance 
remained much higher than that in major 
economies. Moreover, confidence was expected 
to increase thanks to the announcement of 
additional unconventional measures that would be 
implemented alongside interest rate policy. 
Nonetheless, the aforementioned positive impact 
would be limited because (1) current excess 
liquidity was low compared to 2012 after the 
announcement of LTRO; (2) commercial banks 
                                                        
2/ On June 5, 2014, the ECB decided to (1) lower the 
interest rates of all financial products, thereby causing 
the Refinancing Rate, the Marginal Lending Rate, and 
the Deposit Rate, to decrease to 0.15, 0.4 and -0.1 
percent per annum, respectively; (2) provide liquidity 
assistanc e to commercial banks for long -term financing ,

private sector; and (3) the measures lacked 
implementation details.  
The Japanese economy expanded swiftly  
in 2014 Q1 thanks to the acceleration in private 
spending. Though a contraction was noted in the 
second quarter due to the increase in consumption 
tax, it was assessed to be short -lived.   
The J apanese economy in 2014 Q1 
expanded by 1.6 percent (qoq, sa) (Chart 2.3) , 
accelerating from 0.1 percent in the previous 
quarter, thanks to accelerated consumption  and 
investment prior to the increase in consumption 
tax in April. Meanwhile, manufacturing production 
expanded in line with domestic demand and 
recovery in exports firmed up thanks to positive 
development in tradition partners’ economies, 
particularly Asi a (excluding China) and the U.S. 
However, the increase in imports following 
accelerated private spending resulted in only a 
modest contribution to growth from the overall 
external sector.  
The increase in consumption tax from 5 to 
8 percent on April 1, 2014 , caused private 
spending and manufacturing to contract in the 
second quarter. Such outlook was reflected by 
significant contractions in retail sales and 
manufacturing production in April from the 
average value in previous quarter. Looking ahead, 
domestic demand and manufacturing was 
expected to rebound due to planned stimulus 
packages designed to counter the effect of the tax 
increase.

to stabilize after slowing down for two consecutive 
quarters, thanks to improvement s in exports and

In 2014 Q1, the Chinese economy 
expanded by 7.4 percent from the same period 
last year, slowing down from 7.7 percent in the

which improved in tandem  with development  of 
the global economy and buoyant consumption  
expansion  provided the main thrust for growth. 
Additionally, the Chinese government’s commitment

second quarter slowed down from the previous 
quarter in line with non -bank credits. Nonetheless, 
risk management measures, particularly those 
aimed  to curb shadow banking, led to difficulties 
for SMEs to access funding. The Chinese authorities  
thus decided to implement SME supporting 
measures, for example, a reduction in the Reserve 
Requirement Ratio (RRR) for rural financial 
institutions with high p ercentage of SME lending. 
Such effort led to s ome loosening in SMEs’ 
financial  conditions and higher business sentiment,  
particularly for SMEs.   
In 2014 Q1, Asian economies excluding 
China grew at a similar pace as the previous 
quarter. (Chart 2.4)  Key supporting factors of 
growth in this quarter included  improvement in 
exports that owed to recoveries of major 
industrialized economies and buoyant consumption  
expansion. Investment in East Asian economies 
expanded well, thanks to improvement in 
manufa cturing production in line with export 
outlook. Meanwhile, investment in  ASEAN began 
to face hindrances, in part because financial 
institutions became more cautious in credit 
extension to the real est ate sector.  
Economic activities in the second quarter 
remained stable. More responsible government 
expenditure, higher credit standards for the 
corporate sector , particularly the real estate 
sector, and elevated household debt, presented 
greater challenges  to domestic demand expansion. 
These limitations thus offset development  in 
exports, which improved for most countries 
especially  Malaysia and the Philippines, in line 
with the  global recovery following  a slowdown in 
the first quarter , which owed to low trading 
partners’ economic growth. However, Indonesian 
exports continued to contract since the beginning 
of the year, in part as a result of the Minerba Act.

In 2014 Q1, the Thai economy contracted 
mainly from domestic demand as the political 
situation affected private confiden ce and  budget 
disbursement. The gloomy  environment coupled 
with the continuous slowdown in income and the 
overall economy caused consumers to become 
cautious in their spending.  Meanwhile, exports 
recovered albeit only slowly, thereby resulting in 
continuous slo wdown in manufacturing production. 
Agricultural production, however, expanded 
steadily.   
Economic conditions in 2014 Q1  
During the first quarter, the Thai economy 
contracted slightly by 0.6 percent from the  same  
period last  year (Chart 2.5)  as manufacturing 
output continued to contract from the last quarter. 
Meanwhile, the service sector slowed down, in 
part as a result of the decline in tourism -related 
activities.  
The manufacturing sector  contracted by 
2.7 percent from the same period last  year as 
production in response to domestic demand 
decreased. Though external demand began to 
recover, it could not fully compensate the 
contraction in domestic demand, conform to  the 
decline in Manufacturing Production Index. (Chart 
2.6) Capital utilization thus averaged at 61.8 
percent in the first quarter and declined to 56.6 
percent in April. (Chart 2.7)

which caused a dent in private sentiment and

coupled with a special factor arising from the 
reduction in petroleum output due to plant 
closures for repairs a nd maintenance , resulted in 
a contraction of domestic -oriented manufacturing 
production in the first quarter.  
Export -oriented manufacturing production 
continued to contract from the decrease in HDD 
orders from overseas as firms had yet to adjust in 
respons e to changes in demand. At the same 
time, the frozen shrimp industry continued to be 
affected by the Early Mortality Syndrome (EMS) 
that resulted in input shortage. However, 
production in some industries improved in line with 
recovery in external demand su ch as electrical 
appliances, electronic tubes and parts, jewelry, 
and garments that benefitted from the FIFA World 
Cup which began in June.  
It was assessed that production of major 
industries would continue to contract from the 
same period last year. Thes e include automobile 
output which remained subject ed to last year’s 
high base and frozen chicken output which was 
affected by production shortage of a major 
producer that previously experienced liquidity 
problems. Nonetheless, it was anticipated that 
expor t-oriented manufacturing production would 
recover in line with development of the global 
economy.  
The service sector  was impacted as 
consumers were uncertain of future economic 
prospect along with the protracted political 
situation. Hence, the service sector in 2014 Q1 
expanded modestly by 2.2 percent from the same 
period last year, and slowing down from the last 
quarte r. The effect was particularly noted in 
tourism -related industries such as hotels and Monetary Policy Report  June 2014                       37 restaurants which experienced a significant 
decline of foreign tourists, particularly from major 
East Asian countries. Such development was 
reflected by the decline in oc cupancy rate to 60.3  
percent  which decreased from the same period 
last year. (Chart 2.8)  Meanwhile, the transportation  
sector moderated from  the last quarter owing to 
the decline in air transportation.  
In the second quarter, the number of 
foreign tourists was expected to decline from the 
same period last year as the heightened political 
situation in May 2014 prompted more countries to 
issue travel advisories for Thailand. Some 
countries also advised cit izens to review or refrain 
from travelling to Thailand.  
 Agricultural production  expanded slightly  
by 0.8 percent from the same period last year 
(Chart 2.9)  as a result of the consistent increase 
in rubber  production due to increase in plantation 
areas during the past 3 –4 years.  However, 
production of many major crops declined owing to 
unfavorable weather conditions, including rice, oil 
palm, cassava, and shrimp which continued to be 
affected by EMS. Agricu ltural production in April 
continued to expand from improvement in rice and 
oil palm output following the increase in water 
availability from irrigation systems. Oil palm 
production also increased as a result of expansion 
in plantation area in previous per iods.  
The trade sector  contracted marginally by 
0.5 percent from the same period last year due to 
the decline in manufacturing activities.  Furthermore,  
the real estate sector contracted slightly in line 
with the reduction in construction activities by 12.4  
percent from the same period last year ; a further 
decline  from the previous quarter. In this connection,  
construction under government projects  contracted

while construction under private projects contracted  in 
line with the economy and higher costs. This trend 
continued to be observed in April as a result of 
economic uncertainties and delays in budget 
disbursement.  
Nonetheless, the contraction in economic 
activities in 2014 Q1  had not visibly affected 
employment yet, except for the decline in O/T 
hours. The unemployment rate in April stood at a 
low of 0.9 percent (Chart 2.10) . Despite some 
reduction in employment in certain sectors, for 
example, construction which was affected by 
activities, labor was able to relocate  to other 
sectors. Information from the Business Liaison 
Program also suggested that firms continued to 
face difficulty in finding workers, reflecting the 
ongoing tightness in the labor market.  
In 2014 Q1, domestic  demand contracted 
from both the same period last year and also the 
last quarter  (Table 2.2)  owing to reduction in both 
private and public spending . Since exports 
continued to recover only slowly, contraction in 
overall manufacturing production was observe d.

consumption  continued to contract from the 
same period last year. (Chart 2.11)  In the first 
quarter, private consumption contracted by 3 
percent from the same period last year, in part 
because the protracted  political situation continued 
to affect consumer  confidence. Purchasing power 
of agricultural households was also affected by 
low prices of major crops and that of non -agricultural  
households edged down somewhat as a result of 
the economic slowdown. This development resulted  
in deterioration of financial conditions of highly 
indebted households, thereby causing them to 
remain cautious in their spending. The contraction 
in consumption was also partly caused by last 
year’s high base which arose from accelera ted 
automobile delivery under the first -car tax rebate 
scheme. Nonetheless, private consumption, both 
durable and non -durable, started to stabilize in 
April in tandem with adjustment in consumer 
confidence and O/T hours in the non -agricultural 
sector. (Cha rt 2.12)  
Private investment  during the first 4 
months continued to contract. In 2014 Q1, private 
investment contracted by 7.3 percent from the 
same period last year (Chart 2.13)  owing to 
investment in machinery and equipmen ts and 
construction. The ongoing political uncertainty also 
put a dent in business sentiment as reflected  
by the Business Sentiment Index (BSI) which 
remained under 50 since June 2013 and the 
accumulated value of requests for Board of 
Investment (BOI) inve stment promotion certificate 
which was lower than the same period last year. 
Thus, firms decided to postpone investment to 
await greater clarity for both the political and 
economic prospects. However, private investment 
in April began to stabilize in line with investment in

imports of capital goods in the chemical, food and 
beverage, and metal industries.  
Exports  during the first 4 months recovered  
rather slowly. In 2014 Q1, the volume of exports 
grew by 0.8 percent from the same period last 
year (Chart 2.14)  in tandem with recovery in 
exports of manufactured goods , for example, 
automobiles, electrical circuits, electrical appliances,  
machinery and equipments, together with exports 
of agric ultural products. Nonetheless, the value of 
exports of agricultural products continued to 
contract owing to low global commodity prices.  
In addition, exports of some sectors were also 
affected by temporary  factors, for example, fishery 
products which were impacted by the outbreak of 
diseases in shrimps, metal products which were 
affected by last year’s high base that owed to 
abandonment of trade barriers in trading partners’ 
economies, and petroleum products which were  
impacted by plant closures for repairs  and 
maintenance. The last two special factors would 
disappear by the second quarter.  
In 2014 Q1, exports of services contracted 
by 4.2 percent from the same period last year –the 
first contraction since the severe floods in 2011. 
The protracted political s ituation and the 
announcement  of the emergency decree during 
January 22  to March 19, 2014, resulted in a 
continuous decline in the number of tourists  
from major Asian destinations including China,  
Hong Kong S.A.R., Japan and Malaysia as they 
are highly sen sitive to political news. Then,  
the number  of foreign tourists rebounded in April 
after the emergency decree was lifted. However, 
improvement was short -lived due to  a new political 
development in May which caused many countries 
to step up their travel advi sories, which greatly

coupled with  absence of insurance coverage for 
political factors implied that tourism recovery 
would be delayed in future periods.  
The contraction in domestic spending and 
sluggish recovery in exports caused imports to 
contract rather significantly by 12.0 percent in 
2014 Q1  (Chart 2.15) . The impact was particularly 
severe for imports of capital goods, raw materials 
and intermediate inputs excluding crude oil, which 
contracted in tan dem with manufacturing production, 
sluggish recovery in  private investment  and exports 
of goods, and contraction of imports of consumer 
products which declined in line with private 
consumption. However, the outlook for imports of 
goods began to stabilize in April in line with key 
economic indicators.  
 On public expenditures , the role of 
government stimulus weakened compared to the 
first 4 months of last year owing to the protracted 
political situation, dissolution of parliament and 
delays in procurement w hich resulted in a somewhat  
restricted budget disbursement, particularly in 
capital budget and non -budgetary spending that 
were mostly delayed. Meanwhile, revision of 
investment plans by large state enterprises led to  
reduction in state enterprises’ capita l expenditure.  
However, disbursement of current expenditure 
namely salaries and purchases  of goods and 
services proceeded as usual. (Chart 2.16)  Overall 
government revenue collection declined owing to 
reduction in income tax pertaining to decreases in 
the tax rates for both personal and corporate 
income taxes, reduction in  automobile excise tax 
which followed the contraction in private 
investment,  and continuous contraction in tax on 
international trade  due to the slowdown in imports 
of goods.

Inflation  
Headline inflation over the first two months 
of 2014 Q2 continued to edge up from the first 
quarter to stand at 2.44 percent, owing to 
acceleration  in core inflation and energy prices.  
(Chart 2.17)  
Core inflation continued to accelerate from 
1.19 percent  in 2014 Q1 to 1.67 percent during the 
first two months of the second quarter. (Chart 
2.18)  The increase in core inflation still stemmed 
mainly  from increase in  prices of prepared foods 
due to the pass -through of higher prices of LPG 
and sauces and condiments. Meanwhile, prices of 
other goods and services in the core inflation 
index basket continued to stabilize in tandem with  
production cost and the slowdown in domestic 
demand.  
Prices of energy acceler ated from the 
previous quarter due to the increase in electrical 
fees (FT) of 10 satang per unit during May to 
August 2014 together with higher retail oil prices 
which edged up in line with the global oil price that 
was affected by concern over  a supply sh ortage  
that resulted from  political tensions in Libya and 
Ukraine.  
Prices of raw food slowed down from the 
previous quarter due to last year’s high bases of 
vegetable and fruit prices. Such base effect was 
large enough to offset the increase in prices of raw 
food during the first two months of 2014 Q2 
including prices of vegetables and fruits, meat and 
eggs which edged higher due to supply shortage s 
resulting from extremely hot weather .

was no signs of further pass -through to other 
goods and services. The absence of further pass -
through was, in part due to low demand pressure 
and inflation expectation. Cost pressure remained 
stable close to the current level.  
(1) Cost pressure would likely remain 
stable in line with developments in global oil and 
non-oil commodity prices together with the 
government’s policy to cap domestic diesel price 
at 30 baht per liter4/ and postpone the increase in 
LPG price for the household sector that was 
formerly scheduled to begin in June 2014 in order 
to await details of the national energy price reform 
initiative. (It was previously planned that LPG price 
for households would increase by 50 satang per 
month until the target price of 24.8 2 baht per 
kilogram would be reached in September 2014) 
Nonetheless, it was expected that cost pressure 
that stemmed from previous increases in LPG 
price would still gradually pass -through to prices of 
prepared food in the next periods.  
(2) Demand pressure  continued to be low 
as reflected by the output gap which was expected 
to remain open for the rest of the year. Nevertheless,  
the demand pressure  tend to increase  following 
the pickup in economic outlook that owed to  
improvement in the political situation  and greater 
clarity on government policies, which helped 
restore private confidence.

from 29.99 to 29.85 baht per liter, effective from June 
13, 2014 onwards.  Monetary Policy Report  June 2014                       45 (3) Inflation expectation began to stabilize 
after some declines in previous periods. In April, 
businesses’   -month -ahead inflation expectation 
stood at 3.0 percent. (Chart 2.20)   
Concerning the short -term outlook  of 
inflation , it was expected that headline inflation 
would edge up in line with core inflation due to the 
continuous pass -through of costs to prices of 
prepared food. This development would partly 
reflect ac tual behavior of restaurants in adjusting 
menu prices in line with peers, thereby resulting in 
high persistence in prepared food inflation. 
However, increase s in prices of prepared food 
were  expected to gradually slow down since most 
restaurants had alread y adjusted prices up. 
Meanwhile, increase s in prices of other goods and 
services were  expected to be modest given low 
demand pressure and stable cost pressure.

2012 2012 2013 2013 201446 Monetary Policy Report  June 2014  Recent changes  in global trade structure  
During the first four months of 2014 , Asian exports began to recover in line with 
recovery in domestic demand of major industrialized economies. The return of exports as 
driver of growth for Asian economies led to buoyant growth in many economies despite some 
slowdown in domestic demand. However, recent global economic crises and development of 
the global economy are expected to affect global trade  structure such that Asian economies 
may no longer be able to depend on exports as a source of growth as was the case in 
previous periods. This trend rests upon two key observations.   
1. Moderation in global trade 
growth  may result in lower growth of Asian 
exports in the next periods. Analysis  of 
historical  global trade data reveals that 
global trade grew by 7 percent during 
1991–2007 compared with only 4 percent 
during 2011 –2013. (Chart 1)  The observed  
reduction in globa l trade may be due to:   
 (1.1) Slow recovery of advanced  
economies:  the recovery  in the post 2008 
global economic crisis period has been slower compared to the pace noted in previous crises. 
(Chart 2)  This trend  is a result of various structural problems in the G3 economies during the 
latest global economic  crisis, namely financial, fiscal and real estate problems , as well as the 
persistently high unemployment. Resolution of these structural impediments to growth would 
take time.

End of crisisChart 2 Post-crisis recoveries of 
major industrialized economies
Index (End of crisis = 100)Monetary Policy Report  June 2014   47   (1.2)  Relocations of upstream production bases to Emerging Markets (EMs)  
for domestic -oriented and export -oriented manufacturing  have been common . This trend is 
evident from the continuous increase in Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) to EMs, both ASEAN 
and Latin America, over the last ten years. (Chart 3)  Manufacturing clusters become more 
common in each destination, covering upstream, midstream  and downstream  production s. 
Thus , imports and exports of intermediate goods have been reduced , leading to a decline in 
intra-regional trade  which has been replaced  by domestic production.   
2. Weakened relationship between G3 GDP and imports from Asia since the pre 2008 
global economic crisis period.  (Chart 4)  This development reflects that though recovery of G3 
economies is expected in the next periods, imports  from Asia may still expand only modestly. 
Hence, Asian exports may not benefit from G3 economic recovery by as much as in the past. 
This is in part due to behavioral adjustment by some G3 consumers to purchase domestically 
produced goods. Thus, some busin esses have relocated back into G3, resulting in a decrease 
in the ratio of imports to consumption of durable goods in the U.S after the 2008 global 
economic crisis. (Chart 5)  The narrowing gap between labor costs in G3 and Asia is another 
contributing fact or to this development. While  G3 unit labor cost has been declining 
continuously , particularly  after the  global economic crisis , EM unit labor cost has been 
accelerating quite notably.  
 
    
 
 
 
 
 
In summary, recent changes in global trade structure may imply that Asian exports will 
not benefit from G3 economic recovery by as much as in the past. Moreover, shifts in 
consumer behavior, for example, preference for smart phones and tablets over persona l 
computers, may also cause exports of some countries which produce obsolete goods to 
recover slower than others. Thus, countries that are affected by this shift in consumer 
behavior must upgrade their production technology to meet the changing global dema nd in 
order to maximize the benefit from G3 economic recovery.

3.1 Financial markets   
Money market interest rates remained 
stable in line with the policy rate. Government 
bond yields adjusted downwards overall in tandem 
with yields on U.S. treasuries and higher demand 
for Thai bonds by both domestic and foreign 
investors.  
Money and bond markets  
Short -term money market interest rates 
remained stable , close to the policy rate , and  in 
line with the MPC’s decision to maintain the policy 
rate at 2.00 percent per annum at the April 23, Thailand’s overall economic and financial stability continued to be well 
maintained. Money market interest rates remained stable in line with the policy 
rate. Growth in deposits and credits slowed down in tandem with the economy. 
Nonetheless, financial strength of financial institutio ns remained sound. However, 
non-financial institution sectors became more fragile due to the weakenening 
economic prospect as reflected by lower househol d income and corporate 
profitability. Thankfully, Thailand’s strong econommic fundamentals and greater 
clarity on government policies helped maintain  investor confidence along with 
stable developments in the financial and equity markets.  
Salient risks that  needed to be monitored in the periods ahead included  
1) the economic slowdown which could affect household income and corporate 
profitability and in turn, financial institutions’ credit quality;  2) clarity on political 
development, economic policies and  national reforms which could impact 
confidence, investment and private consumption in the next periods; and  
3) volatility in capital flows resulting from uncertainties on monetary policy 
directions of major industrialized economies and the still fragile global economic 
outlook, which could affect liquidity, asset prices and the foreign exchange market  
at some points.  50    Monetary Policy Report  June 2014   2014 meeting. As of June 18, 2014, the overnight 
interbank lending rate and the one -month 
government bond yield stood at 1 .90 and 2.03 
percetn per annum, respectively. (Chart 3.1)  The 
yield curve flattened since the end of March 2014. 
While short -term government bond yields remained 
stable, medium - to long -term government  bond 
yields adjusted downwards overall in tandem with 
yields of U.S. treasuries and limited new auctions 
during the second quarter.  Nonetheless, towards 
the end of May 2014, the yield curve w as dictated 
by 1) profit -making selloffs by both domestic and 
foreign investors after a significant drop in yields   
in prior periods; 2)  large supplies of medium -  
to long-term corporate debentures  and; 3) better 
economic assessment by market analysts after 
the political tension eased. As of June 18, 2014, 
the ten -year government bond yield stood at 3. 81 
percent per annum.  (Charts 3.2 and 3.3)  
Equity market  
From 2014 Q1 to May, the Stock Exchange  
of Thailand  (SET) index  edged up despite some 
short-term impact from  the new political  development  
on May 22, 2014. During the first quarter, foreign 
investors’ net sales amounted to 20.8 billion baht 
owing to  both domestic and external factors, 
namely the political uncertainty  and expectation of 
further QE T apering by the Fed after improvement 
in U.S.  economic data. As a result, the SET index 
fell to its lowest level of 1,274 points in January 
2014. However, foreign investors’ net sales 
declined rather significantly compared to the end 
of last year thanks to gradual implementation of 
QE Tapering togeth er with market price -in and 
large selloffs in previous periods. Furthermore, 
given the continuous demand from domestic 
investors, the SET index thus trended up steadily.

development  on May 22, 2014, foreign investors 
began to sell off assets again. However, the sales 
were temporary thanks to greater clarity on 
government policies including accelerated budget 
disbursement and investment project approvals by 
the Board of Investment (BOI) which helped 
restore domestic investor confidence. Subsequently,  
the SET index moved up to register at higher than 
1,400 points again on May 28, 2014. Foreign 
investor confidence also improved and asset 
purchases resumed in June onwards.  
Foreign exchange market  
Movement of the Thai baht was stable 
against the U.S. dollar. Despite some short -term 
depreciation owing to the new political development  
on May 22, 2014, the Thai baht quickly strengthened  
against the U.S. dollar at the beginning of June 
2014. (Chart 3.5)  
In recent periods, the Thai baht was rather 
stable despite some short -term depreciation due 
to investors’ concern over the protracted political 
situation coupled with better -than-expected  U.S. 
economic data which prompted investors’ anticipation  
of the normalization in U.S. monetary policy.  
After the new political development in May 
2014, some investors reduced the share of Thai 
assets in their portfolios to cut down  investment 
risk and await greater political clarity. However, 
the size of asset selloffs was small, especially 
compared to May 2013 when investors started to 
speculate on the beginning of QE Tapering by the 
Fed. (Chart 3.6)  Nonetheless, from June onwards,  
foreign investors began to return to the Thai equity 
and bond markets as confidence  on economic 
fundamentals remained strong  as reflected by

strong  financial institutions and corporates.  The 
high level of investor confidence was evident by 
credit rating agencies’ decisions to maintain 
Thailand’s credit rating, citing that clarity on 
political development would benefit the country in 
the periods ahead. On  June 17, 2014, the Thai 
baht thus stood at 32.45 baht per U.S. dollar, 
appreciating by 1.3 percent from the end of last year.  
(Chart 3.7)  
In May, the Nominal Effective Exchange 
Rate  (NEER) registered at 102.22, depreciating  by 
1 percent  from the previous month due mainly to 
movement of the Thai baht against the U.S. dollar, 
the Chinese yuan, and the Japanese yen. Factors 
that contributed to the strengthening of the 
Chinese  yuan were better -than-expected industrial 
output and balance of t rade data. Furthermore, the 
Japanese  yen appreciated owing to investors’ 
return to safe haven assets during the period  
of high political uncertainties in the Ukraine. 
Meanwhile, the Real Effective Exchange Rate 
(REER) recorded at 102.43 in April, depreciat ing 
slightly by 0.05 percent from the previous month in 
line with the trend of NEER. Overall, the REER 
continued to be lower than the NEER due to 
Thailand’s low inflation relative to trading partners’.

From April to May 2014, deposit and loan 
rates of the four largest commercial banks 
remained unchanged from 2014 Q1 . Private 
credits slowed down continuously in line with the 
economy, leading to lower intensity of competition 
for deposits.  
Interest rates, credits and deposits   
Small and medium commercial banks 
decreased deposit rates , follow ing one after 
another since April 2014 as competition  for deposits 
eased due to the slowdown in new private credits 
in line with the economy. Average d eposit rates of 
the four largest commercial banks1/, however, 
remained stable  owing to prior decreases during 
the first quarter of the year. Interest rates on the 
12-month deposits of the four largest commercial 
banks and small and medium commercial banks 
registered at 1.73 and 2.26 percent per annum, 
declinding from 1.74 and 2.35 percent per annum 
in March.  
Meanwhile, the average MLR of the four 
largest commercial banks at the end of May 2014 
stood at 6.75 percent per annum, remained 
unchange from the end of 2014 Q1.  
In 201 4 Q1, growth in other depository 
corporations’ private credits continued  to decelerate. 
At the end of April, private credit expanded by 8.6 
percent from the same period last year, slowing 
down from 10.0 percent noted at the end of 2013 . 
(Chart 3.9)  The slo wdown  in private credits was 
attrributed to  easing demand pressure associated

investment resulting from the political situation and 
high economic uncertainty. Moreover, financi al 
institutions continued to be cau tious in credit 
extension due to concerns over credit quality.  
In this connection, the BOT’s Senior Loan Officer 
survey conducted in 2014 Q1 revealed that credit 
demand would continue to trend down in the  next 
periods. Despite higher demand for some types of 
credits such as SME credit and real estate credit, 
tightened credit standards would still prevail.  
Other depository corporations’ d eposits and 
bills of exchange (B/E) continued to moderate in 
2014 Q1 . At the end of April 2014, deposits and 
B/E expanded by 5.6 percent, slowing down from 
7.6 percent recorded at the end of last year, due 
to both consumer and corporate credits. (Chart 
3.10)  The main factor that contributed to the 
slowdown in deposits and B/E was  reduction in  the 
need to mobilize deposits as financial institutions 
revised down their credit  targets. Moreover, 
depositors also reallocate d deposits to other types 
of savings produ cts with higher returns, for example,  
mutual funds. The intensity of overall competiton 
for deposits dropped. Nonetheless, financial 
institutions  still marketed some long -term deposit 
products , in part to maintain customer base. 
Overall, the Loan to Deposi t and B/E ratio edged 
higher from 96.6 in December 2013 to 96.7  
in April 2014. (Chart 3.11)

in provisioning for loss and doubtful loans.  
Commercial banks continued to pose 
strong profitably in 2014 Q1. Though operating 
profit declined slightly due to net interest income 
which de creased in line with the downward trend 
of interest rates and the slowdown in private 
credits, reduction in provisioning for loss and 
doubtful loans which followed a period of 
significant increases, led to a small rise in net 
profit from 49.3 billion baht at the end of last 
quarter to 50.5 billion baht this quarter. (Table 3.1)  
Stability of financial institutions remained 
sound overall. The capital adequacy ratio 
continued to be high at 15.5 percent despite a 
marginal decline from 15.7 percent at the end of 
last quarter. However, despite high overall credit 
quality as reflected b y the NPL ratio of 2.4 
percent, signs of deterioration were present for 
some groups namely auto leasing, credit card, and 
other personal loans. In this connection, the 
delinquency and NPL ratio of consumer loans 
climbed from 5.4 percent at the end of 2013 Q3 to 
5.8 percent at the end of 2014 Q1. (Chart 3.12)  
Nonetheless, commercial banks already 
stepped up their provisioning for loss and doubtful 
loans to prepare for upcoming economic 
uncertainties.  In this regard, the ratio of actual 
loan loss provision to  regulatory loan loss 
provision continued the upward trend to register at 
169.8 at the end of 2014 Q1.  
 
 56    Monetary Policy Report  June 2014   3.3 Non-financial sectors  
Stability of non -financial sectors was 
subject ed to greater fragility  resulting from the 
econommic slowdown. Such outlook was reflected 
by deterioration in household income and corporate  
profitabiity. Activities in the real estate sector were 
also limited. However, the impact was well contained  
and not yet systemic. Importan t risks to be 
monitored in the periods ahead included clarity on 
political development and government policies 
which could affect confidence,  private investment 
and consumption.  
Household  sector   
The economic slowdown subject ed 
households  to greater fragility as reflected by 
deterioration in income and debt servicing ability. 
However, household debt remained on a decelerating  
trend thereby  reducing some concerns over 
reoccurrence of indebtedness . 
Overall employment conditions w ere strong  
where the unemployment rate in 2014 Q1 remained  
low at 0.9 percent. Nonetheless, household income  
declined due to the decrease in farm income in 
line with contractions in prices of major crops 
including rice and rubber. Moreover, the number 
of O/T (> 50 hours of work per week) workers in 
the non -farm sector also declined in this quarter. 
(Charts 3.13 and 3.14)  The decline in household 
income could affect debt  servicing ability , 
especially for households in the low -income group 
with higher debt se rvice burdens compared to 
other groups. Thus, households were subjected to 
greater fragility during the periods of economic 
slowdown. In this regard, signs of deterioration in 
credit quality already began to show whereby the

2013 delinquency and NPL ratio of co nsumer loans 
edged up slightly from 5.7 percent at the end of 
2013 to 5.8 percent at the end of 2014 Q1. Most of 
the increase in the delin quency and NPL ratio was 
mainly attributed to deterioration in auto leasing 
and other personal loans. (Table 3.1)  
However, growth in household debt , as 
reflected by financial institutions’ consumer credits , 
continued to decelerate from 14.1 percent at the 
end of 2013 Q3 to 11.4 percent at the end of the 
2013 . (Chart 3.15)  The slowdown  in household 
debt could be explai ned by 1  households’ more 
cautious behavior towards spending and borrowing;  
and 2  financial institutions’ tightening of credit 
standards for households. Subsequently, concerns 
over reoccurrence of household indebtedness eased 
somewhat.  Moreover, househol d liquidity remained 
stable overall as reflected by the ratio of  households’  
financial assets to household debt which continued  
to be at 2 at the end of 2013 . (Chart 3.16)  This 
level of liquidity was judged adequate to absorb  
short -term risks stemming from the economic 
slowdown.   
Looking ahead, development of the Thai 
economy  in the period of  greater political clarity 
must  still be monitored as it would directly affect 
future income and debt servicing ability of 
households alo ng with confidence and private 
consumption . 
Corporate sector  
The economic slowdown and dampened 
consumer confidence led to a continuous decline 
in corporate profitability. However, debt servicing

in 2014 Q1. (Chart 3.17)  The decrease in corporate  
profitability owe d mainly to declining sales in 
tandem with the slowdown  in the economy. 
However, debt servicing ability and liquidity was 
well maintained where the Interest Coverage Ratio 
(ICR)  continued to increase from 5.6 in 2013 Q4  to 
6.2 in 2014 Q1 , in part as a result of the downward 
trend of interest rates. (Chart 3.18)  Meanwhile, 
the Current Ratio (CR) adjusted upwards  overall 
and indebtedness , as reflected by the Debt to 
Equity (D/E) ratio , stabilized at 0.8.  
However, SMEs were rather signific antly 
impacted by the economic slowdown whereby 
affected sectors included tourism -related sectors 
and construction sector which was subjected to 
delays in many government projects. Given that  
commercial banks promptly stepped in to help 
customers who had h igh business potential but 
were affected by short -term risks, overall credit 
quality did not worsen by much.  (Chart 3.12)  
Moreover, it was expected that resolution 
of the political situation coupled with continuity in 
government operations and greater clarity on 
stimulus plans would help shore up private sector 
confidence and improve corporate stability in the 
periods ahead.  
Real estate sector  
Real estate activities in Bangkok and its 
vicinities slowed down in line with economic and 
political developmen ts as all concerned parties 
adjusted for potential risks. Nonetheless, future 
economic outlook remained to be closely monitored  
as it could affect households’ purchasing power.

‘000 unitsSince  December 2013 onwards, the real 
estate sector began to slowdown after ha ving 
accelerated notably in the middle of the year. 
Moreover, there were various negative factors 
affecting the sector including the economic 
slowdown and  the elevated household debt which 
resulted in lower households’ purchasing power. 
In addition, uncert ain and delayed investment in 
the government’s large infrastructural  projects  also 
dampened consumer confidence. Together, a ll 
these factors led to postponement of purchasing 
decisions and subsequently demand for real 
estate. I n this connection, unit reser vation rate  
in April 2014 stood at 17 percent, moderating 
steadily from 37 percent in November 2013, 
reflecting a significant slowdown in the real estate 
market.  
The increase in risks caused buyers, 
developers and financial institutions to make 
necessary adjustments. Buyers became more 
cautious in their spending and developers 
postponed new launches , especially in case of 
condominium . In this regard, the number of new 
launches during the first four months of 2014 
contracted by 39.3 percent from the same period 
last year. (Chart 3 .19) Furthermore, some developers  
also adjusted by  choosing to launch smaller 
projects to help stimulate sales and expedite 
construction and delivery of  units in order to 
manage liquidity. Promotions were also introduced 
for previously launched projects including the zero 
transfer fee option to boost demand.  
In April 2014,  the Debt Service Coverage 
Ratio  (DSCR ) of buyers stood at 4.6, declining 
marginally  from 4.8 in December 2013.  (Chart

Stability of the real estate sector was 
dented overall though it remained able to absorb 
upcoming risks.   Such risk absorption ability could 
be reflected by satisfactory credit quality for both 
pre-finance and post -finance credits.  
Fiscal sector  
Stabilit y of the fiscal sector continued to be 
sound though the ratio of public debt to GDP 
edged up slightly from the end of 2013 Q4. Looking 
ahead, however, the sector  was subjected to risks 
from the structural imbalance between revenue 
and expenditure. It was expec ted that the situation 
could improve given tangible fiscal reform efforts, 
particularly to address structural impediments in 
order to promote fiscal stability and sustainability 
in the long -term.  
Stability of the fiscal sector continued to be 
sound though  the ratio of public debt to GDP 
edged up slightly from 45.7 percent in 2013 Q4 to 
46.6 percent in April 2013. (Chart 3.22)  The 
increase in public debt was due mainly to debt 
accumulation to  finance the budget deficit. 
Moreover, additional borrowings to fund the rice 
pledging scheme would also take public  debt 
slightly higher in June. However, it was expected 
that concerns over stability of the fiscal sector 
would ease somewhat thanks to the abolition of 
some quasi -fiscal programs such as the rice 
pledging scheme.  
However, stability of the fiscal sector in the 
long-term was still subjected to the structural 
imbalance between revenue and expenditure. 
While government revenue  continued to trend 
downwards owing to  various tax measures,
