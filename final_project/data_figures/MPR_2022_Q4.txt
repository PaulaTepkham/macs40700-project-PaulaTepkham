Executive SummaryExecutive Summary
6/60Assessment of the Economic and Inflation Outlook
Risks to the growth outlook is balanced but there remains the need to monitor the global 
economic recovery, which is still subject to uncertainties and could slow down more than expected, 
as well as the traction of tourism recovery. 
Inflation
Headline inflation is expected to average 6.3% in 2022, 3.0% in 2023, and 2.1% in 2024. 
Headline inflation has receded from its peak in the third quarter of 2022 and is expected to 
fall within the target range by end -2023. However, headline inflation forecast for 2023 is revised up 
from the previous assessment due to the increase in electricity charges as input costs remain high. 
Core inflation forecast is largely unchanged from the previous assessment. Core inflation is 
expected to gradually decline and average 2.6% in 2022, 2.5% in 2023, and 2.0% in 2024. Prices of 
goods in the core category have either remained stable or declined due to lower cost pass -through 
compared to the earlier parts of the year thanks to declining global energy and commodity prices. 
Medium -term inflation expectations remain well -anchored within the target range. 
Risks to the inflation forecast is balanced. However, there remain risks to be closely 
monitored namely (1) higher -and faster -than-expected cost pass -through from producers including 
electricity charges, which remain uncertain; (2) slower -than-expected global economic growth that 
could result in further declines in energy and commodity prices; and (3) uncertainties pertaining to 
government relief measures such as subsidies for electricity charges and other living costs. Global Economy
Trading partners are expected to grow 2.9% in 2022, 2.5% in 2023, and 3.1% in 2024. 
Growth is expected to slow down in 2023 due to global demand being impacted by (1) high inflation; 
(2) tighter global financial conditions as a result of monetary tightening in many countries; and (3) 
China’s economic slowdown as a result of the government’s Zero -COVID policy to contain the 
recent outbreak, and problems in the Chinese property market. Trading partners are expected to see 
stronger growth in 2024 as the impact of inflation of consumption gradually dissipates and financial 
conditions become less tight.  
The Thai Economy
The Thai economy is expected to continue recovering and register growth rates of 3.2% 
in 2022, 3.7% in 2023, and 3.9% in 2024. The recovery would be driven by (1) stronger recovery 
in tourism as reflected in the continued increase in foreign tourist arrivals and improvements in 
tourism rapid indicators. Foreign tourist arrival is expected to reach 10.5 million persons in 2022 and 
22 million persons in 2023, an upward revision of one million persons for each year from the 
previous forecast. It is also expected that foreign tourist arrivals would continue to increase and 
reach 31.5 million persons in 2024. Most foreign tourists would come from ASEAN and Asian 
countries, while foreign tourists from China would likely be relatively low in 2023 as China’s border 
reopening plan is still highly uncertain; and (2) continued recovery in private consumption supported by 
recovery in economic activities, especially services, and more broad -based improvements in employment 
and labor income. While the global economic slowdown would impact merchandise exports,
especially goods that are sensitive to trading partners’ growth outlook such as automobile, textiles, 
electronical appliances, and industrial goods. Meanwhile, exports of some other goods such as 
agriculture and agro -industry would still see positive growth . Overall, tourism and private 
consumption would be the key drivers of growth and help offset the impact from the global 
economic slowdown. Executive Summary
7/60Financial Conditions and Financial Stability
Overall financial conditions in Thailand remain accommodative. Commercial 
bank interest rates and short -term bond yields have increased gradually in line with the 
policy rate path. Long -term bond yields have declined in line with US Treasury yields 
due to expectations that the Fed might slow down the pace of its rate hikes. In terms of 
quantity, credit provision and bond issuance are still growing and is expected to continue 
growing with the economic recovery. On exchange rates, the baht against U.S. dollar 
experienced volatile movements as a result of the Fed’s monetary policy direction. 
Nevertheless, the baht saw sharp appreciation in November 2022 due to market 
expectations that the Fed to slow down its policy rate hike as inflation started to 
subside, and China’s announcement of plans to relax its international travel restrictions . 
Overall, the tighter and more volatile global financial conditions had a limited 
impact on domestic financial conditions in Thailand due to low levels of external 
debt in business sectors and that the majority of firms have exchange rate risk management
in place. 
Financial stability remains sound overall. Commercial banks’ capital and loan 
loss provision remain high. Debt serviceability of businesses and households has 
improved in line with the economy recovery. However, some SMEs and households 
whose income have yet to fully recovery are still sensitive to rising living costs and debt 
burden. The MPC assesses that an aggressive policy rate hike could negatively impact the 
recovery of those vulnerable groups . Monetary policy should thus be normalized in a 
gradual and measured manner, and complemented by the continued implementation of 
debt restructuring measures. Monetary Policy Decisions in the Fourth Quarter of 2022
At the meeting on 30 November 2022, the MPC voted unanimously to raise 
the policy rate by 0.25 percentage point from 1.00% to 1.25%. Thailand’s 
economic recovery continues to gain traction on the back of tourism and private 
consumption, the recovery of which could offset the impact of global economic 
slowdown. Headline inflation in 2023 is revised up from the previous assessment but is 
expected to fall within the target range in the latter half of 2023. The MPC judges t hat 
a gradual and measured approach to monetary policy normalization is still appropriate 
given the current economic recovery path and inflation outlook 
Under the monetary policy framework with objectives of maintaining price 
stability, supporting sustainable and full -potential economic growth, and preserving 
financial stability, the MPC assesses that the Thai economy will continue to recover but 
there are risks to the inflation outlook to be monitored . Hence the MPC judges that 
the policy rate should be normalized in a gradual and measured manner to a 
level that is consistent with sustainable growth in the long term. Given heightened 
uncertainties in the global economy, the MPC is ready to adjust the size and 
timing of policy normalization should the growth and inflation outlook shifts from 
the current assessment.≡

The manufacturing sector showed signs of slowing down in tandem with falling global demand. Persistently high inflation and continuation
of monetary policy tightening by many central banks would further impact consumer purchasing power, business input costs, and private sector 
confidence. And this could be a threat for private consumption growth momentum despite the recently strong recovery we have seen 
in advanced and Asian economies due to recovery in service sectors. Global Economy
Inflation is declining in tandem with falling global energy and commodity prices as a result of the slowdown in global demand. However, 
inflation expectations in major advanced economies would still be above target next year. Inflation in the US remains high due to the 
ongoing economic recovery and tight labor market conditions. Meanwhile, inflation in the UK and euro area would see additiona l energy price 
pressures as Russia has ceased its exports of natural gas to Europe. 11/60Energy and Commodity Prices

The Fed continues to tighten monetary policy, signaling that it 
would hike rates further and over a longer period than expected in 
the previous Monetary Policy Report . Given that inflation in the US 
might remain high and be more persistent than expected, the Fed might 
have to raise its policy rate more aggressively in 2023 than previously 
expected to 5.00 -5.25% before gradually normalizing the policy rate in 
the latter half of 2024. 
The European Central Bank (ECB) raised its policy rate in response to 
mounting inflationary pressure. The ECB raised its policy rate by 75 bps to 1.50% 
at the meeting on 27 October 2022. It is still expected that the ECB would 
continue to raise rates despite having adopted a more dovish stance by 
emphasizing that the rate hikes will be data -dependent and decided on a 
meeting -by-meeting basis. Financial markets expect the ECB to raise its policy rate 
by another 50 bps in December 2022.
Most Asian central banks continued to raise their policy rates following the 
aggressive rate hikes by major central banks. This was also due to the ongoing 
economic recovery and rising inflation in many countries as a result of rising food 
and energy prices. These include rate hikes1/by countries such as South Korea 
(+2.50%), Philippines (+3.0% ), Indonesia(+1.25%), and Malaysia (+1.0%)

Global Economy
The manufacturing and exports sectors in China are affected by the Zero -COVID policy, problems in the real estate sector, and th e 
slowdown in global demand. The implementation of Zero -COVID policy to contain the recent COVID -19 outbreak in China has impeded economic 
activities and affected consumer confidence. Prolonged problems in the real estate sector have resulted in a continued declin e in property 
demand. While the PBOC’s rate cut having limited effect in helping shore up real estate sector, the effect of measures to sti mulate property 
demand is expected to become more apparent in 2023. 13/60China’s Manufacturing Purchasing Manager Index: PMI

previous assessment.  The US and euro area registered stronger -than-expected 
economic growth in the third quarter, while the Chinese economy was impacted 
by both the slowdown in global demand and subdued domestic demand as a 
result of new COVID -19 containment measures and prolonged problems in the real

Trading partners’ growth forecast for 2023 is revised down as global demand is 
expected to be affected by persistently high inflation and continuation of 
monetary policy tightening by central banks around the world. 
Trading partners’ growth is expected to pick up in 2024. The expansion of 
economic activity is expected to resume once the inflation pressure weighing on 
consumption spending dissipates and financial conditions become less tighten. While trading partners’ growth outlook for 2022 is largely unchanged from the previous assessment, it is expected 
to slow down in 2023 due to global demand being affected by tight global financial conditions and high inflation. Global Economy
15/60Tightening global financial conditions have exacerbated vulnerabilities in the financial system that could impact trading 
partners’ growth such as problems in the Chinese and South Korean real estate sectors, debt defaults in emerging market 
economies like Sri Lanka, and the deteriorating financial positions of businesses and households caused by the COVID -19 pandemic
Global trade slowed down more than expected due to (1) a slowdown in global demand as a result of high and persistent 
inflation; (2) China’s Zero -COVID policy creating disruptions in both the manufacturing and services sectors; and (3) shortages of raw 
materials and logistics problems due to the global supply disruption that has lasted longer than expected
Geopolitical tensions, including rising tensions between the US and China after the ban on high -tech goods exports to China (tech 
war), as well as the Russia -Ukraine and China -Taiwan conflicts that could be prolonged and escalate further. The materialization of 
these risks would impact the global supply chain and exacerbate the ongoing chip shortage and rising commodity prices.
Downside risks
Upside risks

19/60Foreign tourist arrivalsRevised up from 9.5 million to 10.5 million persons in 2022 on account of outturns and rapid indicators that continue to turn 
up higher than expected. Foreign tourist arrivals are expected to continue recovering in 2023 and 2024 , reaching 22 
million persons in 2023 and 31.5 million persons in 2024. The recovery would be driven by the continued recovery in global 
tourism demand and international flight capacity. It is expected the global economic slowdown would have a limited impact 
on tourism. 
Private consumptionRevised up on account of the economic recovery, especially the services sector, as well as more broad -based improvements in 
employment and labor income, although headwinds from high living costs remain. Private consumption is expected to continue 
expanding in 2023 and 2024 on the back of a continued recovery in labor income, and higher household purchasing power as 
inflation declines. 
Merchandise exports (Value)Revised down mainly on account of lower export quantity, especially goods that are sensitive to trading partners’ economic 
outlook such as automobiles, textiles, electronic appliances, and industrial goods. Idiosyncratic factors also affect exports of
goods such as electronics, which are affected by changes in consumer behavior, and petroleum and petrochemical products, 
which are affected by maintenance shutdowns of oil refineries in Q4/2022. Nevertheless, some product categories see 
demand improvements such as agricultural and argo -manufacturing products. Strong export growth is expected in 2024 in 
line with trading partners’ economic outlook. 
Private investmentRevised up on account of Q3/2022 outturns as well as the recovery in domestic demand and tourism. However, there remain 
headwinds from potential slowdowns in merchandise exports. Overview of economic forecasts

account of outturns and rapid indicators that reflect a stronger -than-expected

related to flight availability and labor shortages in the tourism sector are 
expected to be resolved and would not impede the recovery. Reimpositions 
of international travel restrictions by foreign countries are not likely, except 
for China where its border reopening plan remains uncertain. Thus it is 
expected that Chinese tourist arrivals would resume much later, around 
end-2023.

Source: The Customs Department, Ministry of Commerce, BOT calculationsMerchandise exports is expected to slow down in 2023 due to the slowdown in global demand. 
•The value of merchandise exports in 2022 is revised down on account 
of outturns in the third quarter. This is mainly on account of lower exports
quantity from (1) the global economic slowdown; and (2) dissipations of 
temporary factors supporting Thai exports as India and Indonesia have lifted 
their restrictions on exports of sugar and palm oil, respectively. 
•The value of merchandise exports is expected to slow down in 2023 
and 2024 on account of lower export quantity, especially goods that are 
sensitive to trading partners’ economic outlook such as automobiles, textiles , 
electronic appliances, and industrial goods. Nevertheless, exports of goods 
such as agricultural and argo -manufacturing products are still expected to 
pick up further.The Thai Economy

Core inflation in October 2022 was recorded at 3.17%, up from 3.08%

food prices which have increased in tandem with input costs. 
Meanwhile, prices in the non -food categories also increased, namely, 
prices of personal care products, and cleaning supplies.Headline inflation in October 2022 was recorded at 5.98%, down 
from 7.28% in the previous quarter. Energy prices have declined as 
a result of the base effect of high oil prices in the previous year, as 
well as the decline in retail gasoline prices in tandem with global 
crude oil prices. Meanwhile, fresh food inflation has increased namely 
rice, wheat products, eggs, and dairy products, due to high input costs.Headline inflation have receded from its peak in Q3/2022. Headline inflation in October 2022 declined from the 
previous quarter as domestic energy prices continued to decline in tandem with global oil prices. The Thai Economy

•Recent depreciation of the baht had a limited impact on inflation 
given the low import content in the CPI basket. While the key channel for 
exchange rate pass -through to Thai inflation is through imported fuel, the 
impact of which was partly offset by the government’s measures through 
the Oil Fuel Fund. The limited pass -through is also because, in Thailand, 
only a small fraction of fresh foods are imported.The Thai Economy

•Dubai crude oil prices would be lower throughout the forecast horizon 
given recent price outturns and the global economic slowdown. 
•Farm income (excluding government support measures) would see

( )previous forecast in the Monetary Policy Report Sep 2022
Source: BOT forecastAssumption for Dubai crude oil prices
Dubai crude oil prices are expected to be lower due to a shaper -than-expected global economic slowdown.
Dubai crude oil price forecasts are revised down from 102 to 100 U.S. dollar 
per barrel in 2022, and from 98 to 95 U.S. dollar per barrel in 2023 due to:
•The global economy would slow down more than expected resulting in 
lower demand for crude oil. 
•Demand switching (from gas to oil) would slow down due to declining 
natural gas prices, and warmer -than-expected winter in Europe.
Dubai crude oil prices would decline in 2024 due to higher oil output from non -
OPEC producers and higher Russian oil exports after trade reroute to mitigate the 
impact of sanctions.
Risks to Dubai crude oil prices are still balanced. 
•Upside risks: The Russia -Ukraine conflict could escalate, spread to other 
regions, and become more prolonged than expected; OPEC+ could further cut 
oil production in the future. 
•Downside risks: Sharper -than-expected slowdown in global growth or 
another wave of COVID -19 outbreak could further exacerbate oil demand. ≡

Short-term bond yields have moved in line with the policy rate adjustment path. Meanwhile, long -term yields declined in tandem w ith U.S. 
Treasury yields as investors expect the Fed to slow down the pace of its rate hikes after inflation has started to subside in the US. At the same time, 
foreign investors have invested more in long -term bonds in Thailand in November. Credit spreads for bonds with less than 3 years to maturity with 
credit ratings higher than AA have increased slightly. This is partly because businesses have issued more bonds in the recent period to lock -in their 
costs during the interest rate upcycle. Meanwhile, credit spreads of other bonds have largely been stable. 34/60Basis point ร้อยละ Corporate and government bond credit spread, by credit rating Thai government bond and US Treasury yields

economic recovery. 
In Q3/2022, large corporate loans (credit limit > 500 million baht) posted strong 
growth rates despite slowing down from the previous quarter. This was largely driven 
by growing credit demand among businesses in the trade and manufacturing sectors that 
needed additional financing to keep up with the stronger economic recovery. Meanwhile, 
bond issuances has continued to increase due to businesses wanting to lock -in their 
financing costs before interest rates rise further. 
SME loans (credit limit ≤500million baht) contracted from the same period last year
mainly due to soft loans reaching maturity. 
Household credit grew across all loan types , especially credit card and other 
personal loans which picked up in tandem with the recovery in private consumption. 
Meanwhile, auto loans picked up on the back of improvements in automotive market 
conditions, and mortgage loans grew on the back of higher housing demand. 
For Q 4/20222/, it is expected that loan demand would continue to increase with 
loan demand from large corporates for investment purposes, while for SMEs, demand 
is driven by the need for working capital to keep up with the economic recovery. 
Households’ demand for loans also increased from improvements in consumers ’ 
confidence.

Appreciation
In the first 2 months of Q4/2022, the baht averaged 37.12 per U.S. dollar, depreciating by 2% from the average value in the previous quarter. The 
depreciation was driven by the Fed’s more aggressive rate hike in response to rising inflation. Nonetheless, the baht sharply appreciated in November 2022 
due to market expectations that the Fed might slow down the pace of its rate hike given subsiding inflation, prompting the ma rket to take on more risks 
(risk-on sentiment). China’s announcement of the plan to relax travel restrictions also contributed to the baht’s appreciation. The nominal effective 
exchange rate (NEER) averaged 114.49 , which is largely unchanged from the previous quarter as the baht’s depreciation was in line with the 
depreciations of trade competitors’ currencies. There is still net capital inflow into both the bond and stock markets. Capital inflows accelerated 
during the fourth quarter as a result of risk -on sentiment in the financial markets. 37/60-1.50.01.53.0

Source : BOTBox 1: Assessment of international reserves adequacy
International reserves are foreign currency -denominated cash and 
assets, including gold that are held and managed by the central bank. 
International reserves serve many purposes such as (1) backing for the 
domestic currency; (2) a backstop for external risks such as balance of payment 
crises, and capital flow reversals; or (3) managing exchange rate volatilities. 
Maintaining adequate level of international reserves as buffers for external risks is 
particularly important for emerging market economies (EMs). This is because EMs 
are typically more susceptible to multiple external vulnerabilities including 
persistent balance of payment deficits, high levels of external debts, and volatile 
capital flows, all of which could lead to financial crises as seen in the past. Thus
having adequate level of international reserves would help cushion the impact 
of external risks and foster confidence among trading partners and foreign 
investors, which helps strengthen economic and financial stability of a country.  
Reserves adequacy can be assessed from multiple dimensions. This 
includes comparing the level of reserves to board money within the country, 
comparing the level of reserves to potential foreign currency needs in the future 
(e.g.to repay external debt or to pay for imports), or stress testing to assess the 
severity of capital outflows across various channels during a crisis, etc.This box presents 3 key measurements of international reserves 
adequacy as appear in Table 1, includingFinancial conditions

Source: IMF and BOTBox 1: Assessment of international reserves adequacy
(1)Net international reserves to short -term external debt. A generally
accepted benchmark is that the ratio should be higher than 1 (Greenspan -
Guidotti Rule), which indicates that while the country may temporarily 
lack foreign currency income, they would still be able to tap into their 
international reserves to repay all their short -term external debt over the next 
1 year. Latest data shows that Thailand’s external debt to GDP ratio is 
relatively low compared to regional counterparts at 38% of GDP, of which only 
40% are short -term external debt. As such, the ratio of international reserves 
to short -term external debt is as high as 3, which is well above international 
standards and is higher than many countries in the region (Chart 1).
(2) Net international reserves to imports. A general rule of thumb is 
that this ratio should be greater than 3, which indicates that while the country 
may temporarily lack foreign currency income, they still have enough 
international reserves to pay for imports of goods and services for more than 3 
consecutive months. Latest data shows that Thailand has enough international 
reserves to cover as much as 8 months of imports of goods and services, 
which is also well above international standards. Financial conditions
41/60Box 1: Assessment of international reserves adequacy
(3) IMF’s Assessing Reserve Adequacy (ARA) Metric1/. The IMF has developed
the ARA Metric to assess the adequacy of EMs’ international reserves to cushion against 
volatility during crisis times. The ARA Metric score is calculated using data points from 
past crises faced by EMs in 4 dimensions. The general rule is that an EM should have 
international reserves 1 -1.5 times higher than the calculated score. The ARA Metric 
score calculation for Thailand assumes a floating exchange rate regime2/because 
Thailand has adopted a managed -float exchange rate regi me. The four dimensions 
included in the ARA metric are:
(3.1) Short -term external debt reflects how much foreign currency is 
needed to repay debt over the next 1 year. The IMF’s recommendation is for 
international reserves to cover at least 30% of short -term external debt. 
(3.2) Other portfolio liabilities include longer -term external debt and 
equities held by non -residents which could become capital outflows during a crisis. 
The IMF’s recommendation is for international reserves to cover at least 15% of 
other portfolio liabilities. 
(3.3) Broad money reflects the risk that the population may lose confidence 
in the domestic currency during a crisis and switch to using foreign currencies 
instead (residential outflows). The IMF’s recommendation is for international 
reserves to cover at least 5% of broad money to mitigate against those risks. (3.4) Value of exports reflects the risks that a country may lack foreign 
currency income due to export disruptions. The IMF’s recommendation is for 
international reserves to cover at least 5% of the value of exports of goods and 
services within a year. 
Taking into consideration those 4 dimensions, the calculated IMF ARA Metric 
Score for Thailand in 2022 is 108.9 billion U.S. Dollar. Thailand’s current level of 
international reserves is thus 2.1 times the calculated ARA metric (Chart 2) .
In summary , since the past decade, Thailand’s international reserves 
have been consistently higher than the benchmarks in all 3 measurements 
namely international reserves to short -term external debt (3 times), international 
reserves to imports (8 months), or the IMF’s ARA Metric (2.1 times). High levels of 
international reserves is one of the key factors underpinning Thailand’s strong 
external stability, which would help cushion the impact of financial market 
volatilities and other potential external challenges in the future.
1/ “Assessing Reserve Adequacy –Specific Proposals” Staff Report , IMF, April2015.
2/ Under the IMF’s ARA Metric, countries with a floating exchange regime would require a lower 
level of international reserves compared to countries with a fixed exchange rate regime. This is 
because the former would have less need to intervene in the foreign exchange market, and 
the flexible exchange rate itself would already serve as a shock absorber. ≡

43/60Monetary Policy Decision: Summary of Key Considerations
Monetary Policy Decision
The MPC judges that a 
gradual and measured policy 
normalization remains an 
appropriate course for 
monetary policy, whilst 
standing ready to adjust the 
size and timing in response to 
risks and uncertainties. Financial Stability
remains sound overall but 
financial positions of some 
businesses and households 
are still vulnerable given weak 
income recovery which 
renders them sensitive to 
higher living costs and rising 
debt burden. Economic growth
The Thai economic recovery 
has continued to gain 
traction. Tourism and private 
consumption will continue to 
be key economic drivers and 
help alleviate the impact of 
global slowdown.Inflation outlook
Headline inflation receded 
from its peak in Q3/2022 and 
is expected to fall within the 
target by end -2023, but there 
remain risks pertaining to a 
potential increase in cost 
pass-through.

48/60The MPC judges that it is still appropriate to pursue a gradual and measured monetary policy normalization, whilst 
standing ready to adjust the size and timing in response to risks and uncertainties. 
MPC Meeting 
No. 6/2022 
(30Nov 2022)
Given the heightened uncertainties surrounding the global economic outlook , 
the MPC stands ready to adjust the size and timing of policy normalization 
should the growth and inflation outlook shift from the current assessment. 1.25%Current policy rate:Overall financial system remains resilient. However, risks pertaining to the 
vulnerable groups remain to be monitored especially households whose 
income have yet to fully recover and thus are sensitive to higher living costs 
and rising debt burden. The MPC judges that a gradual monetary policy 
normalization complemented by continued implementation of debt restructuring 
measures would help support the recovery of the vulnerable groups. The Thai economy is expected to continue recovering on the back of 
tourism and private consumption, which would help offset the impact from 
the global economy. Headline inflation has receded from its peak and is 
expected to fall within the target range in 2023. However, there remain risks 
to be monitored, especially a potential increase in cost pass -through and 
uncertainties pertaining to domestic energy prices. The MPC voted 
unanimously to raise the 
policy rate by 0.25 
percentage point. Monetary Policy Decision

(Bangkok and Vicinity)Box 2:Housing market recovery post -COVID
The outbreak of COVID -19 since early -2020 had a broad -based impact 
on the Thai economy, including the housing market . The prolonged outbreak 
and ensuing containment measures have resulted in a decline in household 
income and residential property demand. As such, property developers either 
delayed or canceled many new projects, which is reflected in the immediate 
decline in the number of new residential properties for sale in Bangkok and vicinities.
The average figure between 2020 -2021 is 16.6 thousand units per quarter, declining by 
42% compared to the pre -COVID average (Chart 1).
More recently, the impact of COVID -19 on the housing market has 
partly been offset by adjustments on part of both the developers and 
home buyers. Developers offered sales promotions and discounts to offload 
their property inventory and maintain liquidity. This also includes high -end 
property where demand from high -income buyers was not significantly affected 
by the pandemic. Meanwhile, buyers’ preference shifted towards low -rise houses 
due to many workplaces adopting work -from-home arrangements. This is reflected in 
increases in loan approvals for low -rise houses. Overall, mortgage approval did not
decline substantially in 2020. This is partly because many transactions were already
completed before COVID -19 such as pre -purchase agreements for condominiums 
that were made one year before the construction was actually completed . Monetary Policy Decision

(Bangkok and Vicinity)Box 2: Housing market recovery post-COVID
Nevertheless, the number of new mortgages approved in 2021 fell, with condominiums 
declining as much as 23% from the previous year. This is due to weak demand, more 
stringent credit approval standards among financial institutions, and fewer announcements 
of new housing projects in the year prior.
Since end -2021 when the COVID -19 situation has improved and the government
has relaxed containment measures and rolled out measures to support the real 
estate market, economic activities and the real estate market have continued to 
gradually improve with low -rise houses being the first to recover. Examples of government 
measures to support the real estate market include (1) reducing the fee on property 
transfers and mortgages to 0.01% for residential properties valued up to 3 million baht, 
both new and second -hand (effective 18 Jan –31 Dec 20221/ ); (2) temporarily relaxing LTV 
limit (effective 20 Oct 2021 –31 Dec 2022) with aims to stimulate the economy through the 
real estate sector whereby the LTV limits for first -home mortgages for properties valued 
above 10 million baht and for second and subsequent mortgages were increased to 100%. 
In 2022, the recovery in the real estate market has been more broad -based with improvements
for both low -rise houses and condominiums. The number of new residential properties for 
sale picked up in the first half of 2022 and the number of mortgage approvals followed suit 
in the second half of 2022. As of Q3/2022, the number of new residential properties for sale and 
mortgage approvals were 24.5 thousand units and 16.7 thousand units, respectively (Chart 2), 
which are close to pre -COVID levels.

Index(2011= 100 )Box 2: Housing market recovery post -COVID
A close look at price data reveals that property prices did not decline sharply during the 
COVID -19 pandemic, and current property prices have not shown signs of accelerating to a 
point of concern. The Bank of Thailand has developed the property price index2/based on the 
database of new loans extended by commercial banks and the Government Housing Bank using the 
hedonic regression to account for determinants of prices such as location and number of floors. The 
property price index for condominiums in Q3/2021 was 166.4, declining by 4.5% from Q2/2021 when 
strict containment measures were imposed and prompted developers to offer discounts to offload 
their excess inventories since the first lockdown. Meanwhile, prices of low -rise houses were rather 
stable. More recently, property prices have gradually increased in tandem with the recovery in 
demand but did not accelerate to a point of concern. The property price index for condominiums in 
Q1-Q3/2022 averaged 182.9, growing by 1.4% from the same period in the previous year and growing 
by 9.9% from the lowest point 2 years ago (Chart 3) . 
In conclusion, the Thai real estate market was impacted by COVID -19 in 2020 but has 
continued to recover and is now close to levels seen pre -COVID. This is reflected in the mortgage 
approval numbers and the number of new residential properties for sale. Meanwhile, property prices 
did not decline sharply and have yet to show signs of accelerating to a point of concern. However, 
the housing market still faces challenges including rising construction costs due to rising oil and 
commodity prices, and elevated household debt which could weigh on household purchasing power 
in the future.
