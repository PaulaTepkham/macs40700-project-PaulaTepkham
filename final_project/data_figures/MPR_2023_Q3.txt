4/53Executive Summary
For 2024, economic growth should pick up from both domestic and external 
demand ,which would be supported by (1) a strong expansion of private consumption 
benefiting from a robust labor market recovery, notably intourism -related sectors , and 
additional stimulus from government policies; (2) thecontinuing recovery in tourism 
sector from increasing foreign tourist arrivals; and (3) the revival of merchandise exports 
in line with the recovery in global demand and an upturn in the global electronics 
cycle. The economic growth in 2024 has an upside risk from stronger -than-expected 
stimulus from government policies. Meanwhile, some downside risks remain namely a 
weaker -than-expected global economic recovery. 
Inflation
Headline inflation is expected to be within the target range, averaging at 
1.6% in 2023 and 2.6% in 2024. Headline inflation in 2023 is likely to remain low due 
to government subsidies, subdued raw food prices, and the high base effect. Meanwhile,
core inflation is expected to average 1.4% in 2023 and 2.0% in 2024. Core inflation 
in 2024 is expected to rise in tandem with stronger economic recovery, additional impetus
from the government’s economic policies, and higher food prices due to El Niño. 
Nonetheless, there remains upside risks to be monitored, especially in 2024, including
greater demand -side pressures related to government economic policies and higher 
food prices should the El Niño phenomenon intensify. (Box 2: El Niño: a risk to Thai 
economy going forward ) Global economy
Trading partners are expected to grow 2.7% in 2023 and 2.5% in 2024. The 
US economy continued to gain traction driven by growth in the services sector. 
The Chinese economy recovered slower than expected due to real estate problems, 
impacting confidence and domestic demand, as well as faltering recovery of exports. 
This would negatively impact Asian merchandise exports as a whole. However, Asian 
merchandise exports are expected to gradually recover in early 2024 on the back of a 
recovery in global goods demand, inventory rundowns, and an upturn in the global 
electronics cycle (Box1:Exports recovery in Asia) , all of which would support trading 
partners’ economic recovery in the period ahead. Nonetheless, the global economic 
outlook is still subject to risks stemming from the lagging effects of major central 
banks’ monetary policy actions, slower -than-expected recovery in global trade due to 
weak demand from China, and lingering geopolitical risks, all of which would pose 
implications for monetary policy and global economic growth in the period ahead. 
The Thai Economy
The Thai economy continues to recover with growth projected to be 2.8% 
in 2023 and 4.4% in 2024. For 2023, economic growth is revised down on account of 
slower -than-expected recovery in both merchandise exports and tourism, partly due to 
softening recovery in the Chinese economy and the global electronics cycle. Private 
consumption growth should remain strong underpinned by spending in services and 
would remain a key driver of growth for this year. 
5/53Executive Summary
Financial Conditions and Financial Stability
Overall financial conditions tightened somewhat .Private sector funding costs 
haveincreased as commercial banks’ interest rates rose in tandem with the policy 
rate. Long -term government bond yields rose in line with US Treasury yields due to 
market expectations that the Fed will keep policy rate higher for longer, as well as 
concerns that Thai government bond issuances could increase in the period ahead 
to finance government stimulus measures. Credit spreads remained largely unchanged
from the previous quarter. In terms of financing volume, businesses were still able 
to mobilize funds although private credit growth has slowed partly due to a 
normalization of lending activity, following the strong expansion thanks to financial 
measures during the COVID -19 pandemic. Business credit is expected to recover in 
line with the recovery in economic activities going forward. On exchange rates, the 
baht against the US dollar depreciated from the previous quarter.The baht’s 
depreciation was driven by market expectations about the Fed’s monetary policy, 
the renminbi depreciation, lower -than-expected outturns in Thai economy, and net 
capital outflows from both bond and stock markets in Q3/2023.
The overall financial system remains resilient with commercial banks 
maintaining high levels of capital and loan loss provision. However, credit quality 
must be monitored as debt serviceability of some SMEs and households could be 
affected by higher debt burden and slower income recovery. The MPC supports 
the continuation of debt restructuring measures as well as targeted measures and 
sustainable debt resolution for vulnerable groups, particularly responsible lending 
measures.Monetary Policy Decisions in the Third Quarter of 2023
At the meetings on 2 August 2023 and 27 September 2023, the MPC voted 
unanimously to raise the policy rate by 0.25 percentage points from 2.00% to 
2.25% and from 2.25% to 2.50%. The MPC deem eda continuation of gradual policy 
normalization to be appropriate in light of the growth and inflation outlook. The MPC 
assessed the overall economic recovery to be intact. Despite slower growth this year 
due to softened global demand, growth should pick up in 2024, supported by both 
domestic and global demand. Inflation is projected to be within the target range 
but would average higher in 2024 in line with the economic recovery and supply 
pressures related to El Niño. The Committee is monitoring additional impetus to growth
and inflation from government policies. The MPC agreed that an appropriate policy 
rate level would help keep inflation sustainably within the target range and foster 
long-term macro -financial stability by preempting the buildup of financial imbalances
that could arise in a low -for-long interest rate environment (Box 3: Appropriate monetary
policy for long -term macroeconomic and financial stability)
Under the prevailing monetary policy framework, the Committee seeks to maintain
price stability, support sustainable growth in line with potential, and preserve financial 
stability. In pursuit of these objectives and having normalized policy gradually up 
until the most recent meeting, the Committee deems the current policy interest 
rate to be consistent with long-term sustainable growth. In deliberating monetary 
policy going forward, the Committee will take into account growth and inflation 
outlook, including upside risks from government policies.
6/53Global economy
The global economy would continue 
to expand driven by the services 
sector this year. Manufacturing sector 
has started to show signs of 
improvement. Meanwhile, China’s 
economic recovery would be slower 
than expected.Inflation in many countries have 
gradually declined with falling energy 
and commodity prices,
prompting most central banks to 
keep their policy rates on hold. Trading partners’ growth outlook 
faces downside risks 
from the lagging effects of monetary 
policy tightening, the slowdown in 
global trade, and geopolitical tensions. 
Global Economy: Key Issues
7/53Global economy
8/53Services sector would continue to drive global growth in 2023, while manufacturing sector has shown signs of recovery. 
The US economy has continued to gain traction as reflected by strong private consumption and labor market indicators. 
Economic activities in the services sector would continue to drive global 
growth this year, while manufacturing activities have started to show signs 
of improvement. Looking ahead, global demand is likely to slowdown in 
the services sector after having accelerated earlier, but should pick up in 
the manufacturing sector as inventories are run down. Economic fundamentals in 
the US remain strong, especially private consumption and labor market. 404550556065

China’s economic recovery would be slower than expected due to lingering problems in the real estate sector impacting confide nceand domestic demand. 
This is reflected in the declines in real estate sector indicators including sales volume, price, and investment, as well as lowloan growth. Meanwhile, the Chinese 
government is not pursuing large -scale economic stimulus and is focused on achieving more sustainable growth as reflected in the ir recent policy actions which only 
address related problem areas, such as policy rate cuts and measures aimed at supporting the real estate sector. China’s export recovery is largely stable but 
remains weak overall. China’s economic recovery would be slower than expected due to real estate problems impacting domestic demand. 
Meanwhile, China’s exports have yet to see significant recovery.

Asian merchandise exports would recover in early 2024
driven by exports of electronics, which have started to show improvement signs.
Asian merchandise exports in 2023 have yet to see a firm recovery , especially exports of non -electronics goods. This is due to the slowdown in global demand, 
and high inventory levels despite the gradual rundown over the recent period. Nonetheless, electronics exports ha vestarted to show improvement signs, especially 
goods related to Artificial Intelligence (AI). It is expected that Asian merchandise exports would pass its lowest point in late 2023, and gradually recover in early 
2024 driven by the gradual recovery in global demand and an upturn in the global electronics cycle (Box 1: Exports recovery in Asia ).

2/Global economy
Since mid -2022, Asian merchandise exports have been declining with slowing 
global demand (Chart 1) resulting from (1) monetary policy tightening in many countries 
and (2) high inventory levels as businesses accelerated inventory accumulation during the 
COVID -19 pandemic when raw materials were in short supply and shipping times were longer .
Asian exports tend to be correlated with imports by G3 countries and China. 
Asia’s key export markets are G3 countries (US, euro area, and Japan) and China, accounting for 
48% of total exports. Meanwhile, imports by G3 countries and China would recover 
after their inventories have fallen below trend levels for some time, only then will 
imports and manufacturing activities start to pick up to replenish inventories.  
At present, inventory levels in G3 (especially US and the euro area), and China 
have gradually declined. Exports in some Asian economies have started to improve namely
South Korea and Taiwan, which are in line with declining inventories and the ongoing recovery
in Asian exports overall. Historical data shows that declines in imports, manufacturing 
activities, and inventory stock of G3 countries and China would last approximately 20 months
on average. Taking into consideration declining inventory levels among G3 economies 
and China, improvements in Asian exports, and historical trends in imports, manufacturing,
and inventory accumulation, it can be inferred that the cycle would be reach its 
lowest point in late 2023 and Asian exports would gradually recover in early 2024. Box 1: Exports recovery in Asia

Purchasing Manager’s Index (PMI), a leading indicator for manufacturing activities among 
G3 countries and China (Chart 2) , shows that new orders and new export orders have started 
to stabilize. Meanwhile, PMI for many countries have also started to see some improvements, 
indicating that the down cycle for Asian exports is nearing its end. A closer look at each 
product group reveals that some of Asia’s export products would likely recover sooner 
than the overall export cycle such as (1) automobile especially exports to the US and the 
euro area, which have continued to see improvements as input shortages abated and demand 
recovered. This is in line with the resumption in automobile inventory accumulation as the stock
levels in the US and euro area are still below pre -COVID levels; and (2) electronics ,which are 
expected to recover in Q4/2023 mainly on account of electronics inventory levels having declined
for quite some time, and higher demand for more advanced chips required for AI training. At 
present, South Korean and Taiwanese exports have started to see improvements recently.
In summary, Asian exports are expected to reach its lowest point in late  2023 before
recovering in early 2024, driven by a recovery in imports and manufacturing among G3 countries
and China after inventory accumulation have slowed and inventory levels are low. The recovery in 
Asian exports expected for late -Q3/2023 in the previous assessment was delayed due to 
China’s slower -than-expected economic recovery. Nonetheless, automobile and electronics 
exports are likely to recover sooner than overall exports due to low inventory levels of both 
product groups as well as improvements in demand.Box 1: Exports recovery in Asia

Global inflation gradually declined mainly due to falling energy prices. 
Most central banks are now keeping their policy rates on hold.
The Federal Reserve (Fed) raised its policy rate by 25 bps to 5.25 -5.50% at the FOMC
Meeting on 26 July 2023, and kept the policy rate on hold at the subsequent meeting
on 20 September 2023. The decisions were underpinned by strong economic growth
and tight labor market conditions. In this regard, the BOT revised up its assumption 
for the federal funds rate by 50 bps throughout the forecast period, while reducing 
the frequency of rate cuts in 2024 from 5 to 3 times. The revision was on account of 
stronger economic outlook in the US and persistently high inflation. 
The European Central Bank (ECB) raised its policy rate by 25 bps to 4.0% at the 
Governing Council Meeting on 14 September 2023 as inflationary pressures remain 
elevated. The ECB also signaled end of tightening cycle and discontinued reinvestments
under the Asset Purchase Program (APP) as previously announced in June 2023. 
Looking ahead, the ECB is likely to keep its policy rate on hold, the duration of 
which would be evaluated to appropriately account for uncertainties surrounding 
the current growth momentum. 
Most Asian central banks have started to put a hold to their policy rate in order 
to evaluate the monetary policy transmission from earlier rate hikes. This was also 
due to falling headline inflation although core inflation in some countries remain 
high. Nevertheless, there arepossibilities that some Asian central banks might raise 
rates further to address inflation risks.

Trading partners’ growth forecast for 2023 is revised up slightly on account of better -than-expected Q2/2023 
economic outturns for US and Japan ,while the forecast for 2024 is revised down as the recovery 
in the Chinese economy and Asian exports have been slower than expected.
Trading partners’ growth forecast for 2023 is revised up slightly on account of stronger -
than-expected growth outturns in Q2/2023 for US and Japan. In particular, the US has 
continued to see strong growth driven mainly by the services sector, while Japan’s exports 
growth was stronger than expected. However, trading partners’ growth forecast for 2024 
is revised down on account of China facing problems in its real estate sector and slower -
than-expected exports recovery in Asia (ex. China).
Risks to trading partners’ growth outlook remain skewed to the downside.
Downside risks : Slower -than-expected global economic recovery due to (1) the 
lagging effects of monetary policy actions both from the recent policy rate hikes 
and possibilities of further rate hikes as the inflation outlook faces risks of El Niño being
more severe than expected; (2) sharper -than-expected global trade slowdown 
especially due to softer demand from China; and (3) geopolitical tensions especially 
further escalation of US -China tensions as well as the prolonged China -Taiwan and 
Russia -Ukraine conflicts. 
Upside risks: Stronger -than-expected growth among Asian economies due to (1) 
increased international tourism resulting in a strong recovery in the service sectors, 
especially the return of Chinese tourists to countries in the region; and (2) stronger -
than-expected economic growth in China boosting Asian exports.

The Thai Economy: Key Issues
The Thai economy continued to recover 
driven mainly by private consumption. 
For 2023, growth is revised down on 
account of slower -than-expected 
recovery in both merchandise exports 
and tourism. For 2024, growth should pick 
up supported by both external and 
domestic demand. Labor market shows positive signs, 
especially employment in the tourism 
sector. Meanwhile, labor market 
conditions in the manufacturing sector 
remain stable. Workers in 
the agricultural sector would be 
negatively impacted by 
El Niño in the period ahead. Headline inflation is expected to 
return to the target range but is subject 
to upside risks. Core inflation forecast 
for 2024 is revised up and still subject 
to upside risks from government 
policies and potentially 
higher food prices. 
15/53The Thai economy
The Thai economy is projected to grow 2.8% in 2023 and 4.4% in 2024. Growth projection for 2023 is revised down on 
account of the delayed recovery in exports and tourism. However, growth should pick up in 2024 supported by both 
external and domestic demand, with additional stimulus from government policies .

Exports of servicesRevised down slightly for both 2023 and 2024. Foreign tourist arrivals forecasts are revised down on account of 
the slow recovery in the number of Chinese tourists, while other nationalities would continue to see a strong 
recovery. Projected tourism income is also revised down in line with the lower number of Chinese tourists who 
typically have higher spending per head. While tourists from other countries increase firmly, they  are short -haul 
tourists such as Malaysians which have lower spending per head. Therefore, they cannot offset the decline in 
tourism receipts .  
Private consumptionRevised up mainly on account of services spending, especially in hotels and restaurants. This is in line with improving 
consumer confidence and the recovery in tourism. Private consumption would continue to expand in 2024 
supported by the ongoing economic recovery and additional stimulus from government policies.   
Merchandise 
exports (Value)Merchandise exports would contract due to the slowdown in demand from China. The ongoing global economic
recovery is driven primarily by services sector and thus would have limited spillover benefits to Thai exports. 
Exports would resume positive growth in 2024 supported by an upturn in the electronics cycle early next year as 
well as the recovery in global demand for goods. 
Private investmentRevised down in 2023 on account of lower -than-expected investment outturns. However, private investment is 
expected to see strong growth in 2024 driven by the recovery in exports,  investments in new industries, and 
new public private partnership (PPP) projects  namely the high -speed railway linking 3 airports which has been 
progressing well. Additionally, there are positive signals from increasing machinery imports, construction permits, 
and investment approvals by the Board of Investment (BOI).Summary of economic forecasts
17/53The Thai economy
•Revised down foreign tourist arrivals projection for 2023 to 28.5 million 
persons on account of the slower -than-expected recovery in the number of 
Chinese tourists. While visa -exemptions have benefited tourist arrivals from 
China, Chinese tourists are spending more cautiously due to the current 
economic conditions in China. Nonetheless, tourist arrivals from other countries such 
as Malaysia, Russia, South Korea, and Taiwan have continued to recover. 
•Revised down foreign tourist arrivals projection for 2024 to 35 million persons
on account of a slow recovery in the number of Chinese tourists throughout 
the forecast period. However, Chinese tourists and tourists of other nationalities
are still expected to recover given improved tourist demand and increased 
number of flights to Thailand.Foreign tourist arrivals  would continue to recover, but would turn out slightly lower than previously expected due to 
the slow recovery in the number of Chinese tourists, while the recovery for other nationalities is still well underway .

Private consumption should continue to expand due to a recovery in the services sector, improvements in tourism and 
merchandise exports from stronger external demand going forward, as well as stimulus from government policies. 
The baseline projection has taken into account some of the effects of government 
policies as follow:
•10,000 baht digital wallet: The government announced that it would allocate 560 
billion baht for money transfers to individuals in the first half of 2024. However, the 
implementation model remains uncertain. Empirical analysis suggests that the fiscal 
multiplier of money transfers are generally lower than direct government consumptio n 
or investment, although it depends on the target group, terms and conditions, and 
prevailing economic conditions at the time. As such, more clarity about the implementation
is required before an assessment on the overall economic impact can be made.  
•Minimum wage increase: It is expected that the minimum wage will be raised to 400 
baht per day within 2024. However, the overall impact on average wages remain 
uncertain as it would depend on the effective date, the size of the increase, and the 
coverage area where the new minimum wage will be applied. The impact would also 
depends on the implementation of new minimum wage by employers, who will also 
take into account the compensatory measures from the government.

Merchandise exports would recover inearly 2024 driven byanupturn intheglobal electronics cycle andarecovery in
global demand forgoods .
•Merchandise exports in Q2 -2023 were lower than expected mainly due 
to export quantities. The slowing down exports include agricultural products, 
agro-manufacturing products, and air conditioners which had lower -than-expected
orders from trading partners.  
•Looking ahead, exports quantities would recover on the back of (1) the 
upturn in the global electronics cycle benefiting Thai exports more strongly 
in early 2024; and (2) the recovery in global demand for goods especially 
advanced economies’ demand for industrial products.
•Export prices remain high in line with rising prices of petrochemical products, 
and of agricultural goods as a result of El Niño.
•Export outlook is subject to downside risks  from possibility of trading partners’
growth slowdown, and delays of electronics up -cycle.

•Headline inflation forecast for 2023 is revised down mainly on account 
of lower -than-expected core inflation and energy price outturns, as well as 
government subsidies for electricity costs and diesel prices throughout the 
remainder of 2023. Headline inflation forecast for 2024 is revised up on 
account of raw food prices being affected by El Niño which is likely to be 
more severe, and core inflation rising due to the effects of government

•Core inflation forecast for 2023 is revised down on account of lower -
than-expected inflation outturns, especially prices of prepared food, and 
lower cost passthrough from businesses to consumers. Nonetheless, the 
government’s stimulus policies could put more pressure to inflation in 
2024. Thus, core inflation forecast in 2024 is higher than this year and 
remains near the previous assessment .

•Trading partners’ growth for 2023 is revised up slightly on account of stronger 
global economic growth driven by the services sector as reflected in better -than-
expected growth outturns for US and Japan. The forecast for 2024 is revised down on 
account of slower -than-expected recovery in both the Chinese economy and exports 
from Asia (ex. China). 
•The federal funds rate in 2023 is revised up 50bps due to stronger -than-expected 
economic growth and slower -than-expected decline in inflation in the US. The 
federal funds rate in 2024 is expected to decline at a slower pace than previously 
expected given the strong growth outlook and persistently high inflation. 
•Regional currencies (excluding the Chinese yuan) would depreciate throughout 
the forecast period on account of the slower -than-expected recovery of Asian economies . 
•Dubai crude oil prices is revised down throughout the forecast period on account of 
lower price outturns due to slowdown in global oil demand. 
•Farm income (excluding government support measures) would contract in both 
2023 and 2024 due to lower output as a result of El Niño. Meanwhile, prices of 
agricultural products are expected to rise, especially rice due to food security concerns , 
which should help offset the contraction in farm income to some extent.
•Public spending at current prices for 2023 is revised down slightly on account of 
budgetary delays. The forecast for 2024 is revised up in accordance with FY2025 budget
and delayed budget disbursements in 2023 being carried over.

Assumptions for Dubai crude oil prices are revised down throughout the forecast period due to lower price outturns 
following the global economic slowdown despite crude oil supply being depressed by OPEC+’s production cuts.
Dubai crude oil prices assumptions are revised down from 86 to 83 US 
dollar per barrel in 2023 and from 90 to 85 US dollar per barrel in 2024 on 
account of:
•Lower -than-expected oil price outturns due to the global economic slowdown , 
especially China’s slower -than-expected economic recovery which resulted 
in weaker -than-expected oil demand, despite Saudi Arabia announcing production
cuts through to end -2023.  
Risks to the outlook for Dubai crude oil prices are now balanced:
•Upside risks:  (1) the Russia -Ukraine conflict  could escalate, broaden, and 
become more prolonged than expected; (2) severe weather conditions 
due to El Niño and the US entering its hurricane season; (3) production cuts 
by OPEC+ could be sharper than expected.
•Downside risks: (1)slower -than-expected global economic recovery ;and
(2)potentially higher oiloutput from Iranifthenuclear agreement with
theUSisreached .

The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) declared 
the arrival of El Niño1/ in June 2023. The NOAA expects this year’s El Niño to be the 
most severe of its kind in the past 7 years (Chart 1) and that weather conditions will 
return to normal in early 2024, at the earliest. As a result of El Niño, rainfall in Thailand 
between June -August 2023 has been 15% lower than historical levels, which would 
likely result in crop output to decline by 0.9  %YoY in the second half of 2023 and 5.4  
%YoY in the first half of 2024. 
Nonetheless, the impact of El Niño differs across various agricultural products . 
In terms of output, field crops would be more affected than perennial plants because 
field crops have less drought -tolerance. In addition, crops that rely on water from dams 
for irrigation are more affected than those that rely on rain  in rainy season. The different 
global market structures and idiosyncratic factors across different crops also mean that 
price sensitivity to supply shocks can vary. The net impacts of El Niño on farm income 
going forward are as follows (Chart 2):
1. Income of in -season rice farmers who grow rice during the rainy season 
(about 64% of all farmers) would increase despite a slowdown in crop output during 
the harvest period in Q4/2023. This is because global rice prices would increase due to 
rice exports ban by India –one of the world’s largest rice exporters –and a risk of limitationBox 2: El Niño –a risk to Thai economy going forward
1/ El Niño is a phenomenon that occurs on the western Pacific Ocean that causes drought in 
regions/countries such as Southeast Asia, Australia, India, Central America, West and South Africa, 
while causing heavy rainfall elsewhere such as South America, Central Asia, East Africa, and 
souther n US states.

on Vietnam rice export. These two factors would result in rice prices continuing to 
increase through to end -2024, when global rice output might have returned to normal.
2. Income of sugarcane, rubber, cassava, and durian farmers (21% of all 
farmers) would remain largely unaffected.  (1) Sugarcane: crop output and price 
would be stable in H2/2023, but sugarcane farmers’ income would decline in H1/2024 
due to lower crop output in Thailand as well as lower global sugarcane prices given 
increased sugarcane production in Brazil, the world’s top exporter of sugarcane who 
would benefit from El Niño; (2) Cassava: the impact of lower crop output would be 
offset by higher prices, but cassava prices would remain low overall due to lower 
quality; (3) Rubber and durian: both rubber and durian are perennial plants and thus 
their crop output in H2/2023 would largely be unaffected and prices are likely to be 
largely unchanged from the previous year. In H1/2024, it is expected that the income of 
rubber farmers would gradually recover as prices increase with growing rubber demand 
from China to replenish their rubber inventory, as well as strong output growth due to a 
low base in 2023. Meanwhile, income of durian farmers would likely decline slightly due 
to a contraction in crop output and prices being depressed by increased competition.   
3. Income of off -season rice farmers who grow rice during the drought 
season and oil palm farmers (14% of all farmers) would contract. For off -season 
rice, lower water levels in dams would result in less irrigation for off -season rice 
farming. This would lead to a sharp contraction in off -season rice output that cannot 
be offset by higher prices. For oil palm, crop output in H2/2023 would contract due to a high base in 2022 when weather conditions were more conducive. Meanwhile, oil 
palm prices have started to stabilize from the levels seen during the onset of the 
Russia -Ukraine conflict. However, income of oil palm farmers in H1/2024 would be 
largely stable due to higher price and contraction in global oil palm output. 
On the whole, El Niño would result in overall farm income (after taking 
into account price movements of different crops) contracting 0.4 %YoY in 
H2/2023 and 2.1 %YoY in H1/2024. This is primarily due to lower crop output both 
from Thai farmers and globally. Meanwhile, certain exporters would seize their exports 
of those crops for food security purposes, resulting in higher prices of some crops 
which would help offset some of the income losses for Thai farmers. The overall 
impact on Thailand’s economic growth is about 0.1 percentage point in 2023 and 
0.2 percentage point in 2024 (vis-à-vis a scenario without El Niño) mainly due to 
lower crop output, especially rice and sugarcane, as well as agro -manufacturing 
products. The effects of El Niño would also result in higher headline inflation by 
about 0.2 percentage point in 2023 and 0.4 percentage point in 2024 (vis-à-vis a 
scenario without El Niño) mainly due to higher food prices. Meanwhile, there remains 
the risk that El Niño would result in higher inflation than assessed.

Financial conditions tightened somewhat from the previous quarter:
•Funding costs increased slightly consistent with the policy rate. 
Private credit growth has slowed down partly due to a normalization
after having accelerated from financial measures implemented 
during the COVID -19 pandemic.
•Exchange rate  (FX) depreciated 2% from the previous quarter due 
to (1) an appreciation of the US dollar index after the Fed signaled 
that it would maintain high policy rate for longer; (2) a depreciation 
of the Chinese yuan due to concerns over China’s economic recovery;
and (3) Thailand’s lower -than-expected GDP and current account

Benchmark lending rates increased. Commercial banks gradually raised their lending rates after the MPC raised the policy rate to 2.50% at the MPC meeting on 27 
September 2023. The transmission from policy rate to lending rates during this normalization cycle is close to levels seen in the past at 60%. Commercial banks passed 
on the higher financing costs to the minimum retail rate (MRR) to a lesser degree compared to the minimum loan rate (MLR) to soften the impact on vulnerable 
borrowers, most of whom are subject to the MRR. The average deposit rates increased slightly. Commercial banks passed on the higher financing costs mostly to 
long-term fixed deposits in order to manage costs. The transmission from policy rate to both the savings and fixed deposit rates is weaker than in the past because 
commercial banks have abundant liquidity as reflected in the loan -to-deposit (L/D) ratio of 92.3%, which is lower than past aver age.Commercial bank’s lending rates increased in line with the policy rate. While deposit rates increased slowly compared to 
increases in the past.

Short-term government bond yields increased in line with the policy rate. Meanwhile, long-term government bond yields increased in line with movements in US 
Treasury yields, which was driven by expectations about the Fed’s monetary policy direction where the high policy rate might be maintained for a longer period. 
The increase was also due to concerns that Thai government bond issuance would pick up in the period ahead to finance the gov ernment’s stimulus policies. Credit 
spreads remain stable from the previous quarter, with limited impact from recent defaults on some corporate bonds. Financing costs in the bond market have increased in line with US Treasury yields. The increase was also due to 
domestic factors.

In Q2 -2023, large corporate loan growth (credit limit > 500 million baht) 
slowed down due to debt repayments primarily. Loans extended to export -related 
manufacturing businesses have continued to contract in line with the slowdown in 
exports. Some large corporates have continued to shift to issuing bonds , especially 
in the utility, energy, and other services sectors. 
SMEs loan growth (credit limit ≤500 million baht) contracted from the same period 
last year. This was due to repayment on maturing soft loans as well as more cautious 
lending on the part of the banks. 
Household credit growth overall slightly slowed down especially personal loans 
and credit card loans. Mortgage loan growth was largely stable from the previous 
quarter. Auto loan growth increased slightly from the previous quarter but 
remained low due to more cautious lending behavior given increased credit risks 
of borrowers and risks about collateral value.Private credit in Q2/2023 slowed down overall.

Business loan growth has slowed down and is normalizing after having accelerated by financial measures 
implemented during the COVID -19 pandemic. Most businesses are still able to obtain credit lines that are 
comparable to what they received pre -COVID.
Over the past 3 months, more than 80% of businesses are still able to obtain credit lines that 
are comparable to what they received pre -COVID. Some businesses received higher credit lines 
such as chemical manufacturing, retail sales, and financial services. Only a handful of businesses 
received lower credit lines such as textiles and garments, other services, and plastic and glass 
manufacturing. Survey results found that businesses utilize bank credit lines less because they have 
sufficient working capital as well as access to alternative financing sources. Business loan growth has slowed down partly due to a normalization to its 
trend after having accelerated by financial measures implemented during the 
COVID -19 pandemic. It is expected that credit demand will recover in tandem 
with economic activities.

In Q3-2023, the baht averaged 35.11 per U.S. dollar, depreciating from the average value of 34.48 per U.S. dollar in the previous quarter. The baht’s movement 
was driven by market expectations about the Fed’s monetary policy, the Chinese yuan’s depreciation, Thailand’s lower -than-expect ed economic outturns, net capital 
outflows in Q3 -2023 from both bonds and equities, and investors waiting for clarity on government policies that may have implica tions for the economy and fiscal 
sustainability in the future. The nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) averaged 119.98, largely unchanged from the previous quarter . This is because the baht’s 
movement was in tandem with trading partners’ and competitors’ currencies. The baht on average depreciated from the previous quarter due to both external and Thailand -specific factors.

(2 Aug 2023)
The gradual policy normalization over the recent meetings has brought the 
current policy interest rate to a level that is appropriate for supporting long -
term sustainable growth. In deliberating monetary policy going forward, the 
Committee will take into account growth and inflation outlook, including upside 
risks from government policies.2.50%Current policy rate:The appropriate policy rate level would help keep inflation sustainably within 
the target range and foster long -term macro -financial stability by preventing 
the buildup of financial imbalances that could arise from a low -for-long 
interest rate environment  (Box 3: Appropriate monetary policy for long -term 
macroeconomic and financial stability ).The Thai economy overall continued to recover, albeit at a slower pace due 
to softer global demand. That said, growth should pick up in 2024, supported 
by both domestic and global demand. Inflation is projected to be within the 
target range and would average higher in 2024 due to the economic recovery 
and El Nino -related supply pressure. The Committee will continue to monitor 
additional impetus to growth and inflation from government policies. MPC voted unanimously to 
raise the policy rate by 
0.25 percentage pointThe gradual policy normalization has brought the current policy rate to a level that is consistent with long -term 
sustainable growth.

(27 Sep 2023)MPC voted unanimously to 
raise the policy rate by 
0.25 percentage point
41/53Monetary Policy Decision
Achieving stable and sustainable economic growth requires a stable and sound 
financial system that could effectively perform intermediary role and is not a source 
of economic uncertainties itself. Country experiences around the world clearly demonstrated
that severe and prolonged economic recessions tend to be caused by the buildup of 
financial imbalances that ultimately result in a financial crisis that propagates to the real 
economy at large. The most recent example is the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) in 2008.
Volatility in the financial system could impact the real economy through many 
channels and in many ways. Higher credit growth could boost economic activities through 
increased consumption and investment, but at the same time, it could lead to over -
indebtedness or unproductive investments that result in a buildup of vulnerabilities in the 
financial system. How much credit is extended also plays a part in determining prices of 
assets such as bonds and real estate. This affects not only households’ wealth and 
consumption but also the values of collateral assets that are used to spur more borrowing 
in a self -reinforcing effect. As a result, asset prices could increase more than they should, 
leading to speculative investments and, ultimately, asset price bubbles.
In the face of shocks, the buildup of vulnerabilities would exacerbate the 
impact of shocks on the broader economy. Banks or creditors that lose confidence in 
the economy will downsize their lending portfolio or call for early repayments, which mayBox 3: Appropriate monetary policy for long -term macroeconomic and financial stability 
force borrowers tosellofftheir assets rapidly torepay debt (firesale).Such firesales
would result inadecline inasset prices andcollateral value, leading toacontinued
contraction incredit inaself-reinforcing manner .Intheworst -case scenario where
financial institutions areunder system -wide distress such asduring theGFC,thelackof
confidence andtrustcould bring interbank borrowing toacomplete stop, resulting ina
credit crunch where banks areunable tocarry outtheirroles infinancial intermediation .
Thissignificantly impacts therealeconomy asbusinesses would lacktheworking capital to
engage inanysorts ofeconomic activity tothepoint where theymight have tolayoff
their employees orclose down completely .Thisinturnaffects theincome oflabor
andhouseholds, especially those thatbecame highly indebted during theperiod prior.
The aforementioned linkage between financial imbalances and likelihood of 
crisis is supported by a vast body of literature, both theoretical studies and empirical 
studies, that performs a cross -country analysis using large sample of countries. 
Theoretical studies such as the credit cycle model (Kiyotaki and Moore, 1997) and 
financial accelerator model (Bernanke et al., 1999). Empirical studies such as a cross -
country analysis of 14 countries during 1870 -2008 (Schularick and Taylor, 2012) or the 
cross-country analysis of 20 countries during 1975 -2014 (Anundsen et al., 2016). One 
study also found that financial crisis could result in permanent output loss for an 
economy over the long run (Juselius et al., 2017). 
42/53Monetary Policy Decision
Monetary policy is an important tool for keeping financial imbalances in check and 
safeguarding against its impact on macroeconomic and financial stability in the long run. 
Low interest rates and accommodative financial conditions are among the factors that promote 
credit growth and increases in asset prices, partly through the search -for-yield behavior that 
takes place in such environment. Should the search for yield becomes too excessive or 
prolonged, it could lead to an unsustainable financial boom that would eventually result in 
sharp price volatilities (boom -bust cycle). Moreover, persistently low borrowing costs could 
result in an underpricing of risks among investors and cause borrowers like businesses and 
households to overestimate their ability to repay debt. In summary, maintaining an 
accommodative monetary policy stance for longer than warranted by the prevailing 
economic contexts would lead to a buildup of vulnerabilities in the financial system due 
to increased lending, rising asset prices, and increased risk -taking by investors, businesses, 
and households. 
These are the reasons why the BOT has always emphasized the importance of 
macroeconomic and financial stability in conducting monetary policy, and have developed 
tools to systematically assess financial stability risks. Such tools include a measurement of 
the financial cycle (FC)1/ , which is used to assess financial stability risks, the Growth -at-Risk 
(GaR)2/framework, which assesses the financial cycle in conjunction with downside risks to 
growth. The BOT also monitors financial stability through a variety of indicators to assessBox 3: Appropriate monetary policy for long -term macroeconomic and financial stability 
3/Real policy interest rate is calculated by subtracting the inflation rate from the policy rate to 
reflect the real rate of return that one would receive in the future. The inflation rate used in 
such calculation can vary depending on the methodology.

pockets of risks such as investments in unrated bonds, and property speculation. The 
BOT also uses macroprudential policy to address financial stability risks in a targeted 
manner such as the LTV (Loan -to-Value) measure5/ to limit mortgage loan growth for 
second homes and beyond that could be used for property speculation.
Over the past decade, the Thai economy has continually faced with shocks 
including the COVID -19 pandemic. As a result, the monetary policy had to 
maintain an accommodative stance for an extended period of time as reflected 
by the real policy interest rates in Thailand, which are calculated using various 
measures of inflation, remaining below 0% since 2012 (Chart 1) . However, the real 
policy interest rates have gradually edged up closer to 0% since the latter half of 2022. 
This was after the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) assessed that a very accommodative
monetary policy stance has become less necessary given the current growth and 
inflation outlook and thus decided to gradually normalize the policy rate to a level 
consistent with long -term sustainable growth. 
The appropriate interest rate level is among the factors that could prevent 
household debt problems from becoming more widespread (Chart 2). The 
elevated household debt levels seen currently is in part a result of the sharp increase 
in bank lending after the historical flood in 2011 as well as government stimulus 
measures. As a result, household debt to GDP6/ grew from 76.1% in 2012 to 85.9% in 
2015, and remained elevated since. Household debt to GDP eventually rose above 
90% in 2020 partly due to income losses during the COVID -19 pandemic. Box 3: Appropriate monetary policy for long -term macroeconomic and financial stability 
5/ BOT announced regulations for housing loans by tightening the Loan to Value (LTV) ratio, which 
became effective on 1 April 2019. 
6/ BOT enhanced the coverage of its household debt statistics in June 2023.
7/ Based on analysis by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) The current household debt to GDP level of 90.7% as of end Q2 -2023 is still higher 
than levels seen in the past and is higher than the sustainable level of 80%7/.  This 
reflects the fact that Thai households still have high debt service burden, which is 
one of the vulnerabilities that could hinder economic growth going forward.

8/ BOT announced measures to sustainably address household debt problems  in July 2023.Encouraging responsible lending practices 
and addressing persistent debt
Ensuring new debts are of good credit quality; discouraging excessive borrowing; 
addressing debt overhang and offering options for debtors with persistent debts to 
fully repay their loans.
Risk-Based Pricing : RBP Debt Service Ratio : DSR
Accomodate debtors with better 
repayment history to be offered better 
loan terms and conditions, and 
increase access to formal loans based 
on each borrower’s risk profile Ensure that the approved loan 
amount is in line with the debtor’s 
repayment capacity and residual 
income. This would address debt 
problems at the initial stage, thus 
reducing the risk of persistent debt or 
non-performing loans.Chart 3: Measures to sustainably address household debt problemsBox 3: Appropriate monetary policy for long -term macroeconomic and financial stability 
In the current context where Thailand’s economic recovery has continued 
to gain traction, monetary policy should focus on laying a foundation for 
economic and financial stability over the longer -term. The appropriate policy rate 
level would help the economy rebalance and prevent further buildup of 
vulnerabilities in the financial system. However, higher interest rates have led to 
higher debt burden and impacted debt serviceability of some SMEs and households, 
especially those that are still vulnerable due to slow income recovery. Against this 
backdrop, the BOT has implemented measures to assist debtors to alleviate and 
resolve their debt problems in a targeted manner such as debt restructuring programs, 
Debt Clinic, measures to promote refinancing, and debt consolidation.
In addition, the BOT has placed emphasis on comprehensive and fair debt 
restructuring solutions that will not increase debtors’ burden over the long term 
by implementing measures to sustainably address household debt problems8/ 
(Chart 3). This include Responsible  Lending practices to address persistent debt, 
the adoption of risk-based pricing (RBP), and application of debt  service ratio 
(DSR) limits.  These 3 measures would work together in adjusting the behavior of 
both creditors and debtors throughout their debt journey. The aim is to address 
Thailand’s household debt problems and bring household debt down to more 
sustainable levels, which reduce financial stability risks and enhance economic and 
financial stability over the long term.
