1. Executive SummaryExecutive Summary
At the meetings in February and March 2022, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) 
voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 0.50 percent. It is expected that the Thai 
economy would continue to expand on the back of the recovery in domestic demand and 
tourism in the period ahead. The Committee assesses that the sanctions imposed on Russia
would not impact the overall path of Thailand’s economic recovery. The outbreak of COVID -19 
Omicron variant had also impacted economic activities less than the previous waves. Headline 
inflation in 2022 is expected to average higher than the target range mainly due to rising energy 
prices and cost passthrough to food prices. It is expected that headline inflation would gradually 
decline into the target range in early 2023 given that energy prices are unlikely rise further due to 
the expected increase in oil supply from OPEC+ and US producers, the global shortage of raw 
materials and commodities being resolved, and low demand -pull inflationary pressure. 
The MPC’s policy decision continues to place emphasis on supporting the economic 
recovery. The MPC assess that rising inflation at the current juncture was due to short -term 
price fluctuations and therefore could be looked through. Rising inflation have been driven 
mostly by cost -push inflation, while demand -pull inflation remains low. Medium -term inflation 
expectations also remain well -anchored within the target range. In this regard, the MPC views that 
the policy rate should be kept on hold to support the continuity of the ongoing economic 
recovery. The MPC will continue to monitor factors that affect the growth and inflation outlook 
namely global energy and commodity prices, cost passthrough to consumer prices, and geopolitical
tensions which could become more widespread and lead to more uncertainties in the future. The 
MPC stands ready to deploy the appropriate policy tools if needed. Global Economy
Trading partners are expected to grow 3.6% in 2022 and 3.2% in 2023, a slower pace 
compared to the previous assessment. This downward revision to trading partners’ growth forecasts 
is due to the sanctions against Russia resulting in rising energy and commodity prices globally, and 
impacting international trade and global supply chains especially for goods that Russia and Ukraine 
are the main exporters. Meanwhile, the outbreak of COVID -19 Omicron variant had limited impact on 
economic activities with many countries now deciding to live with the virus and accelerate vaccination 
efforts. Global inflation is likely to rise further with rising energy and commodity prices (Box: “Global 
oil prices: recent developments and outlook ”). As a result of rising inflation and economies resuming
strong growth on par with pre -COVID levels, especially among advanced economies, major central 
banks have started to signal tighter monetary policy stances . However,trading partners’ growth 
outlook is subjected to more downside risks stemming from the Russia -Ukraine conflict and 
sanctions against Russia that could turn out to be more severe and protracted than expected. This 
would impact the Thai economy mainly through a slowdown in trading partners’ growth as well as 
high energy and commodity prices (Box: “ Channels through which the Russia -Ukraine conflict 
impacts the Thai economy ”)
The Thai Economy
The Thai Economy is expected to continue expanding at 3.2% in 2022 and 4.4% in 2023
on the back of the recovery in domestic demand and tourism. GDP growth outturns in Q4/2021 were 
better than expected, especially private consumption. Meanwhile, the outbreak of Omicron did not 
have much impact on economic activities. Nevertheless, labor market conditions remain fragile and 
could hinder private consumption going forward. Fragility in the labor market is reflected by the 
employment rate which remains below pre -COVID levels and is recovering quite slowly compared to 
previous crises (Box: “ 2-year anniversary of COVID -19: How much has the Thai labor market recovered? ”Monetary Policy Conduct in the First Quarter of 2022 Assessment of the Economic and Financial Outlook
6/72Executive Summary
TheThai econo my is also subjected to more downside risks stemming from possibilities
that the global supply disruption might be prolonged further due to sanctions against Russia, and 
the impact of higher energy and commodity prices on the cost of living for households and input 
costs for businesses, especially for vulnerable groups such as low -income households that are 
still recovering slowly and are heavily indebted. (Box: “Impact of inflation on households across 
different income groups”)
Inflation
Headline inflation is expected to be 4.9% in 2022 and 1.7% in 2023. It is expected 
that headline inflation will rise above 5% in the second and third quarters of 2022 before 
declining in the latter half of 2022 and returning within the target range in early 2023 . 
High inflation rates in the second and third quarters reflect the base effect of low oil prices and 
government measures to assist with the cost of living in 2022. This will result in a higher year -on-year
inflation number even if the actual price level doesn’t increase much. 
Rising h eadline inflation is driven mainly by cost -push inflation from high energy prices
and cost -passthrough to food prices. While the share of goods whose price have increased has 
gotten larger, price increases have most been limited to goods in the energy and food categories. 
Inflation is expected to eventually return to the target range given that energy and food prices 
are unlikely to rise further as OPEC+ and US oil producers ramp up production. Meanwhile, 
demand -pull inflation remains low. Medium -term inflation expectations remain well -anchored
within the target range and were not influenced by short -term price fluctuations. Well -anchored 
inflation expectations reduce the risks that the public expects prices to rise indefinitely and 
therefore leading to prices actually being raised (second -round effect). There are no signs of such 
risks currently. However, the inflation outlook is subjected to more upside risks as oil prices could turn out 
to be higher than expected and cost passthrough from producers to consumer prices might be higher 
than expected both directly and indirectly from higher input and transportation costs. The MPC will 
continue to monitor inflation developments closely to ensure that medium -term inflation expectations
remain in line with the monetary policy target. 
Financial Conditions and Financial Stability
Overall financial conditions in Thailand remain accommodative. Liquidity in the financial 
system is still abundant although it has tightened somewhat from recent bouts of volatility in the 
global financial market. On exchange rates, the baht against the U.S. dollar appreciated in the early 
parts of Q1/2022 due to the recovery prospects of the Thai tourism sector, but subsequently depreciated
as a result of the Russia -Ukraine conflict and policy rate hikes by major central banks . Financial stability
remain sound overall but some household and businesses have become more vulnerable due to 
the impact of COVID -19, higher cost of living, and higher input costs. At the same time, debt -to-income 
ratios among households and businesses remain elevated. 
Fiscal measures and coordination of policy responses are critical to supporting economic 
growth amidst the large degrees of uncertainties. Fiscal measures that could support economic 
growth in a well -targeted manner by creating income and easing the cost of living for vulnerable groups 
are particularly important. Meanwhile, monetary policy should remain accommodative to ensure 
overall financial conditions are conducive to growth. In addition, financial and credit measures aimed at 
distributing liquidity and alleviating debt burden, especially for those whose income have yet to fully 
recover, should proceed in tandem with efforts to encourage financial institutions to offer debt restructuring
solutions that is sustainable and appropriate to the long -term debt repayment capacity of the borrowers . 
This would strengthen financial stability and ensure that it would not hold back economic growth in 
the period ahead. The MPC will continue to monitor factors that could impact the economic outlook 
and stands ready to deploy the appropriate policy tools to support the economic recovery, while also 
safeguarding price stability and financial stability.

Trading partners registered slower growth 
than previously assessed due to the impact 
of sanctions against Russia on commodity 
prices and the global supply chain. Global Economy: Key Issues
The outbreak of Omicron had limited 
impact on economic activities. 
Many countries have implemented 
the ‘live with virus’ policy and focus on 
accelerating vaccination. Inflation in trading partner economies rose 
sharply in tandem with the sharp rise in 
energy and commodity prices due to 
sanctions against Russia. Global Economy
The number of COVID -19 Omicron cases has increased in Q1/2022 . 
Many countries view the Omicron variant as less deadly compared 
to the Delta variant partly because of the progress made in vaccinating
the population including the administration of booster shots which 
have increased in many countries. Meanwhile, containment measures
remain relaxed. 
However, there are some countries/areas where the outbreak 
has been more severe than expected such as Japan, South Korea,
and Hong Kong. On the whole, the global economy remains at risk 
of an outbreak of a new COVID -19 variant.
10/72The number of COVID -19 cases in many countries increased due to the outbreak of the Omicron variant but containment
measures have been relaxed overall thus the impact on economic activities has been limited. Many countries now 
optto live with the virus and accelerating the distribution of vaccine booster shots to the population.

11/72The Russia -Ukraine conflict and sanctions against Russia led to increases in energy and commodity prices, and affected 
international trade and supply chain through shortages of goods that Russia and Ukraine are the main exporters.
The Russia -Ukraine conflict impacts the global economy through 2 main channels :
1.Higher energy and commodity prices affect the c osts faced by producers and cost of living for the consumers , which in turn weigh on t he economic 
recovery through a slowdown in consumption and investment. 
2.Supply chain of goods that Russia and Ukraine are the main exporters. Russia is a key exporter of petroleum products, pig iron, palladium (input for 
production of car exhaust pipes and semiconductors), nickel (input for production of stainless steel and EV batteries), chemi calfertilizers, and wheat 
(for both human and animal consumption). Ukraine is a key exporter offood products namely wheat, vegetable oil, as well as pig iron (input for

conflict, especially if it lasts longer than expected. Private consumption is gradually recovering as COVID -19 
containment measures are relaxed but might be dampened by the impact of the Russia -Ukraine conflict. 
Industrial manufacturing is still registering growth due to excess demand and the production of goods to replenish inventory that was previously run

of COVID -19 cases has passed its peak. However, the recovery of consumption is still fragile as a prolonged conflict between Russia and Ukraine could 
dampen consumer confidence and rising inflation could affect purchasing power. 30405060

Inflation rose sharply in many countries on the back of rising energy and commodity prices. Meanwhile, global supply 
disruption is still ongoing but has alleviated somewhat as reflected by recent improvements in shipping time for goods in the
global supply chain. 
Global inflation rose sharply due to rising energy and commodity 
prices as a result of the Russia -Ukraine conflict. Inflation in G3 countries 
has continued to rise with the ongoing economic recovery and rising 
energy prices. Inflation in Asian economies has risen mainly among those 
that are net energy importers. The relatively modest inflation in Asia is 
partly due to government measures such as energy price controls, energy -
related tax reductions, and government subsidies. 
The global supply disruption is still ongoing but has alleviated somewhat . 
Shipping time in the global supply chain has improved recently as 
demand -supply imbalances decline, partly due to the outbreak of Omicron 
leading to a slowdown in demand. Looking ahead, shipping costs are likely 
to remain high and shipping times would still be long. Special Issue 1: Global oil prices: recent developments and outlook

Global Economy
The combination of accelerating inflation and some economies ’ growths returning to pre -COVID levels has prompted 
central banks, especially those in advanced economies, to signal tighter monetary policy stances.
The Federal Reserve (Fed) raised its policy rate from 0 -0.25 percentage points to 
0.25-0.50 at the FOMC Meeting on 15 -16 March 2022. The decision was underpinned
by strong economic growth, tight labor market conditions, as well as high and 
rising inflation. Looking ahead, the Fed is likely to raise the policy rates six  more times in 
the rest of 2022, while also reducing the size of its balance sheet (quantitative tightening )
starting from Q2/2022. This is because inflation has risen sharply in tandem with the 
strong economic recovery supported by large fiscal stimulus and pent -up demand 
from the period before. Meanwhile, the manufacturing sector and the labor market are 
unable to adapt to rising demand in time, resulting in significant inflationary pressure. 
The European Central Bank (ECB) decided to maintain its policy rate and 
terminate the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) at the end of 
March 2022. The ECB also announced that it would reduce asset purchases under the 
Asset Purchase Programme (APP) in the second quarter of this year. Furthermore, the 
ECB noted that it might end the APP in the third quarter this year if medium -term 
inflation remains high and that it might raise the policy rate after the APP’s conclusion.

Global oil prices: recent developments and outlookSpecial Issue 1Special issue 1: Global oil prices: recent developments and outlook
Dubai crude oil prices reached an eight -year high in March 2022 at over 
100 U.S. dollar per barrel. This was driven by concerns that the Russia -Ukraine 
conflict and the economic and financial sanctions against Russia would result in a 
significant decrease in crude oil supply from Russia. Oil supply from other producers 
such as OPEC and the US might not be able to offset the decline in crude oil from 
Russia, while the demand for oil is still on the rise. As a result, the already tight oil 
market is likely to tighten further and become more fragile, leading to greater 
volatility in crude oil prices going forward.  
Russia is the world’s second largest producer and exporter of oil and 
natural gas. Russia produces up to 10 -11 million barrels of crude oil per day, which is 
about 10 percent of global crude oil production. About half of Russia’s crude oil 
production are exported, with the main destinations being Europe (3 million barrels 
per day) and China (1.4 million barrels per day) (Chart 1). It is likely that Europe, a 
major export market for Russian energy commodities , would avoid directly imposing 
energy -related sanctions against Russia given its dependence on energy from Russia, 
especially natural gas which could not be easily substituted by other exporters. 
However, it is expected that sanctions imposed by other countries would indirectly 
impact Russian energy exports especially (1) the removal of selected Russian banks 
from SWIFT1which would pose an obstacle to trade settlements with Russia; and (2) 
sanctions imposed by the private sector such as a large oil transport company 
announcing that it would not transport oil to and from Russia.

0 1 2 3 4 5 6TotalOtherUKUSChinaEuropeSpecial issue 1: Global oil prices: recent developments and outlook
As a result, many oil importers delayed buying oil from Russia. It is expected that
Russian oil exports would decline by about 2.5 million barrels per day. Currently, 
there are still uncertainties whether those sanctions would escalate further, 
particularly whether the EU would prohibit energy imports from Russia. In such 
case, Russian oil export would decline as much as 3.5 million barrels per day.
Nevertheless, it is expected that Russia would still be able to export oil to China 
because China would continue to trade with Russia and utilizes its own cross -border 
payment system. If one also takes into consideration the impact on Kazakhstan's 
oil exports of 1.6 million barrels per day that normally has to transits through 
Russia due to thecountry’s land -locked nature, the global oil supply might decline 
as much as 5 million barrel per day. 
Oil supply from other producers cannot fully offset the decline in Russian oil 
exports (Chart 2) due to lack of capacity to increase production both cyclically and 
structurally. With regard to OPEC countries who are the world’s top oil producers 
with sufficiently large oil output to offset the gap left by Russia, while they may 
have spare capacity to immediately scale up production by 2 -3 million barrel 
per day within a month, it is ultimately up to the OPEC’s decision whether they 
are willing to increase production beyond the agreed amount. Since 2021, the 
actual output from OPEC producers has been below the agreed amount because 
some countries faced political conflict on both domestic and international fronts, 
while fuel transport pipes were also damaged and often had to be shut down for 
unscheduled maintenance.

Note: SPR: The US and its allies’ strategic petroleum reserveSpecial issue 1: Global oil prices: recent developments and outlook
Iranian oil producers might be able to increase production by around 1 million barrel 
per day if sanctions imposed by the US were lifted. This could help partially offset 
the supply of Russian oil although negotiations are still ongoing and highly uncertain. 
The US Oil production is still increasing slowly and remains well below pre -COVID 
levels even though oil prices have risen sharply and are now above pre -COVID levels. 
The slow ramp up in US oil production is due to many US oil producers upholding 
their financial discipline by paying out dividends to their investors before investing in 
more production capacity. This is reflected in the reinvestment rate being much 
lower than in the past. US oil producers are also likely to delay investment in fossil 
fuel energy over the longer term as a result of President Joe Biden’s climate policies. 
Meanwhile, the release of the strategic petroleum reserve (SPR) by the US and its 
allies in the amount of 60 million barrel (around 2 million barrel per day) might be 
able to offset just 1 month worth of Russian oil. The limited increase in oil from both 
OPEC and US have tightened the global oil market as reflected in crude oil inventory 
among OECD countries which have continued to decline and has been below the 5 -
year average since 2021. 
In addition, oil demand is expected to continue recovering as reflected in the 
improving economic activities of major oil importers such as the US, India, and Germany. The growth outlook of these economies is looking more upbeat as the public grow less 
concerned over the Omicron outbreak. Likewise, the demand for oil for transportation 
purposes have also recovered as reflected in the higher number of commercial flights in 
operation. Many countries such as Norway, Sweden, and Japan are also preparing to lift 
international travel restrictions and re -open its borders to foreign tourists. 
Looking ahead, crude oil prices are likely to be more volatile and unpredictable
amidst tightening global oil market conditions that are more susceptible to both 
demand and supply factors, as well as the highly fluid situation surrounding the 
Russia -Ukraine conflict and sanctions against Russia. This presents an important 
challenge for macroeconomic policymakers in many countries, including Thailand, 
who must ensure that it would not have a significant impact on economic growth 
and inflation.

alliance led by the US and members of the European Union (EU) to retaliate with 
severe economic and financial sanctions against Russia. Not only did these developments
impact the Russian and Ukrainian economies, they also had unavoidable global 
repercussions and Thailand is no exception. The impact of the Russia -Ukraine conflict 
can be summarized under 3 main channels (Chart1) as follow:
(1)Energy and commodity prices: The Russia -Ukraine conflict directly affects
energy and commodity prices because Russia is a major producer and exporter of 
many key goods such as oil (10% of global oil export), pig iron (35%), palladium (25%),
nickel (20%), chemical fertilizers (13%) and wheat (8%). As such, commodities prices 
saw an overall increase when US and allies imposed sanctions against Russia . 
The S&PGoldman SachsCommodity Index (GSCI Index) increased as much as 17%1
from the week prior to the sanctions. Furthermore, the shortage of the aforementioned 
commodities might impact the production of goods across the global supply chain. 
Examples include palladium which is a key input in the manufacturing of car exhaust 
pipes and semiconductors, and nickel which is used in the production of stainless 
steel and EV batteries. 
1 Data from Refinitiv as of 3 March 2022Rising energy and commodity prices would impact the costs of producing 
goods and services as reflected by the producer price index (PPI). If businesses are 
unable to absorb those higher costs, they would pass it on to consumer prices as 
reflected by the consumer price index (CPI), resulting in higher inflation. Inflation in 
Thailand is expected to rise above the target range and peak in the second and third 
quarters of 2022 before gradually declining into the target range in the beginning of 
2023 (Every 10 USD/barrel increase in oil prices would see headline inflation rise by 
about 0.5%)2. Higher prices would hamper private consumption. On the other hand, 
higher costs mean less profit for the businesses which could subsequently impact 
private investment. On the whole, the slowdown in domestic demand from both 
consumption and investment may weigh on Thailand’s overall economic recovery.   
(2)Trading partners’ growth: The combination of the aforementioned impact 
on energy and commodity prices and uncertainties surrounding possible retaliations 
from either side affects many countries around the world, including those that are 
Thailand’s trading partners especially the euro area. The growth slowdown of trading 
partners would result in a decline in external demand which impacts the Thai economy
through 2 main channels:   
2A 10 USD/barrel increase in crude oil prices would also see GDP declining by 0.1% 
and the current account deficit increase by about 3.8 billion USD (or 0.8% of GDP)

(3)Financial Markets Severe sanctions initially resulted in a global risk -off 
sentiment . Investors sold off risky assets causing their prices to fall globally before 
rebounding after concerns among investors subsided. Likewise, the Thai stock market 
(SET Index) initially fell 5% and the baht depreciated 3%4. However, the overall 
impact has been limited partly because of Thailand’s strong external stability as 
reflected in the large international reserves and low external debt. The impact of the 
conflict on Thai mutual funds that invest in Russian equity and bond was quite 
limited because these funds account for only 0.3% of total investment of Foreign 
Investment Funds (FIF). There was also no sign of mass unit redemption in recent periods .

financial messaging service. More details can be found in the BOT’s Payment Insight

4Data as of 9 March 2022 compared with data as of 24 February 2022
5Data from Morningstar as of end -December 2021(2.1)Merchandise exports
The slowdown in trading partners’ growth leads to a slowdown in Thailand’s 
merchandise exports which would subsequently impact Thailand’s consumption, 
investment, and overall economic growth. If the impact on EU economies is severe, 
Thai exports would be impacted significantly because the EU is Thailand’s 4thlargest 
export market, accounting for 10% of total export value. Meanwhile, the direct impact on 
Thai exports to Russia and Ukraine would have limited bearing on overall growth 
because exports to Russia and Ukraine combined make up only 0.5% of total exports. 
(2.2)Foreign Tourists
TheRussia -Ukraine conflict would likely result inadecline inthenumber of2
groups offoreign tourists :(1)Russian tourists, which account forabout 4%ofall
foreign tourists arriving inThailand before thepandemic .Thedecline innumber of
Russian tourists maycome about asaresult ofsanctions imposed byWestern nations

The Thai Economy: Summary of Key Issues
The recovery in the labor market 
remains fragile and is not yet 
broad -based. Employment 
remains below pre -COVID levels 
and is recovering more slowly 
compared to past crises. The Thai economy will continue to 
recover. Sanctions against Russia 
will impact the Thai economy 
through higher energy and 
commodity prices but will not 
derail the overall recovery path. Headline inflation is on the rise, 
and is expected to rise above the 
target range in 2022 due to 
cost-push inflationary pressure 
before gradually declining back 
to the target range in 2023. 
25/72The Thai Economy
26/72Economic outturns in February and March 2022 suggest that domestic economic activity is largely stable 
despite high number of COVID -19 cases and rising death tolls.

30/72Overview of economic forecasts
Economic growth 
(%YoY)2022 2023
3.2 4.4
Private consumptionStrong private consumption growth will be driven by a continued recovery in 
economic activities and additional government measures. However, the pace will 
be slower than in the previous forecast due to higher cost of living as a result of 
the Russia -Ukraine conflict affecting energy and commodity prices, the prolonged 
COVID -19outbreak, and the phasing out of government measures. Private consumption will continue to recover after the pandemic and the 
Russia -Ukraine conflict subside, which will allow the tourism sector to recover 
and lead to improvements in both household income and purchasing power. 
Private investmentPrivate investment will expand in tandem with the expansion in merchandise exports and the gradual recovery in tourism. However, the pace will be 
slower than in the previous forecast due to increased uncertainties, the slowdown in domestic demand, and higher production costs impacting businesses’ 
profitability and investment decisions. 
Merchandise exports 
(Value)Merchandise exports growth will be stronger than previously assessed mainly 
due to the increases in prices especially of petroleum -related products. On the 
quantity side, the global supply chain situation has improved somewhat and 
manufacturing for exports has picked up as a result, but there remain downside 
risks stemming from the Russia -Ukraine conflict. Merchandise exports will continue to expand driven by higher export 
volume while the contribution from prices will be less given the expected
decline in crude oil prices. 
Foreign touristsForeign tourist figures remain unchanged from the previous assessment at 
5.6 million persons. While foreign tourist arrivals in the first quarter were higher 
than expected, foreign tourist arrivals throughout the remainder of the year might 
be somewhat affected by the sanctions imposed on Russia that will result in a 
significant lower -than-expected number of Russian tourists. Foreign tourist figures would see a strong rebound after the pandemic 
subsides. It is also expected that more countries would open up their 
borders, especially China. It is expected that foreign tourist figures would be 
around 19 million persons which is slightly lower than the previous 
assessment due to lower projected number of Russian tourists.
The Thai Economy
Private consumption is expected to recover but at a slower pace than previously assessed. 
Private consumption is expected to recover but at a slower pace than the previous assessment due to (1) higher cost of living from sharp price increases in 
some items which adversely affects consumer’s purchasing power and confidence, (2) the outbreak of COVID -19 Omicron variant whereby the number of new 
cases and containment measures in place continue to have some impact on economic activities even though vaccination progress have resulted in higher Mobility 
Index compared to the Delta outbreak, and (3) support from government measures phasing out going forward.

Merchandise exports volume (excluding gold) is expected to increase throughout the forecast period driven by 
stronger -than-expected external demand from trading partners in recent periods even after taking into account 
the adverse impact from the Russia -Ukraine conflict and sanctions against Russia. 
Tailwinds
•Global supply disruption had less -than-expected impact on the 
Thai economy. In particular, the shortage of electronic parts in the 
automobile, electronics, and electrical appliances industries has 
somewhat subsided since the end of 2021, thus allowing businesses 
to accelerate production and fulfill orders that were delayed earlier.
•The outbreak of COVID -19 Omicron variant had impacted trading 
partners less than expected. Furthermore, there are other supporting
factors such as the digitalization trends that would benefit exports of 
electronics and automobiles going forward. Some countries will also 
benefit from higher commodity prices. 
Headwinds
•The Russia -Ukraine conflict and sanctions against Russia would 
affect confidence and income of trading partners, especially European 
and Russian markets, as well as higher costs for exporters.

36/72Factors that would result in growth underperforming the baseline
• Global supply disruption might turn out to be more severe than expected. 
For instance, the Russia -Ukraine conflict could spread to other countries or be 
drawn out to the point that it results in shortage of inputs for some industries and 
merchandise exports.
• Cost of living might increase to the point where it impacts private consumption
especially if inflation is much higher than expected. Meanwhile, household income 
has not yet fully recovered. 
• The outbreak of COVID -19 might become widespread and have severe impact , 
orbecome more protracted than in the baseline. In such scenario, many countries
including Thailand might respond by implementing strict containment measures.
Factors that would result in growth outperforming the baseline
• Private sector spending might be higher due to pent -up demand.  Once the 
pandemic subsides, people with excess saving might become less concerned and 
spend more than previously assessed.There are risks that Thailand’s economic growth could underperform the baseline projections stemming from the shortage 
of inputs faced by certain industries which might be protracted, and the higher costs of living and doing business which 
could impact vulnerable households and businesses which are reflected in the downward -skewed fan chart.

37/72Average headline inflation for the first two months of Q1/2022 was higher than the previous quarter. The increase 
was mainly attributed to price increases in the energy, fresh food, and prepared food categories. 
Core inflation in the first two months of the first quarter of 2022 
averaged 1.16%, increasing from 0.27% in the previous quarter. The 
increase was attributed to higher prepared food prices from higher input 
costs, and higher prices of seasoning and condiments. Headline inflation in the first two months of the first quarter of 2022 
averaged 4.25%, increasing from 2.42% in the previous quarter. Energy 
price inflation was attributed to higher oil prices as a result of the 
Russia -Ukraine conflict as well as higher electricity costs from Ft adjustments
and the low -base effect from government subsidy to lower the costs of 
living in the previous year. Meanwhile , fresh food price inflation was 
attributed to meat prices, especially pork whose price was driven higher by 
decreased supply.

57% of businesses are unlikely to raise prices within 1 year. However, it is still 
necessary to monitor increases in input prices which may be larger than expected.Higher PPI/CPI indicates that there are more input costs 
that are waiting to be passed on to consumers.

•Businesses might pass on higher costs to consumer more than previously assessed if energy and commodity prices remain elevated for a long time. 
•Global supply disruption might turn out to be more severe than previously expected if the Russia -Ukraine conflict spreads to other countries or 
become drawn -out to the point that it result in shortages of some raw materials.
Factors that could result in lower inflation than the baseline
•The economic recovery might turn out to be more sluggish than the baseline forecast hence businesses are unable to raise prices because consumer

The2-year anniversary ofCOVID -19:How much hastheThai
labor market recovered?Special Issue 3Special issue 3:The 2 -year anniversary of COVID -19: How much has the Thai labor market recovered?
Over the next 1 -2 years, labor market conditions in Thailand would 
gradually improve in tandem with the overall economic recovery. However, 
improvements in labor market conditions would likely be fragile and 
not broad -based as reflected in non -farm income, which is expected to 
remain below pre -COVID levels in 2022 and 2023 (Chart 1) especially for 
those who are self -employed and workers in the service sector. This is due 
to both the slow recovery of the tourism sector, adaptation by both 
businesses and workers amidst large degrees of economic uncertainties, and 
demand -supply mismatches in the labor market. Details of these factors are 
as follow:
(1)Slow recovery of the tourism sector would impact the income 
recovery of the self -employed as well as wages and employment of 
workers in tourism -related services. While the latest BOT forecast projects 
foreign tourists arrival to be 5.6 million persons in 2022 and 19 million 
persons in 2023, those figures are only about half of the arrival seen during 
pre-COVID periods at 40 million persons. Furthermore, the recovery of the 
tourism sector remain highly uncertain and would be mainly be determined 
by the developments of the COVID -19 pandemic. As a result, the recovery 
in income and employment of both groups of workers is also highly 
uncertain.

Note: E = estimated
Source: Labor Force Survey and Economic and Social Conditions Survey conducted by the 
National Statistical Office of Thailand, calculated by the Bank of Thailand Billion baht(2)Businesses adapted by hiring less workers while COVID -19 uncertainties 
remain, resulting in less new hirings. It is expected that businesses, especially 
tourism -related services, would adapt by keeping labor costs down at least until 
there are no uncertainties related to COVID -19. Employers do so by increasing the 
number of working hours instead of hiring more workers. If there is a need to hire 
more workers, the employers would hire part -time workers instead of full -time 
workers because they are more flexible and less expensive. This is reflected in 
the employment figures in the fourth quarter of 2021 where employment in 
the service sector grew only about 1 percent from the third quarter even though 
the government had already relaxed containment measures and started permitting 
foreign tourists into the country. Meanwhile, employment in hotel businesses grew by 
about 10% but most of these were part -time workers. As a result, the ratio of part -
time to full -time workers increased from 16% to 18% in the third quarter of 2021. In 
addition, investment by manufacturing businesses have mostly been in automation to 
replace manual labor and thus did not contribute much to the number of new hiring. Special issue 3:The 2 -year anniversary of COVID -19: How much has the Thai labor market recovered?
(3)Workers adapted to the outbreak of COVID -19 as some workers decided
to move back home or to work in the informal sector.  As such, the recovery in 
income has been limited and remain below pre -COVID levels. Currently, around 
1.7 million workers have moved back to their home provinces are still reluctant to 
return to economic areas such as Bangkok and Phuket. This is due to many reasons 
such as uncertainties pertaining to the COVID -19 outbreak, wages being insufficient to 
cover living costs, and age limitations preventing workers from returning to the labor 
force. It is expected that most workers would move to the informal sector where 
productivity and labor income are low such as agriculture and self -employment . 
Workers who are out of jobs and have not yet returned home might also transition to 
the informal sector as well. This is reflected in the number workers in the agricultural 
sector and the self -employed in the fourth quarter of 2021 which increased by 5% 
and 4%, respectively, from pre -COVID levels. Meanwhile, workers in non -agricultural 
sectors declined by about 2%. 
Looking ahead, it is expected that some of the workers who returned 
back to their home provinces would return to work in economic areas if the 
sector they previously worked in has clearly recovered. Meanwhile, some of 
those workers might have returned back home permanently, especially the 
elderly and those with the capital or land ownership for starting a new career or a 
local farm. The income of this particular group of workers would likely remain below 
pre-COVID levels. 
49/72(4)Demand -supply mismatches in the labor market especially between 
the qualifications of the unemployed and the needs of the employers. Labor 
market data in 2021 indicates that some employers still need to hire additional 
employees as the number job vacancies did not decline (Chart 2). Some sectors 
were still hiring and likely to employ more workers to replace migrant workers who 
returned home. Meanwhile, workers found it more difficult to get a job as reflected 
in the number of long -term unemployment (workers who have been looking for a 
job for more than 1 year) which rose significantly (Chart 3) from 60,000 to 160,000 
persons in the fourth quarter of 2021. The number of those who are unemployed 
and never had a job before also increased to 270,000 persons, a number of which 
were new graduates who mostly hold a bachelors ’ degree. However, employers 
were looking for workers who do not have such high level of education.Special issue 3:The 2 -year anniversary of COVID -19: How much has the Thai labor market recovered?
The Beveridge curve represents the relationship between the unemployment rate and 
the vacancy ratewhich typically has negative correlations. During periods of economic 
slowdown, for instance, unemployment rate would increase while the vacancy rate would 
decrease. However, if the unemployment rate increases significantly while the vacancy
rate is largely unchanged (Beveridge curve shifted to the right), it indicates that there 
may be structural problems in the labor market preventing workers from taking up 
those job vacancies. In the second quarter of 2020, the Beveridge curve for the Thai 
labor market shifted to the right. This reflected the demand -supply mismatches in the 
Thai labor market whereby most job vacancies were for factory workers which do not 
require high level of education and were previously filled by migrant  workers, and thus 
was not attractive to those currently unemployed.

estimated by the Bank of ThailandChart 2: Relationship between unemployment

2016 -2019
2020 -2021Special issue 3: The 2 -year anniversary of COVID -19: How much has the Thai labor market recovered?
In summary, the recovery of wages over the next 1 -2 years would 
be held back by many factors. The slow recovery of the tourism sector 
would result in the slower recovery in wages of the self -employed and 
those in the service sector compared to other occupations. Meanwhile, 
adaptation by both employers and the employees amidst high economic 
uncertainties due to the COVID -19 outbreak, and demand -supply mismatches
in the labor market would both weigh on the recovery in employment and 
wages as well. As such, it would be necessary to closely monitor the recovery
in labor market given its significant implications for private consumption and 
the overall economic recovery, as well as financial stability going forward.

Impact ofinflation onhouseholds across different income groupsSpecial Issue 4Special issue 4:Impact of inflation on households across different income groups
Overall, the Thai economy is gradually recovering from its trough in 2020 and 
headline inflation is rising due to cost -push pressures. Detailed analysis shows that 
the recovery remains uneven across sectors and that the impact of rising inflation is 
also uneven between people of different income groups (double K -shaped recovery). 
In the recent period, inflation in Thailand rose sharply, especially in energy 
and food prices which saw a much larger increase compared to other goods with 
price increases for both fresh food and prepared food. While higher inflation would 
impact the cost of living for the whole population, the severity of the impact 
would vary across different households depending on their spending structure. 
For instance, households who spends a large share of their income on energy and 
food would be more affected in comparison. 
An analysis of household socio -economic data found that low-income 
households would face higher living costs from spending on food more so than 
high-income households. This is because the share of spending on food and 
non-alcoholic beverages among low -income households is as high as 46% of 
total spending, while the share of those same spending among high -income 
households is less than 30%. Meanwhile, the impact of higher energy prices is not 
so different between the two income groups. The share of energy spending for low -income
households and high -income households are similar at 10% and 13% of total spending ,
respectively (Chart 1).

elevated debt levels and their income not having fully recovered yet. 
About two -thirds of low -income households are indebted (Chart 2). Most 
low-income households are also self -employed or working in the service 
sectors which were directly impacted by the outbreak of COVID -19 and thus 
wages are recovering more slowly than other occupations.
All of the aforementioned factors hinder household purchasing power , 
especially low -income households which make up a large share of Thailand’s
population (60%) and account for one -third of total consumption spending 
(Chart 3). Not only do those factors affect the cost of living and quality of 
life of low -income households, they might also hold back private consumption
and the overall economic recovery in the period ahead. Special issue 4:Impact of inflation on households across different income groups

Monetary Policy
The MPC voted to maintain the 
policy rate at 0.5% to support 
a continued economic recovery Financial and fiscal measures
Measures should be well -targeted
with financial and credit measures
focusing on distributing liquidity 
and easing debt burden, and 
fiscal measures focusing on 
easing the cost of living and 
creating income . Financial conditions
Financial conditions remain 
accommodative overall, but 
have tightened due to 
heightened global financial 
market volatility recently.Financial stability
Pockets of vulnerability remain,
namely those pertaining to the 
balance sheets of households 
and businesses that continue to 
have high levels of debt. Monetary Policy Decision
Monetary policy: the MPC voted to maintain the policy rate to support the continuity of the economic recovery. 
The Thai Economy will continue to expand despite the impact from sanctions imposed on 
Russia through higher energy and commodity prices as well as a slow down in external demand. 
Meanwhile, the impact of the Omicron variant outbreak on economic activities is expected to be more 
contained than previous waves.
Headline inflation for the full year 2022 is expected to exceed the target range mainly due to energy 
prices. It is expected that headline inflation will peak in the second and third quarters of 2022 before 
gradually declining into the target range in early 2023 given that energy and food prices are unlikely to rise 
further. The recent pickup in inflation were mainly a result of supply -side pressure, while demand -pull
inflationary pressure remained low in line with wages which had just started to recover. 
Financial stability remains sound overall but household and businesses are still fragile due to 
elevated debt levels which would hinder economic growth in the period ahead. Therefore it is 
deemed necessary to push forth the implementation of debt restructuring measures that takes into 
consideration the debt repayment capacity of retail borrowers in the long –run in order to provide a 
more sustainable solution for the indebted. 
The MPC continues to place emphasis on the economic recovery in deliberating policy decisions . The MPC 
will continue to monitor factors that would affect the growth and inflation outlook including global energy and 
commodity prices, higher cost pass -through, and geopolitical tensions that could become more widespread and 
lead to more uncertainties going forward. The MPC stands ready to deploy additional appropriate monetary 
policy tools if necessary.0.50%MPC Meeting No. 1/2022

Private sector financing costs through both credit 
and the bond market remain low. The minimum 
loan rate (MLR) offered by commercial banks remain 
below pre -COVID levels. Meanwhile, new loan rates 
(NLR) as of January 2022 declined slightly from the 
previous month, especially for loan contracts larger 
than 100 million baht for businesses in utilities, hotels, 
passenger transportation, and commerce sectors. 
Short-term Thai government bond yields remain close
to the policy rate and did not move in tandem with US 
Treasury yields. Meanwhile , long-term government 
bond yields increased from the previous quarter, in line
with movements in its US and regional counterparts. 
The increase is attributable to expected hikes in the 
Federal Funds Rate which might happen sooner and 
faster than expected, as well as rising inflation due to 
higher energy and commodity prices. However, higher 
long-term government bond yields would have limited
impact on businesses because most corporate bonds 
issued have maturity of less than 5 years.Private sector financing costs through both credit and the bond market remain low. Long -term government bond 
yields edged up but had limited impact on businesses’ ability to obtain financing.

Latest data on BOT’s debt 
assistance programs (in Thai)
In the fourth quarter of 2021, large corporates (credit limit > 500 million baht) 
were still able to obtain financing . Corporate loans grew across many sectors, 
especially manufacturing and commerce partly because these sectors are linked to 
exports and the outlook for exports has improved. Corporate bond issuance also 
expanded with most issuers being businesses in the manufacturing, media and 
communication. These issuances were mainly driven by the need to roll -over existing
debt and the need for more working capital.
SME loans (credit limit ≤500million baht )saw continued improvements supported 
mainly by the soft loan facility. Businesses that received financial assistance from 
the facility were mostly businesses in commerce and manufacturing sectors. 
For the first quarter of 2022**,it is expected that credit demand would continue 
to grow across all sectors given financing needs for working capital purposes, exports , and 
investment in fixed capital which are in line with the ongoing economic recovery.

•In the first quarter of 2022, the baht averaged 33.05 baht per U.S. dollar, an appreciation of 1% from the previous quarter. The baht ’s movements during 
this period have also been volatile due to increased uncertainties. The baht appreciated in the early parts of the quarter as confidence improved over the 
opening of Thailand ’s borders to foreign tourists under the Test & Go program, which eased investors concerns and led to capital flows returning to Thai financial 
markets. However, the baht depreciated sharply in March due to ( 1) the Russia -Ukraine conflict which escalated and is likely to be drawn out and ( 2) faster -than-
expected policy rate hikes by major central banks. 
•The nominal effective exchange rate (NEER)averaged 116.8 , a 1.9% appreciation from the previous quarter mainly due to the depreciation of the euro and the ruble.The baht appreciated in the early parts of Q1/2022 on account of the recovery of the tourism sector and subsequently depreciated 
after the Russia -Ukraine conflict erupted.

62/72Risks pertaining to heightened global financial market volatility have increased but the impact of the Russia -Ukraine 
conflict on Thai financial markets has been limited so far. This is because not many Thai mutual funds invest in 
the Russian market and the risk of capital reversals from Thailand remains low.
Thai Foreign Investment Funds (FIF) have limited investment in 
Russian and European markets. There is also no evidence of 
mass unit redemptions that should be of concern thus far.

therefore necessary to push forth the implementation of debt restructuring measures that bring about a sustainable
