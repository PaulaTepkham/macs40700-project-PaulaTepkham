The Monetary Policy Report  is prepared quarterly by staff of the 
Bank of Thailand with the approva l of the Monetary Policy Committee 
(MPC). It serves two purposes: (1) to communicate to the public the 
MPC’s consideration and rationales for the conduct of monetary policy, 
and (2) to present the latest set of economic and inflation forecasts, based 
on which the monetary policy decisions were made.

1.1 Growth and inflation prospects  
The Thai economy was likely to experience 
continuous growth, while inflation pressure was 
poised to pick up.  
The Thai economy was expected to 
expand continuously with private demand 
remaining the main engine of growth,  backed by 
strong supporting factors including accommodative 
monetary and fiscal conditions. In 2013, the MPC 
assessed that overall private demand would moderate towards the normal trend, after having 
accelerated sharply in the previous year. Although 
private demand was likely to moderate slightly from previously assessed, higher  public stimulus and 
gradual recovery in exports following trading partners’ 
economic recovery would help support overall The Thai economy was expected to  experience continuous growth 
throughout the projection period. Domestic  demand would still benefit from private 
consumption and investment momentum spurred by vari ous supportive factors. 
Meanwhile, public spending was expected to  have an increasing role in economic 
growth, while exports were likely to reco ver gradually in line with global economic 
conditions. Inflationary pressure was poi sed to pick up gradually going forward, 
consistent with improvements in t he domestic economy and higher-than-expected 
global oil prices.  
Given the fragile state of the global economy and domestic financial 
stability risks, the MPC judged that an accommodative monetary policy stance 
remained appropriate. The MPC thus voted to  hold the policy rate  at 2.75 percent 
per annum in its last two meetings.

next periods. Given that underlying economic factors 
and major economic assumptions had not changed 
much, the MPC assessed that the overall Thai economic momentum would lik ely remain similar to 
that previously expected.  Nevertheless, a slight 
upward adjustment on econom ic growth projection 
was made to reflect the higher-than-expected growth 
in 2012 Q4, which raised t he forecast base, as well 
as higher public stimulus (Chart 1.1 and Table 1.1) . 
 
 
  
 
  
 
Fragile recovery of the global economy, in 
particular the euro area and the US, remained the 
main risk that could cause the Thai economy to 
expand less than the baseline projection. Nevertheless, the MPC assesse d that this risk did not 
change significantly from the previous assessment 
due to progress in the resolution of the euro area’s sovereign debt problems and US fiscal problems. 
Meanwhile, the situations in Italy and Cyprus were 
expected to be a short-term risk factor and should not develop into a systemic risk in the financial sector 
going forward. At the same time, upside risks from 
domestic factors  increased  from greater clarity 
regarding the 2 trillion baht investment in 
infrastructure, which could be disbursed at a faster Table 1.1 Forecast summary

MPC assessed that risks to ec onomic growth in future 
periods would become balanced as opposed to that 
skewed downwards in the previous projection. The fan chart for growth was thus balanced throughout the 
projection period (Chart 1.2) .
  
Inflation was likely to remain stable. 
Inflationary pressure in the short-term could be 
somewhat lower than expect ed, as reflected by the 
inflation outcome in 2013 Q1 which was lower than assessed, particularly ra w food prices. However, 
going forward, the MPC deemed that demand 
pressure would likely increase gradually in line with the domestic economic trend. Meanwhile, cost 
pressure was likely to pick up slightly from the 
previous assessment, due to higher global oil prices than previously assumed. As a result, the baseline 
projection for inflation remained relatively unchanged 
(Table 1.1) . Going forward, the MPC assessed that 
risks to inflation would slight ly tilt towards the upside. 
Inflationary pressure from shortage of labor and other 
production factors which coul d pass through to prices 
at a greater extent duri ng economic expansion would 
warrant monitoring. Fan charts  for inflation were thus 
skewed upwards slightly, compared to those that 
were previously balanced (Charts 1.3 and 1.4) .

Momentum from robust domestic demand 
should continue, while the ex port sector would recover 
gradually in tandem with improving global economic 
outlook. 
The Thai economy was expected to expand 
continuously.  
The Thai economy was likely to grow 
continuously, fueled mainly by private demand  
thanks to strong supporting factors including 
accommodative fiscal and monetary conditions. In 2013, private demand would moderate toward its 
normal trend after having accelerated sharply in the 
previous periods. Momentum during the beginning of the year could weaken somewhat from the previous 
assessment. Private consumption was poised to slow 
down slightly due to discontinued acceleration in automobile spending despit e strong consumption 
growth in other categories. Business sector 
investments were likely to be more gradual, albeit still on an up-cycle trend. In the meantime, the MPC 
assessed that fiscal stimul us would be higher than 
last projected and would play a larger role in economic growth in 2013 t han previously assessed. 
This was due to the slight increase in budget 
spending
 and the incorporation of the 2 trillion baht 
infrastructure investment project into the baseline 
case. The increase in fisc al stimulus would help 
sustain domestic demand growth going forward (Chart 1.5 and Table 1.2) .

With regard to the external sector, the 
MPC assessed that merchandise exports were 
likely to recover slowly, in line with global economic recovery. Exports were expected to play 
a larger role as engine of growth in late 2013 and 
support economic growth momentum when government stimulus meas ures tapered off. At the 
same time, the MPC assessed that imports would 
likely soften from the previous  projection, in line with 
lower-than-expected investm ent growth prospects of 
the business sector. Meanwhile, overall exports were 
likely to remain similar to the previous assessment, in part from anticipated high growth in the tourism 
sector. As a result, net exports would lend greater 
support to economic growth than previously assessed.  
Given insignificant changes in economic 
factors and major economic assumptions, the MPC assessed that momentum of the Thai 
economy would be similar to that assessed 
previously (Chart 1.5). However, economic outturns 
for 2012 Q4, especially pr ivate consumption and 
public spending, were mu ch higher than expected, 
raising the forecast base and slightly lifted up growth 
forecast in 2013. Neverthele ss, this upside effect was 
reduced by a weaker-than- expected outlook of Table 1.2 Forecasts for GDP and components

Economic projections for 2013  were thus adjusted up 
only slightly. For 2014, ec onomic projections were 
also adjusted upwards from last time, partly due to the anticipated increase in fiscal spending which 
would help shore up domestic demand growth going 
forward.     
The global economy to recover gradually  
As expected, the global  economy recovered at 
a slow pace, with some downside risks in the short run. 
Thailand’s trading partners’ economies 
were expected to recover slowly throughout the projection period (Chart 1.6) , with a possible 
temporary slowdown  in early 2013. This was partly 
due to weaker momentum from the US and euro area economies continuing from 2012 Q4 which exhibited 
lower-than-expected economic growth. However, for 
the rest of the projecti on period, the MPC assessed 
that Thailand’s trading partners’ economies would  
recover slightly faster than previously expected, thanks 
to improvements in Japan’ s economic outlook from 
more concrete stimulus m easures, gradual recovery of 
the US economy and cont inued expansion of the 
Asian economies.   
The outlook for euro area economies 
weakened from the previous assessment (Chart 
1.7). Economic momentum in  the first half of 2013 
was expected to be softer than previously assessed. 
This was due to the great er-than-expected economic 
contraction in 2012 Q4 of the euro area, as a result of 
weaker exports. In addition,  uncertainties of the 
situations in Italy and Cypr us during the start of the 
year could somewhat affect economic activities in the 
short run. Overall, however, euro area economies 
were expected to return to  the previously projected 
recovery path in late 2013, led by the recovery of the export and manufacturing se ctors, especially in 2008 Q1

improvement. Meanwhile, fiscal austerity measures 
and the tightening credit c onditions by financial 
institutions would conti nue to constrain domestic 
demand recovery going forward. Risks to the euro 
area in the next periods di d not change significantly 
as there was some progress in resolving sovereign debt problems and the situati ons in Italy and Cyprus 
were expected to be only temporary and would not 
develop into a systemic risk in the financial sector. The euro area’s economic growth assumption in the 
worse case scenario thus remained nearly 
unchanged.  
At the same time, the US economy was 
likely to improve gradually going forward (Chart 
1.8). US economic momentum  in 2013 was lower than 
previously projected, due to weaker-than-expected 
economic conditions in 2012 Q4. However, looking 
ahead, the MPC assessed that  the US economy would 
be supported by the likel y increase in private 
consumption and investm ent, as well as gradual 
improvements in labor mark et conditions. This would 
help offset most of the im pact from sequestration that 
will come into effect in Ma rch 2013. Nevertheless, fiscal 
problems would continue to hamper recovery going forward, particularly from uncertainties regarding the 
debt ceiling. There is a possibility that the US 
government may consider  compensating the debt 
ceiling increase with a further reduction in fiscal deficit, 
which could affect confidenc e and economic activities of 
the private sector.    
Japan’s economy showed signs of stability 
with a promising outlook going forward (Chart 
1.9). The new government’s stimulus measures 
became more concrete, both the supplementary 
budget of around 2 percent of GDP and the 
continuous accommodative m onetary policy stance to 
help pull the Japanese economy out of deflation. The Left axis:           Jan 13 (baseline)    Right axis:     Change in baseline

-28    Monetary Policy Report  April 2013  MPC assessed that impacts from the measures would 
gradually pass through to the real economy in the next 
periods, which would help support economic recovery 
in Japan. Meanwhile, the export sector would gain support from global demand recovery and the weaker 
Japanese yen. 
In addition to the likely pickup in the 
Japanese economy, the Chinese and other Asian 
economies were also poised to grow strongly 
(Chart 1.10)  on the back of robust private demand 
supported by accommodative fiscal and monetary 
conditions. Furthermore, ex ports of the regional 
economies started to show  signs of improvement, 
particularly in electronics. On the other hand, signs of 
financial stability risks in the real estate sector and 
lending in some countries  became more apparent. As 
a result, many economies started to implement 
measures to maintain ec onomic stability during this 
period. 
The Thai export sector picked up gradually,  
in line with the global economy.    
The Thai export sector started to stabilize and 
would recover gradually towards the end of 2013. 
Meanwhile, imports decelerated in line with a gradual 
pace of private investment. 
The export sector was still affected by the 
weak global economy. However, it started to show signs of stabilization in the beginning of 2013 and 
was likely to pick up steadily (Table 1.3). Latest 
data from the first two months  of the year exhibited a 
slowdown in merchandise exports, particularly in 
automobiles, electronics, as  well as agricultural and 
fishery products. This coul d lead to lower merchandise 
export in 2013 Q1 than previously assessed, but 
should recover close to the previous projection trend  
in late 2013. The recovery would be in line with (1) gradual recovery of trading partners’ economies  2008 Q1

improvements in key leading indicators, such as the 
manufacturing production index, new export orders, 
and the semiconductor book-to-b ill ratio. However, the 
MPC assessed that export growth in the future periods 
may not be as high as in  the past because major 
economies were likely to expand below normal trends for some time. This would cause some exporters to 
turn more to the domestic market. Furthermore, due to 
domestic labor shortage problems, more businesses 
moved their production base to neighbor countries.  
     
 
At the same time, merchandise imports in 
2013 were expected to expand continuously (Table 1.3). Imports of consumer goods likely increased in 
line with strong demand fo r consumption and robust 
income outlook. Imports of  capital goods would benefit 
from industrial upgrading trend to replace manual labor 
and the government’s large ‐scale investment projects. 
However, compared to the previous projection, the 
MPC appraised that merchandi se imports would slow 
down slightly on the ba ck of lower-than-expected 
reconstruction in early 2013 and a slow increase in capital goods imports which we re likely to stretch over 
the medium to long term. 
With regard to currency risks, the MPC 
evaluated that it could cause some impact but 
would not hamper overall export momentum. The

currencies during the beginning of the year Tabl e  1.3 Forecasts for the external sector

However, the impact was un likely to be significant 
because some exporters  had expected the baht 
appreciation and had hedged against it. Meanwhile, the weaker Japanese yen was also unlikely to affect 
Thai exports on the w hole as the resulting 
improvement in Japanese expor ts would in turn help 
boost Thai exports of inte rmediate goods and parts in 
the supply chain. Further more, the Thai economy 
would benefit from cheaper imports of machineries from Japan, to enhance pr oduction efficiency going 
forward. 
The MPC assessed that the current account 
balance
1 was likely to show a lower surplus going 
forward (Table 1.3)  owing to higher imports in line with 
recovery of the export sect or, business investments and 
public investments in large ‐scale infrastructure projects. 
Nevertheless, the current account projection for 2013 
increased from the previous projection due mainly to expansions in the tourism sector.  
Momentum from privat e demand would continue. 
Private consumption and investment were 
expected to expand conti nuously, although slowing 
down towards the normal trend after having 
accelerated strongly in the previous periods.  
Private consumption was likely to expand 
continuously and would be the main engine of economic growth in Thailand throughout the 
projection period. The MPC assessed that, with 
existing supporting factors and a larger role of public spending, private consum ption in 2013 would expand 
more than previously proj ected, although the actual 
economic outturns indicat ed that consumption of 
durable goods had already accelerated sharply 
during the end of last year  and there were signs of 
                                                        
1 Including reinvested earnings  Monetary Policy Report  April 2013                              11 deceleration during the start of  this year. Factors that 
continued to help bolster t he momentum of private 
consumption included (1) im proved purchasing power 
following favorable income prospects owing to the increase in minimum wage and civil servant salary, 
restructuring of the personal income tax rate, as well 
as a likely increase in farm income due to the rising trend of the prices of key agricultural products, such 
as rubber, palm oil and cassava following the 
increase in global demand, wh ile price of rice would 
still be supported from the government’s rice pledging 
scheme; (2) accommodativ e monetary policy which 
supported household credit growth; and (3) healthy consumer confidence st emming from government 
stimulus measures and a stable inflation trend.  
The MPC expected that overall consumption 
would decelerate to its normal trend.  Spending on 
consumption may not accele rate as before, partly due 
to the discontinuation of so me public measures, front-
loaded acceleration of durabl e goods consumption in 
the previous periods and debt burden of households 
which could cause consumers to become more money 
conscious.  
Private investment should expand further, 
with its up-cycle trend to continue.  In 2013, 
investments were expected to  grow close to the long-
term average, owing to investments by businesses to 
accommodate high demand for goods and upgrading and restructuring of it s manufacturing production 
process to replace labor s hortage. However, the MPC 
assessed that the business sect or would likely invest at 
a gradual pace stretching over the medium to long term 
which could cause investm ents to moderate towards 
the normal trend faster than expected. The MPC 
appraised that many suppor tive factors remained 
strong, in particular (1) bus inesses remained confident 
in the Thai economy and were likely to invest according 
to their long-term plans, as reflected by high levels of 12    Monetary Policy Report  April 2013  application and issuance of investment promotion 
certificates by the Boar d of Investment (BOI) and 
foreign direct investments spreading over various 
industries, (2) overall m onetary conditions remained 
supportive, with a broad-based corporate loan 
expansion, and (3) long-term  public investments in 
infrastructure were more concrete and would crowd in private investment going forward.   
Some key risks to private investment 
needed monitoring . These included (1) the labor 
shortage problem which was the main constraint on 
capacity expansion and could cause some businesses 
to move production to neighbor  countries. Tight labor 
market conditions persi sted and were reflected 
through the higher vacancy to unemployment ratio and 
business surveys which indicated that labor recruitment was a major drawback for businesses. (2) 
Profit margin of businesses which were affected by the 
minimum wage hike and the appr eciation of the baht in 
previous periods. This coul d put constraints on short-
term investment decisions, especially for SMEs that 
did not hedge against foreign exchange risks and industries with low natural hedge. And (3) fragile 
recovery of major indus trialized economies, which 
could affect investment dec isions of export-oriented 
industries.  
Continuous fiscal stimulus 
Fiscal stimulus was likely to increase in the 
following fiscal years. 
Fiscal policy would continue to provide 
economic stimulus going forward  as reflected by 
the increasing trend of fiscal deficit
 which was 
relatively high in proportion to GDP. The budget deficit 
for fiscal years 2013 and 2014  were expected to stand 
at 300 and 250 billion baht, respectively. Meanwhile, 
non-budgetary expenditures were likely to increase over the projection period (Chart 1.11) .   -5-4-3-2-1012

from the previous projection (Table 1.4). Budget 
expenditures were expected to rise slightly from the 
increase in funds  from fiscal year 2012 in line with 
actual disbursement dat a. Meanwhile, non-budgetary 
expenditures were also likely to increase. The MPC 
also incorporated government spending under the 2 trillion infrastructure projec t into the baseline case, 
with gradual disbursements expecting to commence 
in the beginning of fiscal year 2014. At the same time, investments in water management declined due 
to the slight downward adju stment in the amount of 
fund and the postponement of some spending on this project to later fiscal years,  to be consistent with the 
latest project details and data on the government’s 
disbursement plan.  
 
 
  
 
  
 
The MPC deemed that non-budgetary 
spending as well as contingent obligations from quasi-
fiscal activities via specialized financial institutions 
(SFIs) warranted monitoring, as they could put constrain on future fiscal policy implementation and 
could affect sovereign debt prospects and fiscal 
position in the long run.

Source: Bureau of the Budget and calculation by Bank of Thailand14    Monetary Policy Report  April 2013  Inflationary pressure was likely to pick up.  
Inflationary pressure should remain relatively 
stable during the start of the year, but was likely to 
pick up gradually going forward. This was consistent with the improving trend of  economic conditions and 
the higher-than-expected world crude oil prices. 
Risks to inflation were slightly skewed upwards. 
Inflationary pressure should pick up going 
forward, with demand pressure likely to increase steadily in tandem with the economic outlook.  
The MPC assessed that household spending would 
still gain support from favo rable income prospects 
and accommodative fiscal and monetary conditions. 
Meanwhile, businesses were likely to invest 
continuously to accommodat e demand for goods and 
to upgrade their manufacturing production process. 
Public spending on large ‐scale infrastructure 
investments also became more concrete. The gradual increase in demand pressure was consistent 
with the output gap becomi ng slightly positive in 
future periods (Chart 1.12) , though the output gap 
would still remain close to zero over the projection 
period.   
Cost pressure was likely to increase 
slightly from the previous projection, in line with 
higher global energy prices at the start of the 
year. The MPC adjusted upwards the baseline 
assumption on the Dubai oil price to stabilize at 110 
US dollars per barrel in the beginning of 2013 from 
the previous assumption of  105 US dollars per barrel 
(Chart 1.13).  This adjustment was on account of 
intensified geopolitical conf licts in the Middle East 
and North Africa, increased global demand for crude oil following US economic recovery, as well as China 
and Japan’s economic stimul us measures. Overall, 
however, world oil prices were expected to remain stable throughout the proj ection period. The MPC 
assessed that both the demand-side and supply-side 2011 Q1

Apr 13 (low case  0.5 S.D.)Monetary Policy Report  April 2013                              15 fundamentals were balanced and thus set high and 
low case assumptions on the Dubai oil price to be at 
half a standard deviation above and below the 
baseline path. With regard to domestic oil prices, the MPC continued to assume the diesel excise tax 
exemption throughout the projection period.  
Meanwhile, cost pressure in other areas 
was not yet a concern. World non-fuel commodity 
prices (Chart 1.14)  were expected to expand at a low 
level throughout the projection period, similar to that previously assumed as demand and supply 
conditions remained un changed. Assumptions on 
domestic fresh food prices were also similar to the previous assessment (Chart 1.15) . On the one hand, 
fresh meat and seafood prices  were likely to rise in 
the short-term from a surge in shrimp prices following a disease outbreak. On the other hand, this was 
offset by a drop in veget able prices stemming from 
favorable weather conditions which led to more-than-expected production. Rice  price remained stable. 
Looking ahead, the MPC judged that 
upside risks to inflation would outweigh downside risks slightly  because (1) there was a greater chance 
that shortage of labor and other production factors 
could put further pressure on inflation. The cost pass-through could be higher going forward given lower 
profit margins of businesses together with favorable 
consumer spending prospects that would encourage upward price and (2) geopolitical conflicts in the Middle 
East and North Africa could create additional pressure 
on world oil prices. Neve rtheless, downside risks to 
inflation also existed including weaker private 
consumption than projected in the baseline case 
should global economic recovery be slower than that previously assessed.

Apr 13 (baseline)  assumptions16    Monetary Policy Report  April 2013  Risks to economic stability 
Overall economic stability remained sound. 
However, there remained risks emanating from rising 
household debt and more prevalent investments in risky assets. 
Against the backdrop of strong Thai 
economic prospects, there started to be some 
signs of imbalance buildup in the economic 
system, which rendered close monitoring to prevent 
it from affecting the overall Thai economy. Going 
forward, monetary policy im plementation would have 
to be weighed carefully between these risk factors and economic and infl ation prospects. 
Once source of risks to financial stability 
stemmed from persistently high consumer credit growth,  especially in auto leasing and other personal 
loans. This led to an increase in household debt and 
could cause financial vulner ability in the household 
sector going forward. Although households’ debt 
servicing ability remained inta ct, as reflected by a low 
delinquency ratio, there began to be signs of increasing stress in delinquencies for some loan 
types. The MPC thus deemed it necessary to 
continue monitoring hous eholds’ debt creation and 
debt servicing ability.  
Supportive economic and monetary 
conditions encouraged investments in risky assets, as reflected by high expansions in the 
stock and real estate markets during the recent 
periods. The stock market started to display signs of 
speculation, partly reflected by a surge in trading 
activity by domestic retail investors which were found 
to mostly speculate on sm all stocks. Meanwhile, both 
demand and supply in the real estate market was 
expected to expand continuously, particularly in large 
provinces where land and house prices were likely to rise steadily in line with increasing purchasing power Monetary Policy Report  April 2013                              17 and urbanization. Some areas started to see more 
housing unit reservati ons for the purpose of 
investment and speculati on than in the past. Real 
estate activities in Bangkok  and its vicinity also rose. 
The MPC assessed that real estate risk would 
warrant monitoring as it could affect economic 
activities broadly and would take time to recover.  
Alternative scenarios 
The MPC appraised that there were various 
scenarios where Thai economic growth could deviate from the baseline case. T he MPC thus took these 
scenarios into consideration to reflect key risk factors 
on the Thai economy and inflationary pressure going forward. 
Scenario 1: The global economy recovered 
slower than assessed.  Although uncertainties in the 
global economic system clearly declined in the recent 
period, global money markets were still susceptible to short-term situations. There was also a possibility that 
economic problems could spread out and protract. The 
MPC appraised that the global economy could recover slower than the baseline case should (1) austerity 
measures in the euro area affect demand more than 
expected, and problems in Cyprus spillover to Greece and other countries, (2) fiscal stimulus in the US 
decline and affect economic activities by more than 
expected and (3) Japan’s stimulus measures fail to achieve the target. Under these conditions, the MPC 
assessed that the Thai economy would expand lower 
than expected in the baseline case due to the following reasons. (1) The export sector would be directly 
affected by weakening global demand and its recover 
would be pushed back to be later than the baseline projection at end-2013. (2) The corporate sector could 
delay investment decisions. And (3) given excess 
liquidity in the global market, economic problems outside the region could encourage capital flows into 
the region and exert upward pressure on regional 18    Monetary Policy Report  April 2013  currencies, including the baht. Although the stronger 
currency could encourage imports and partly reduce 
inflationary pressure from imported inflation, it would 
also have an adverse effect on export value in baht terms. 
Scenario 2: Fiscal stimulus could be higher 
than expected  if the government was able to 
disburse the 2 trillion baht infrastructure investment 
project as planned. In t he baseline case, the MPC 
appraised that disbursement s, especially during the 
beginning of the project, would not be as high as 
planned by the government. If the government was 
able to disburse in accordance to its target plan, then economic growth in 2014 could be higher than 
projected in the baseline case, due to the direct 
increase in public investment and its positive effects on private investment and confidence.    
Under the first scenario, the MPC appraised 
that a continuation of an accommodative monetary 
policy stance would be appropriate. The MPC would take a wait and see appr oach and could postpone 
interest rate normalizati on for some time. For the 
second scenario, further fisc al stimulus could cause 
domestic production factors to tighten and exert additional pressure on inflati on. This could instigate 
earlier policy interest rate hikes than assumed in the 
baseline case going forward.   
         Monetary Policy Report  April 2013                              19 1.3 Monetary policy decision  
 Monetary policy stance remained accommodative. 
 The MPC deemed the current accommodative 
policy rate appropriate given fragile global economic conditions and domestic financ ial stability risks. The 
MPC thus voted to maintain the policy rate in its last 
two meetings.  
 In its meeting on Febr uary 20, 2013, the MPC 
assessed that the global  economy became more 
stable and exhibited stronger  signs of improvement 
compared to the previous meeting. However, risks from lingering resolution of the euro area’s sovereign debt problems and uncertainty regarding US fiscal consolidation remained.  In 2012 Q4, the Thai 
economy expanded more t han expected and would 
likely grow at a higher rate  than previously assessed, 
with domestic demand remaining the main engine of growth. In addition, exports were expected to recover gradually, while inflationary pressure increased somewhat from the previ ous meeting on the back of 
higher oil prices. T he MPC deemed that the 
accommodative monetary policy stance in the 
previous periods contribut ed to sustained growth of 
the Thai economy, while infl ation remained within the 
target range. However, unc ertainties surrounding the 
global economic outlook and risks to domestic financial stability from rising asset prices remained. The MPC thus voted 6 to 1 to hold the policy rate at 
2.75 percent per annum, with 1 vote in favor of a 0.25 percent cut to mitigate risks from capital inflows and still fragile economic moment um. Going forward, the 
MPC would continue to closely monitor risks to financial stability and the capi tal flow situation, and 
stand ready to take appropriate policy actions as warranted. 
 20    Monetary Policy Report  April 2013   In its subsequent meet ing on April 3, 2013, 
the MPC assessed that  the global economy 
continued to recover gradually. However, tail risks had edged up somewhat since t he last meeting, as 
financial crisis in the euro area could exacerbate 
economic contraction. Although the US economic 
outlook had improved, fi scal sequestration weighed 
on growth. Meanwhile, the Japanese economy displayed signs of improv ement thanks to monetary 
and fiscal policy stimulus. The Thai economy was projected to moderate toward the normal trend in 2013 Q1, after accelerating in the previous quarter. In the periods ahead, domesti c demand should continue 
to be a key engine for growth. Fiscal stimulus should also gradually pick up pace in the second half of this year from public invest ment in flood management 
and large ‐scale infrastructure projects, lending further 
impetus to private invest ment. Exports should expand 
slowly, in line with global economic conditions. Meanwhile, current inflation remained within the target, but potential upward pressure from supply constraints and higher labor costs would warrant monitoring. The MPC judged that, given the fragile state of the global econom y, continuation of an 
accommodative monetary policy stance remained 
appropriate. However, risks to financial stability, including volatile exchange rate and capital flows, were a concern. The MPC thus voted 5 to 1 to 
maintain the policy interest  rate at 2.75 percent per 
annum, with one member voting for a cut in the policy rate by 0.25 percent per annum (one MPC member was unable to attend the m eeting due to obligations 
abroad). The MPC would cont inue to closely monitor 
domestic economic developments as well as risks to financial stability, and stand ready to take appropriate 
policy action.

Percent2013 201424   Monetary Policy Report  April 2013    What are the determinants of c apital inflows to Thailand? 
 The issue of capital inflows, particularly inflows into the bond and stock markets, is 
currently receiving much attention given the recent sharp increases in their size and speed. In this 
regard, many are concerned about their consequenc es including the volatility of the flows 
themselves and the exchange rate, which could negatively affect the country’s economic and 
financial stability. 
 In the past, many studies of determinants of  capital flows have relied on two types of 
economic variables as follows; (1) pull or dom estic factors such as gross domestic product, 
inflation, and interest rate differential; and (2) push or external factors such as global economic 
growth and liquidity in major industrialized financ ial markets. However, changes in the global 
environment since the latest global economic cr isis and the euro area’s sovereign debt problems 
have shifted the view and behavior of  investors. Specifically, in a world of volatile capital 
movements and exchange rates, investors are highly sensitive to global uncertainties and tend to 
take more short-term speculativ e positions. Therefore, a study of  capital inflow determinants that 
only takes into account data on investment  returns and economic fundamentals may prove 
inadequate. Factors that reflect expectation and sentiment on risks should also be considered. 
Determinants of capital inflows into the Thai stock market1/ 
This article studies determinants of capital inflows into the Thai bond and stock markets 
using flow data on net purchase of the Thai baht fo r equity investment by financial institutions and 
other foreign investors. This dataset is a more accurate measure of capital inflows for the purpose 
of this study than balance of pay ments data which was often used in prior studies because it is a 
record of actual payments on a cash basis. Theref ore, this dataset can reflect new flows to the 
country as well as exchange rate pressure more  accurately than balance of payments data which 
records ownership changes between residents and nonres idents without any regard to actual cash 
settlements. 
An important assumption in this study is that investors seek high returns but dislike risks. 
Thus, they consider factors such as returns on investment in stocks and bonds, interest rates, and 
exchange rate expectation. A regression analysis  is performed using data from July 2007 to 
September 2012. The regression uses eight independent  variables that can be classified into two 
groups as follows; (1) macroeconomic variables, including the Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), 
the Business Sentiment Index (BSI), policy interest rate differential between Thailand and the US , 
Thai unemployment rate, and Thai inflation; and (2) variables reflecting investors’ sentiment, 
namely VIX index, expected Thai baht appreciation and Thai baht implied volatility.2/  
The study found that changes in investors’ s entiment on risks, expect ed volatility of the 
Thai baht and Thai inflation had negative effect s on foreign inflows into the bond and stock 
markets. On the other hand, ex pected growth of the Thai ec onomy, expected baht appreciation 
and changes in policy interest rate differentia l between Thailand and the US had positive effects 
on inflows (Table 1 Model A) . The results are consistent with t he intuition that foreign investors 
seek high returns from (1) interest rates; (2) cor porate profitability that is expected to be healthy in

Chidchanok Annonchan published on the Bank of Thail and’s website on March 4, 2013 (in Thai).  
2/ Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) is a survey of final production  of major businesses which reflects global economic growth. 
 Business Sentiment Index (BSI) is a survey  of businesses which reflects businesses’ view on Thailand’s expected economic growt h

 Implied volatility of the Thai baht reflects expected volatili ty of the Thai baht based on information from foreign options ma rkets Monetary Policy Report  April 2013    25 line with a strong economy; and (3) speculation on the Thai baht, while risks and volatility are 
shunned by investors.   
However, it is interesting 
to note that the results were not  
consistent with the theory of 
interest rate parity, which explains 
investors’ behavior based on their beliefs that assets of two countries 
are perfect substitutes such that 
they will always invest in assets with higher return. In other words, 
this study does not
 find that policy 
interest rate differential between Thailand and the US was the key 
determinant of inflows into the 
stock market. However, changes in investors’ sentiment on risks 
and changes in policy interest rate 
differentials do matter. Further regression analysis f ound that the 
level of Thai and US interest rates 
have very small coefficients and are not statistically significant 
(Table 1 Model B) . 
This study also analyzed 
the relative contribution of the 
explanatory variables that were 
statistically significant. A statistical method of computing relative 
importance was applied to the 
results and we found that the sentiment variables, namely 
changes in investors’ sentiment on 
risks and expected Thai baht appreciation, were mo re statistically important in determining 
movements of foreign capital into the Thai bond and stock markets than macroeconomic variables 
(Table 2) .  
Conclusion and policy implication  Capital inflows into the Thai bond and st ock markets depend on many variables, both 
economic and sentiment variables. With regard to im plementation of the interest rate policy, the 
study suggests that reducing Thailand’s interest ra tes in an effort to deter foreign inflows would 
render only a small and short-term effect. This is because investors are responsive only to new 
information. The findings implied that if the in terest rate differential between Thailand and the US 
was left unchanged in the next periods and all other economic variables remained the same, foreign investors would not change their investment  position. This means that, holding everything 
constant, the effect of a policy rate cut on capita l inflows would last for only one period. Therefore, 
policy makers need to carefully weigh the benefits of a policy interest rate cut to stem inflows in the 
short-term against the costs of negative effects fr om a possible inconsistency between the level of 
policy rate and the economic conditions. Table 1 Coefficients of determinants of capital inflows

2.1 The global economy  
The US economy was expected to improve 
on the back of strong pr ivate consumption and 
investment growth, thanks to improving employment 
conditions and clearer signs  of recovery in the 
housing sector. Fiscal problems, however, remained 
a key risk to the economy. 
In 2012 Q4, the US economy overall 
remained unchanged from the previous quarter. 
(Chart 2.1)  owing to two offsetting factors. On the 
one hand, public spending cont racted, especially on 
national defense  and inventory accumulation. But the 
contraction in these cat egories were expected to be 
temporary. On the other hand, growth in private 
consumption and investment accelerated, with much 
clearer signs of recovery in housing sector investments and some incipient signs of a pickup in  
corporate investments.  The world economy recovered gradually  on the back of an improvement 
in private consumption and investment in the US, as  well as Japan’s economic 
stimulus measures and strong domestic demand growth in China and Asian 
economies. Nevertheless, euro area ec onomies remained weak on the back of 
political uncertainty in Italy and the financia l crisis in Cyprus which likely affected 
financial markets and economic reco very in the short run.   
The Thai economy in 2013 Q1 was ex pected to moderate towards the 
normal trend after a strong acceleration in the previous periods. Economic 
fundamentals and confidence re mained intact, contributi ng to a continuation in 
private spending and investment growth. At the same time, fiscal stimulus 
continued to lend support to domestic dem and, while the export sector improved 
slowly in line with gradual global economic recovery. Current inflation remained in 
the target range. However, inflationar y pressure from supply constraints and 
higher labor costs warranted monitoring.

Percent (Seasonally adjusted, annualized)28                          Monetary Policy Report  April 2013  In 2013 Q1, the US economy was likely to 
recover gradually spurred by improvement in private 
consumption as re flected by high automobile sales 
and retail sales growth. Higher employment contributed to this mo re positive outlook (Chart 2.2) , 
despite the increase in the personal income tax rates 
and payroll tax since January 2013. Meanwhile, private investment was likely to increase thanks to 
continual recovery in the real estate sector and 
improving business confidence. 
The MPC assessed that  the US economic 
outlook would likely improv e in the next periods, led 
mainly by the increasing tr end of private consumption 
and investment. However, fiscal sequestration 
remained the main constr aint on economic growth. 
Going forward, uncertainti es regarding the debt ceiling 
remained, and there was a po ssibility that the US 
government would have to further reduce the budget 
deficit in future periods. Prolonged and unclear resolution of the fiscal problems could affect business 
and household confidence and hence could delay 
private investment and spending. 
Euro area economies remained weak and a 
slow recovery was expected in 2013. Political 
uncertainty in Italy would affect economic recovery 
but only in the short run,  while risks to the economy 
increased from Cyprus’ approach to resolve its 
financial crisis. 
In 2012 Q4, the euro area economy contracted 
by 0.6 percent from the previous quarter (Chart 2.3)  
owing to a contraction in  exports from the global 
economic slowdown. In additi on, private consumption 
and investment weakened due to investors’ and 
consumers’ concerns over the impact from intensified 
sovereign debt problems in Greece and Spain.  
In 2013 Q1, the euro area economy was 
expected to contract, albeit at a lower rate, from the 
previous quarter on the back of  a lower contraction in 036912

while exports to countries  both outside and within the 
euro area improved. Moreover, in the first quarter, 
producer and consumer c onfidence in the economy 
increased from the previous quarter (Chart 2.4) . 
Meanwhile, political issues in Italy could have short-
term impacts on euro area economies, but would not 
develop into a systemic risk. This issue, however, 
would be closely monitored.   
The MPC appraised that euro area 
economies in the first half of 2013 were likely to 
weaken more than expect ed, before recovering 
slowly in the latter half of the year. Risks to the euro area increased on the back of Cyprus’ approach to 
resolve its financial crisis which raised concerns by 
other member states that  the euro area authorities 
could also enforce this  type of measure should 
problems in the financial sector arise in their 
economies. 
The overall Japanese economy remained 
weak, but exhibited si gns of stabilization. 
Improvement in economic performance was expected 
in future periods support ed by government stimulus 
measures and the recovery  of trading partners’ 
economies. 
In 2012 Q4, the Japanese economy remained 
more or less unchanged from the previous quarter, 
after a contraction of 0.9 percent in the third quarter 
(Chart 2.5) . Key positive contri bution stemmed from 
private consumption, par ticularly in non-durable 
goods, and public spending fo llowing the additional 
stimulus measures from the remaining fiscal year 
2011. 
In 2013 Q1, Japan’s economy remained 
weak, but started to show signs of stabilization as 
reflected by an increase in export volume in January 
and February in line with trading partners’ economic 
recovery and continued improvements in producer 708090100110120

fiscal stimulus measur es and the accommodative 
monetary policy stance in Japan. To help pull the 
Japanese economy out of def lation, on January 22, 
2013, the Bank of Japan adjus ted the inflation target 
(excluding raw food) to st and at 2 percent from the 
previous target of 0-2 percent, and announced an open-ended asset purchase program at a pace of 13 
trillion yen per month,  beginning January 2014. 
The MPC appraised that the Japanese 
economy would recover slowly on the back of 
continual support from gov ernment policies through 
additional fiscal spending and a more accommodative monetary polic y stance. These would 
help improve corporate performance and private 
confidence, which would lend support to the real 
economy in the periods ahead. 
Chinese and most Asian economies were 
likely to continue to expand well given strong domestic demand growth, while exports would 
recover gradually. 
In 2012 Q4, most Asian economies improved 
from the previous quarter (Chart 2.6)  following strong 
growth in domestic consum ption and investment as 
well as healthier exports. 
Regional economic activi ties in 2013 Q1 were 
likely to expand continuously , with consumption and 
investment remaining the main engine of growth. In addition, exports improved gradually, especially 
exports of electronics which recovered in tandem with 
the global electronics cycle. 
The MPC assessed that regional economies 
would continue to expand we ll, mainly supported by 
strong domestic demand. Furthermore, exports were expected to improve gradually in line with global 
economic recovery and r obust economic expansion 
in China which potentially  had large influence on the Chart 2.6 Contribution to Asia’s economic growth

In 2012 Q4, the Chinese economy grew year-
on-year by 7.9 percent, driven mainly by domestic demand, both from robust private consumption and 
investment, as well as cont inued recovery in exports 
after experiencing a slowdown in the first half of 2012 (Chart 2.7) .   
In 2013 Q1, China’s economic activities, 
including consumption, investment, production and 
exports, continued to expand strongly. Nevertheless, 
signs of imbalances in the r eal estate sector started 
to emerge as reflected in accelerating housing prices 
that had been rising continuous ly for several months 
during the beginning of 2013. As  a result, on March 1, 
2013, the government announc ed further tightening 
measures in an attempt to st abilize prices in the real 
estate market.  
Going forward, the MPC judged that the 
Chinese economy would expand steadily, driven by 
the increasing role of dom estic demand, as well as 
continuous infrastructure investments by the public 
sector, while support from the export sector remained 
strong.  
2.2 The domestic economy  
 In 2012 Q4, the Thai economy expanded from 
the previous quarter, dr iven mainly by continued 
strong growth in domesti c demand, both consumption 
and investment of the privat e and public sectors. This 
was partly due to fiscal stimulus measures, in particular the first-car tax rebate scheme. Moreover, 
gradual recovery of the gl obal economy drove exports 
and export-oriented manuf acturing production to 
increase from the previous quarter.

In the fourth quarter, the seasonally adjusted 
economic growth rate for T hailand stood at 3.6 percent 
from the previous quarter  (Chart 2.8) due mainly to 
expansions in the manufactu ring and services sectors. 
Compared with the previ ous quarter, seasonally 
adjusted manufacturing production  rose by 6.9 
percent, consistent with re covery in export-oriented 
production. The hard disk drive industry recovered in line with external demand, wh ile the integrated circuit 
industry began to increase production after the flood 
problems subsided. Meanwhile, production for domestic consumption remai ned strong, in particular 
automobile production which gr ew exceptionally well in 
response to a surge in car orders incentivized by the first-car tax rebate scheme.  Furthermore, production of 
the petroleum industry ro se once an oil refinery 
resumed production after it was shut down for repairs due to a fire in the previous quarter.   
The services sector  expanded continuously at 
2.3 percent from the previ ous quarter, on the back of 
strong growth in the trade sector following domestic 
demand conditions. This in turn , led to expansion in the 
logistics sector. The construction sector grew both in the private and public sector. Construction of the private 
sector was mainly for the purpose of production 
capacity enhancement and invest ments in real estate 
projects in Bangkok and other  large provinces, while 
construction of the public se ctor was carried out by both 
the central and local governm ents. The tourism sector 
grew satisfactorily in tandem with a surge in the number 
of foreign tourists. As a consequence, ot her tourism-
related services such as hotel, restaurant and 
transportation, also expanded well. 
Seasonally adjusted agricultural outputs  
contracted from the previ ous quarter by 3.1 percent,

monetary conditions c onducive to borrowing. 
Meanwhile, private invest ment declined 0.3 percent 
from the previous quarter after having accelerated in the 
previous quarters to repl ace and repair flood-related 
damages. Nevertheless, investments in machinery and 
equipment, as well as in c onstruction remained high. 
Gradual recovery of the global economy led 
exports of goods and services  to expand by 3.1 
percent from the previous quarter, attributable to an 
increase in manufacturing exports, namely automobiles, metal products , electrical appliances 
and electronics. Exports of agr icultural products also 
increased in line with export volume of rice and rubber. Meanwhile, exports of services continued to 
expand from the previous quarter following a surge in 
foreign tourists, particularly from Russia, China and Malaysia, which was partly due to the reopening of 
Don Mueang Airport in October 2012. Furthermore, 
freight receipts and other transport receipts rose in tandem with higher international trade volume.  
Robust domestic demand and gradual 
improvements in exports led imports of goods and 
services  to expand by 5.2 percent from the previous 
quarter, thanks to a broad-based expansion in 
imports. The increase in imports was particularly observed in capital goods including machinery and 
equipment, and aircrafts, as well as imports of raw 
materials and intermediate goods, such as parts of both electronics and electric al appliances. This was 
consistent with gradua l improvements in export-
oriented production. Impor ts of services also 
increased from the previous quarter from freight 
payment which rose in line with international trade 
volume, and passenger transport payments following an increase in the number of Thais travelling abroad.   Monetary Policy Report  April 2013                      35 The public sector  continued its role in 
stimulating the economy, as reflected by an 
expansion of public spendi ng from the previous 
quarter, in particular investments in durable assets by the Royal Irrigation Depart ment, the Department of 
Highways and the Department of Rural Roads. 
The economic outlook for 2013 Q1
1/ 
In 2013 Q1, the Thai economy was likely to 
expand slightly from the previous quarter.  
Private consumption and in vestment were expected 
to moderate towards the normal trends after having 
accelerated strongly in the previous quarters. 
Meanwhile, economic fundamentals remained healthy. Fiscal stimulus would continue, while exports 
should improve in line with  gradual global economic 
recovery. The manufacturing sector was expected to remain unchanged from the preceding quarter due to 
shortage of raw materials in the food industry and 
capacity constraints in the automobile industry as it 
was already operating at full capacity since the end of 
last year. Nevertheless, the services sector was 
expected to grow conti nuously consistent with 
expansion in the trade, tr ansportation, construction 
and tourism sectors. 
                                                        
1/ Economic indicators used in assessing the outlook for 2013 
Q1 were produced by the Bank of Thailand, except data on the Manufacturing Production Index and capacity utilization 
rate, which were provided by  the Office of Industrial 
Economics. The number of tour ists and the occupancy rate 
were, in part, compil ed by the Tourism Authority of Thailand. 
Data on the labor market were obtained from the National Statistical Office. The governm ent expenditure data were 
provided by the Comptroller General’s Department, which compiled by the Fiscal Policy Office , the Ministry of Finance. 
Economic outlook were obtained from the Economic/Business 
Information Exchange Program between the Bank of Thailand and business sector .
 36                          Monetary Policy Report  April 2013  Manufacturing production  in 2013 Q1 was 
expected to remain stable compared to the previous 
quarter, constrained by from raw material shortages. 
The frozen seafood industry experienced shortage in shrimps due to disease out break problems. Sugar 
production was also likely to decline as a result of 
lower sugarcane output in this harvest season. 
Moreover, the automobile industry was already 
operating at full capacity in  the previous quarter and 
thus could not increase production until capacity-
enhancing investments were completed. Export-
oriented production was expected to recover 
gradually in tandem with global economic conditions. 
The hard disk drive industry was likely to expand 
slightly, while overall produc tion of integrated circuits 
declined following sluggish global demand, except for electronic parts used in smartphones and tablets 
which expanded robustly (Chart 2.9) . Stable 
manufacturing production l ed the capacity utilization 
rate in the first quarter to re main similar to that in the 
previous quarter (Chart 2.10) . 
The services sector  in the first quarter overall 
was expected to expand well in line with the trade, 
transportation, construction and tourism sectors. 
Wholesale and retail sales, and freight were expected to increase strongly in tandem with domestic 
consumption. Meanwhile, the construction sector 
should continue to expand robustl y as a result of both 
public investments, such as the mass rapid transit 
system, and private investments such as the new 
automobile factory and investments in the real estate sector which were likely to expand in various provinces 
on account of higher purchasing power and 
urbanization. The tourism sector continued to grow robustly as reflected by the number of tourists and the 
seasonally adjusted hotel occupancy rate which rose 
steadily, especially tourists from China and Russia (Chart 2.11) . 1030507090110130150170190

likely to contract from the previous quarter. This was 
due to a decline in rice output as farmers expected a 
drought during the end of last year and hence quickly harvested to prepare for the new round of off-season 
planting. As a result, rice out put in this quarter was less 
than usual. Meanwhile, rubber output was also likely to decline due to unfavorable weather conditions. 
The labor market  was expected to remain 
tight in the first quarter, c onsistent with the Business 
Sentiment Survey
2/ which found that firms 
experienced recruiting difficulties, with the problem 
expecting to intensify goi ng forward. Consequently, 
the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate remained 
low (Chart 2.12) . Furthermore, the implementation of 
the second-round minimum wage hike to 300 baht per day, affecting nationw ide, on January 1, 2013, did 
not yet lead to a significant increase in 
unemployment. This was partly because businesses had already made adjustments to mitigate impacts 
from higher labor costs
. At the same time, although 
some businesses had laid off workers, part of these workers were able to find new jobs as most 
businesses still increased hiring. This was consistent 
with the Business Sentiment Survey which found that 
most businesses, in bot h manufacturing and non-
manufacturing industries, planned to increase 
employment in the next 3 months. 
For the demand side, in 2013 Q1, private 
consumption and investm ent were expected to 
expand from the previous quarter. Meanwhile, exports would recover at a gradual pace, in tandem 
with a still weak global economic recovery, while the 
public sector would continue to lend support to economic growth. 
Private consumption was expected to grow 
at a rate close to its normal trend, as reflected by a rise in the Private Consum ption Index in January and 0.00.20.40.60.81.01.2

attributable to favorable household income and 
employment conditions which helped increase 
purchasing power and cons umer confidence. Fiscal 
and monetary policies also played a role in 
supporting expansion in priv ate consumption. This 
included the first-car tax rebate scheme, personal 
income tax rate cut, the nationwide minimum wage 
hike to 300 baht on January 1, 2013, the extension of 
the rice pledging scheme, as  well as the continuation 
of an accommodative monet ary policy stance.  
Private investment  was also expected to 
expand, but at a lower rate than the normal trend after having accelerated strongly in the previous 
periods. This was reflected in a slight decline in the 
Private Investment Index in January and February 2013 (Chart 2.14) . Nevertheless, investments in 
construction as well as  machinery and equipment 
remained at a high level and were likely to increase further in order to replace manual labor in response 
to the wage increase and the labor shortage problem, 
as well as to accommodate higher domestic and foreign demand anticipat ed following a closer 
regional economic int egration under the ASEAN 
Economic Community (AEC). As reflected by high levels of application a nd issuance of investment 
promotion certificates by the BOI, foreign investors 
continued to show their in terest in investing in 
Thailand due to strong c onfidence in the Thai 
economic outlook as well as monetary conditions 
conducive to seeking funds.    
Exports of goods and services  were 
expected to expand slightly fr om the previous quarter in 
tandem with gradual recovery of the global economy (Chart 2.15) . Exports of manufacturing products, 
especially automobiles, hard disk drives and electrical 
appliances were expected to decelerate from the previous quarter. Meanwhile, exports of agricultural and 120125130135140145150155160

raw material shortage, particularly shrimp for frozen 
seafood production, as well as deteriorating price 
competitiveness which should cause a slowdown in rice exports. Nevertheless, exports of services were 
expected to continue to expand from the previous 
quarter, in tandem with an increase in the number of foreign tourists from almost  every region, especially 
China.  
Imports of goods and services were likely to 
decelerate (Chart 2.16)  with a slowdown in the imports 
of raw materials and intermediate goods, especially 
fuel, and a deceleration in the imports of capital goods after having accelerated in the previous periods. 
However, imports of consumer goods, including 
vehicles and parts were likely to grow strongly, in line with expansion in private spending and recovery in 
exports. Meanwhile, imports of services were also 
expected to increase from intellectual property expenditures and insurance and pension payments, as 
well as financial service payments following economic 
improvements.   
Fiscal stimulus was likely to continue in the 
first quarter (Chart 2.17)  as reflected by an increase 
in budget disbursement, from both current expenditures, especially in wages and salaries, and 
purchases of goods  and services
, and investment 
expenditures in durable assets, such as investments for flood rehabilitation and pr evention, as well as 
investments of the Departm ent of Highways and the 
Royal Irrigation Department.  
In summary, the Thai economy in 2013 Q1 
was poised to expand from the previous quarter on 
the back of increases in domestic spending, tourism and exports of goods and serv ices in tandem with 
gradual improvements in manufacturing production. 507090110130150

 Inflation 
 Headline inflation in 2013 Q1 stood at 3.09 
percent, slowing down slightly from 3.23 percent in 
the previous quarter (Chart 2.18) , consistent with a 
slowdown in core inflation and energy prices. Energy 
prices in 2013 Q1 increased by  8.76 percent from the 
same period last year, decelerating sharply from 
14.79 percent observed in the previous quarter due 
to a high base effect. The high base effect came from 
elevated domestic retail oil prices in the same period 
of last year following the reintroduction of the oil fund levy and higher world crude oil price from tight global 
supply. Nevertheless, compared to the previous 
quarter, domestic retail oil prices in this quarter increased in line with world crude oil prices.  
 Prices of raw food rose by 6.08 percent 
compared to the same period last year, accelerating sharply from 2.92 percent recorded in the previous 
quarter, due to price increases in meat, poultry, 
aquatic animals and eggs. T he price increases arose 
from (1) the relief of the excess supply problem and 
(2) higher demand for consumption during the 
Chinese New Year festival . However, prices of 
vegetables and fruits declined from the previous 
quarter on account of favorable weather conditions 
which helped increase output.  
 Core inflation in 2013 Q1 stood at 1.47 
percent, moderating from  1.82 percent in the 
previous quarter owing mainly to the slowdown in prepared food prices (Chart 2.19)  due to the high 
base effect.

There had not been signs of unusually high 
pass-through of higher costs from the minimum wage hike in January 2013 to pric es of goods and services 
in 2013 Q1. This was reflected in the quarter-on-
quarter core inflation which was close to the 5-year average rate (Table 2.2) . 
Production cost conditions 
Continuing from the prev ious quarter, overall 
costs of production in 2013 Q1 remained low, as 
reflected by an increase in  the Producer Price Index 
of 0.1 percent, moderating from 0.9 percent recorded 
in the previous quarter (Chart 2.20) . This followed a 
deceleration in the price of agricultural products, 
mainly vegetables and fruit, after more output entered into the market. In addition,  the price of petroleum 
products contracted due to t he high base effect from 
high world crude oil prices on the back of tight global 
supply in the previous year.

Inflationary pressure was likely to build up 
slightly in the future periods, mainly from domestic 
demand pressure. 
(1) Demand pressure was likely to increase in 
line with robust economic growth, in particular private 
consumption and investment  which were the main 
engine of growth, as well as gradual export recovery.  
(2) Going forward, cost pressure was likely to 
remain stable compared to the current level, in tandem with prices of o il and commodities in the 
world market. Nonetheless, strained factors of 
production, especially labor , could cause costs of 
production and inflationary pressure to accelerate in 
the periods ahead.   
(3) Inflation expectati ons remained stable as 
reflected by the 12-mont h ahead inflation expectation 
in February 2013 of 3.5 percent which remained 
unchanged from the previous month (Chart 2.21) . 
Risks to inflation that would warrant close 
monitoring going forward included the effects of the 
minimum wage hike and the impact of the energy price restructuring on inflat ion, which could be higher 
than assessed.  Chart 2.21 12-month ahead inflation expectation

The origin of and the ne ed for budget sequestration: 
Budget deficit has been a 
chronic problem1/ for the US 
economy. The need to borrow to 
fund the deficits have led to a persistent rise of public debt, 
which spiked sharply after the 
global fi nancial crisis in 2008 when 
government stimulus measures 
were needed to shore up the 
economy (Chart 1) . This ongoing 
budget deficit problem has begun 
to affect long-term fiscal stability. 
With this concern, the US congress has become more cautious in approving debt ceiling increase in respond to the rise in 
sovereign debt. For the latest debt ceiling in crease in 2011, the US congress enacted a 
Budget Control Act on August 2, 2011, which st ipulated a condition for the US government to 
formulate a long-term plan to reduce the budget deficit by Nove mber 23, 2011 in exchange for 
a debt ceiling approval. Failure to do so woul d result in an automatic budget cut, so called 
“sequestration”. 
The US government turned out to fail to meet  the budget cut by the set deadline due to 
disagreements on revenue and expense measur es of the two main political parties. 
Therefore, budget seque stration of 1.2 trillion US dolla rs was activated for 2013-2021, 
effective from March 1, 2013 onwards.
2/  
Details of budget sequestration  
In FY 2013, the US governm ent will need to reduce the over all budget by 85 billion US 
dollars, equivalent to 2.3 percent  of the 2013 annual budget, or 0.6 percent of GDP. Most of 
the cuts would be on discretionary spending, in cluding 43 billion US dollars on defense and 
31 billion US dollars on other b udgetary expenses. M eanwhile, cuts on ma ndatory spending 
of 11 billion US dollars will be targeted at M edicare expenses. Howe ver, other mandatory 
spending, such as social security and Medi caid will be exempted from the budget cuts. 
                                                 
1/  Average revenue and expense to GDP between 1950-2008 registered at 18.0 and 19.8 percent, 
respectively. In 2012, the figures were approx imately 15.8 and 24.0 percent, respectively. 
2/ Budget sequestration has been pos tponed from its former deadline on January 2, 2013 to March 1, 2013 
as a result of a deal reached on the fiscal cliff problems.  Source: World Economic Outlook Database October 2012, IMFChart 1 US public debt to GDP

Budget sequestration would ultimately affe ct the US economy in 2013 but it would not 
cause the US economy to contra ct or enter into another recession due to the following 
reasons.  
(1) The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has assessed that even with a 85 billion 
US dollar budget cut, actual spending on the real economy that would be reduced would  only 
amount to 42 billion US dollars because (i ) some government depa rtments and agencies 
would be able to disburse from the previ ous fiscal year’s committed budget; and (ii) in 
general, some of the allocated budget  would not be fully disbursed.  
(2) Despite the abruptness of the budget cu t, reduction in actual spending would be 
gradual. Government department s and agencies will gradually  cut spending and postpone 
some expenses in a sequential manner. For example, new employment in the government 
sector would be postponed to be after a reducti on in work hours for existing workers have 
been done. In this way, affected parties would ha ve time to adjust and hence the impact of 
budget sequestrati on could be eased. 
(3) There have been improvements in t he US economic outlook whereby private 
demand, particularly c onsumption, business investment and real estate investment, have 
edged up. Such improvements would by and larg e help support the economy, compensating 
for lower government spending.  
Risks in the periods ahead  
Fiscal problems remain the key risk to t he US economy in the long run given that 
mandatory spending is on the ri se in tandem with the aging population. Nevertheless, an 
immediate problem that t he US government must deal with is  the issue of debt ceiling that has 
been temporarily suspended by a Congressional ruling until May 19, 2013. Should the US 
government fail to find a solution to this problem , there is a risk that the economy would slow 
down further due to (1) a deterioration in priv ate sectors’ sentiment; (2) a potential downgrade 
by rating agencies due to government’s default ri sk; and (3) another possible spending cut to 
reduce the deficit further in exchange for an incr ease in the debt ceiling as was the case in 
2011.3/ 
In conclusion, though the budget sequestrati on would have some adverse effect on US 
economic growth but it would hel p improve the country’s fiscal  stability in the long-term. 
Nevertheless, risks to fiscal stability will re main with the US economy in the foreseeable 
future. The challenge now faced by the US governm ent is to find a timely solution to its fiscal 
problems, as well as to strike the balance bet ween short-term growth and long-term fiscal 
sustainability. 
                                                 
3/ On August 2, 2011, US congress approved an increase in  the debt ceiling of 2.1 trillion US dollars (from 
14.3 trillion US dollars to 16.4 trillion US dollars) in exchange for a reduction in the deficit of 2.1 trillion US 
dollars within the next ten years. 45   Monetary Policy Report  April 2013  
 Appreciation of the Thai baht and its implication on exports  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
The rapid appreciation of the Thai baht since the beginning of  this year has led to 
concerns about its impact on T hailand’s export sector whic h had been an important engine of 
growth for the Thai economy. However, our st udy reveals that Thai exports depend mainly on 
the economic condition of trading partners. As for a case in  point, in 2010 when the Thai baht 
appreciated by 9.6 percent agains t the US dollar, Thai exports  still grew strongly at 27.0 
percent during that year (Chart 1) . Moreover, despite trend appreciation of the Thai baht, the 
share of Thai exports in total world exports has increased over time from 1.1 percent in 2005 
to 1.3 percent in 2012 (Chart 2) , reflecting improving competit iveness of Thai businesses. 
However, even though the recent appreciation 
has not significantly 
affected overall export volume, the impact of 
baht strengthening on 
corporate income and profitability in Thai baht 
terms cannot be 
disregarded. Profits of Small and Medium 
Enterprises (SMEs) in 
particular, have been greatly affected. 04000800012000160002000024000

 In the past, Thai exporters have adjus ted well to changing demand conditions and 
currency appreciation, as reflec ted by continued growth in ex ports amid the global economic 
crisis and strengthening of the baht. Businesses have diversified to new markets instead of 
just using pricing strategy  to compete. There has been greater use of non-US dollar 
currencies for settlements. There has also been im provement in product s ophistication of Thai 
export products which should hel p foster the exporters’ bargai ning and market power. Finally, 
businesses have also been hedging against exchange rate risks. All these adjustments have 
allowed Thai exporters to weather through the impact of exchange rate vo latility. Details are 
as follows. 
             (1) Seeking new markets and diversifying away from US dollar settlements:  Exporters 
have diversified to new markets including ASEAN, India and the Middle East instead of relying 
only on major markets such as the US , the euro area and Japan where demand has been 
slowing. To reduce income volatility from exchange rate movements, exporters have also 
been diversifying settlement currenc ies instead of solely relying on the US dollar as in the 
past, with an increase in transactions denom inated in Thai baht. This trend has been 
consistent with the expansion of exports to ASEAN mark ets, especially Cambodia, Laos, 
Myanmar and Vietnam (Chart 3) . 
(2) Change in industrial structure:  In recent years, Thailand has been shifting away 
from producing low value-added products such  as textiles, shoes and food to more 
sophisticated products with hi gher value-added such as autom obiles, chemicals and steel 
products (Chart 4) .

 (3) Hedging against 
exchange rate risks  by undertaking forward transactions in various currencies especially the US dollar : There has 
been a recent increase in hedging activities by exporters to protect themselves against the exchange rate risks. The proportion of forward transactions to total exports has increased from 24.8 percent in 2005 to 43. 8 percent in 2012. 
(4) Resorting to 
natural hedge:  Despite 
some adverse impact of the Thai baht appreciation on exports, exporters have also been able to reap benefits by importing  capital and intermediate goods at lower costs.  In particular, businesses with high import content such as those in automobile and petroleum industries would potentially be marginally affected by the Thai baht appreciation. 
On the other hand, businesses with low natur al hedge such as furniture, jewelry and food 
industries would be more significantly affected as they mainly relied on domestic factors of 
production (Chart 5) . 
In summary, although Thai exporters’ income  and profitability in Thai baht terms have 
been affected by the recent baht appr eciation, on the other side of the coin this would provide 
an opportunity for businesses to import machinerie s and capital goods at lower costs. In this 
regard, productivity can be enhanced thereby helping businesse s deal with other more 
structural problems of labor shortages and higher minimum wage.  This will help improve long-
term competitiveness of Thai businesses and su stainably support Thai exports in the future. 02468101214

Money market rates remained close to the 
policy interest rate. Government bond yields were 
somewhat volatile due to demand factors and global financial market conditions. The stock market index 
rose over this period though the market became 
rather volatile towards the end of the quarter. Meanwhile, the Thai baht appreciated as a result of 
better financial market sentim ent driven by improved 
global economic conditions  and Thailand’s strong 
fundamentals.

In 2013 Q1, short-term money market rates 
remained stable and close to the policy interest rate 
at 2.75 percent per annum as the MPC’s decided to Thailand’s overall economic and financia l stability was well maintained.  
Improvement in global financia l market sentiment improved,  partly as a result of 
the agreement to avert the US fiscal cliff and positive US  economic data, 
contributed to higher demand for bonds and equi ties in Thailand by both domestic 
and foreign investors. The Thai stock mark et exhibited higher vo latility during this 
period owing to concerns over the Thai baht and uncertainties surrounding 
Cyprus’ financial problems. St ability in other sectors, nam ely financial institutions, 
household, corporate, real esta te and fiscal, remained sound. 
Key risks to be monitored in the next periods included (1) the increase in 
retail investors’ speculative activities; (2) the expansion in c onsumer loans which 
remained high, particularly auto leasings ; (3) effects of the baht appreciation on 
corporate profitibility; and (4) impacts of the high growth of  provincial real estate 
markets, rising construction costs, together with labor  shortages, on the 
construction sector out look and house prices.

January 9 and February 20 meetings. The overnight 
interbank lending rate and the one-month government 
bond yield stood at 2. 65 and 2.67 percent, 
respectively, at the e nd of the quarter. At a 
subsequent meeting on Ap ril 3, 2013, the MPC 
continued to hold the policy interest rate at 2.75 percent per annum, causing s hort-term interest rates 
on April 3, 2013 to remain close to the 2013 Q1 end 
level (Chart 3.1) .  
Short-term government bond yields in 2013 
Q1 edged lower owing to an increase in demand by 
both domestic and foreign investors. Medium- to long-term government bond yields, however, increased in 
January thanks to improved global financial market 
sentiment partly as a result of  the US fiscal cliff being 
averted and better-than-expected economic data, 
especially employment and real estate data. 
However, anticipation of a policy interest rate cut by some investors in February coupled with a continued 
rise in yields during the la st 4-5 months resulted in a 
return in demand, which in turn caused bond yields to decline. Towards the end of  the quarter, medium- to 
long-term government bond yields moved in tandem 
with the US government bond market and the gradual 
increase in foreign investors’ holding of long-term 
government bonds (Chart 3.2) .  
Equity market 
The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) Index 
in 2013 Q1 was somewhat volatile, especially in 
March due to concerns over the Thai baht and uncertainties surrounding Cypr us’ financial crisis. In 
this regard, the SET I ndex increased continuously 
since the beginning of the quarter in line with increasing foreign investors’ and institutional 
investors’ demand (Chart 3.3) . However, towards the 
end of March, the SET Index fell sharply by 119.16 2.652.903.153.403.653.90

Key risks to be monitored in the periods 
ahead included the potential increase in retail investors’ speculative activi ties since the beginning of 
the year. Signs of spec ulations were evident 
especially on small stocks, which could give rise to the risk of a stock market bubble (Chart 3.4) . To curb 
such risk, the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) and 
the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced a list of securities with abnormal trading 
patterns that were required to trade using cash 
balance account. Under this measure, investors must 
deposit cash in their trading account in full before 
they could start trading. The period required for cash 
trading for stocks on this cash basis list was also extended to six weeks from three earlier. The list of 
stocks that investors s hould take caution before 
trading would also be provided on the SET’s website. Furthermore, cash collateral requirement for trading 
account was also increased to at least 20 percent 
from the previous requirement of 15 percent, effective from May 2, 2013 onwards.
  
Foreign exchange market 
 At the end of 2013 Q1, the Thai baht stood at 
29.29 baht per US dollar, appreciating by 4.31 
percent from the end of  the previous quarter (Chart 
3.5) owing to both domestic and external factors. 
External factors arose from improved global financial 
market sentiment after (1) the agreement was 
reached to avoid the US fisca l cliff, (2) economic data 
for the US and China improved, and (3) advanced 
economies continued with aggressive monetary 
policy easing. Meanwhile, domestic factors included 
(1) the catching up effect of the Thai baht with 
regional currencies after some investors had 
previously postponed investments in Thailand due to concerns over post-flood recovery, (2) improved 020406080100

more concrete government investment plans; and (4)

The above factors coupled with negative 
factors in many regional countries–for example, 
nuclear threat tension in the Korean Peninsula and 
impacts of the yen’s depreciation on South Korea’s economy, political uncertainti es in Malaysia, and the 
persistent current account  deficit in Indonesia–

Interest rates on normal term deposits of 
large commercial banks2/ in 2013 Q1 declined 
marginally from the end of 2012, partly due to adjustments of some deposit  rates to be consistent 
within deposit brackets. At the end of 2013 Q1, 
interest rates on the 12-month deposits of the four largest commercial banks averaged at 2.40 percent 
per annum. However, during this quarter, many 
commercial banks also introduced special deposit products such as the 7-, 13- and 47-month time 
deposits which gave higher interest rates than the  
12-month deposit rate in order to mobilize funds. 
Meanwhile, the average MLR of the four 
largest commercial banks remained unchanged from 
end-2012 at 7.00 percent per annum.  
Private credits at end-February 2013 
continued to grow strongly at 14.9 percent from the 
same period last year, decelerating slightly, however,  compared to the last quarter’s growth of 15.3 percent 
(Chart 3.7) . Consumer loans continued to expand 
notably, especially auto leas ings in tandem with the 
gradual delivery of cars u nder the government’s first-
car tax rebate scheme. Meanwhile, corporate loans 
also expanded well, for both investment and working capital in line with the investment upcycle.  
Deposits and bills of exchange (B/E) at end-
February 2013 continued to expand well, with an increase of 9.9 percent fr om the same period last 
year, although slowing somewhat from the previous 
quarter partly due to a continued contraction in B/E after the SEC announced a minimum B/E investment 
amount of 10 million baht, effective from July 1, 2012.

201354    Monetary Policy Report  April 2013  This together with a slight  slowdown in deposits 
results in a tightening of  overall liquidity conditions.  
Stability of financial institutions  
The overall stability of fi nancial institutions in 
2013 Q1 remained sound as reflected by the high 
capital adequacy ratio and low delinquency and NPL 
ratio. Meanwhile, commercial banks continued to record strong profitability.  
Commercial banks continued to pose strong 
profitability whereby net prof it for 2012 stood at 174.0 
billion baht, increasing from 146.5 billion baht 
recorded in 2011. Moreover, the ratio of capital 
adequacy in January 2013 stood at 16.0 percent, 
declining slightly from 16.3 percent in December 
2012 but remained significant ly above the 8.5 percent 
legal requirement. With regard to loan quality in the banking system, despite some tightening in liquidity 
conditions as reflected by  the loan to deposit and B/E 
ratio which stabilized at 93.1 percent (Table 3.1) , this 
was not yet a concern giv en that the delinquency and 
NPL ratio continued to stabiliz e at a low level of 5.3 
percent (Chart 3.8).   
Nevertheless, consumer  loans continued to 
expand notably, in particular auto leasings owing to 
the first-car tax rebate scheme and personal loans that moved in line with higher spending. Moreover, 
commercial banks also shift ed their focus to these 
types of lending given their high returns. These trends could potentially affect  loan quality in the next 
periods.

Stability in non-financial sectors was well 
maintained. The recovery in both domestic and 
foreign economies coupled with public spending 
helped improve performance of  the corporate sector. 
However, important risks that  warranted monitoring in 
the next periods included accelerating consumer loans and household debt, es pecially auto leasings 
as well as the high expansion in real estate activities 
which when coupled with rising construction costs 
and labor shortages, could affect construction and 
cause housing prices to increase going forward. 
Household sector 
Stability of the household sector remained 
sound thanks to high employment and household income. Nevertheless, households’ debt servicing 
ability needed to be monito red closely given that 
consumer loans, especially auto leasings continued 
to exhibit rather high growth. 
Households’ income and employment 
remained healthy. Empl oyment prospects were 
strong as reflected by the unemployment rate of only 
0.7 percent in January 2013 as well as increases in 
average earnings for both farm and non-farm employment (Chart 3.9) . Debt servicing ability of 
households remained satisfac tory as reflected by a 
low delinquency and NPL to consumer loans ratio of 4.7 percent.  
However, the persistent high growth of 
consumer loans led to some tightening in households’ liquidity conditi ons as reflected by an 
increase in the ratio of debt to financial assets of 
households from 45.9 percent in 2012 Q3 to 46.6 percent in 2012 Q4 (Chart 3.10) . Moreover,  
there were some signs of increasing stress in 100110120130140150160

increase in household debt which could potentially 
affect debt servicing ability will need to be monitored 
closely. 
Corporate sector 
Corporate profitability in 2012 Q4 declined. 
Nevertheless, gradual export recovery in tandem with global economic recove ry, continued domestic 
demand momentum, and fiscal spending were 
expected to help support improvements in corporate performance going forward. 
Corporate profitability in 2012 Q4 declined, 
partly due to the impact of the slowing global economy on exports. The aver age net profit of firms 
in the manufacturing sector declined from 465.6 
million baht in 2012 Q3 to 268.6 million baht in 2012 
Q4 (Chart 3.11) , subsequently caus ing the operating 
profit margin (OPM) to decli ne from 5.1 percent to 3.8 
percent. However, recovery in the domestic economy together with an increase in post-flood housing 
demand led to improvements in performance of 
related businesses from the previous quarter, particularly construction and real estate firms. 
Looking ahead, it was expected that the 
gradual recovery in exports in line with global economic recovery, as we ll as continued domestic 
demand momentum and public spending would help 
support improvement in corporate performance (Chart 3.12) . Nonetheless, important risks that could 
affect stability of the cor porate sector in the next 
periods included the impact  of rising operating costs 
as a result of the minimum wage policy and labor 
shortages as well as t he impact of the baht 
appreciation on corporate profit and liquidity, particularly for small and medium enterprises.

The real estate sector in 2013 Q1 continued 
to expand well from the previous year, in particular 
condominiums. Stability in t he real estate sector 
remained sound. However, important risks that 
warranted monitoring included the surge in provincial 
real estate activities, hi gher construction costs and 
labor shortages, which together could affect 
construction and cause housing prices to rise in the 
next periods. 
During the start of 2013, the overall real 
estate sector continued to improve from the previous 
year, in particular condominiums with an increase in demand as reflected by a rise in the number of 
housing registrations in B angkok and its vicinity in 
January 2013 compared to the previous month (Chart 3.13).  Furthermore, a survey of real estate 
businesses also revealed that most of the demand 
was real demand, that is, fo r actual residency. On the 
supply side, it was found that real estate firms 
continued to launch new openings, especially in 
areas close to sky train extensions (Chart 3.14) .  
Concerning risks to the real estate sector, it 
was assessed that al though housing prices 
increased, they were consistent with rising household income. This was reflected by the ratio of 
condominium price to income of home loan 
borrowers of 2.8, which re mained close to the five-
year average of 2.6. Moreover, commercial banks’ 
home loan standard and debt servicing ability of 
home loan borrowers remained intact. Nevertheless, signs of a more relaxed lending standard were 
starting to be observed as  reflected by the debt 
service coverage ratio (DSCR) in February 2013 of 4.4, which had been declin ing continuously since  
mid-2012 and was lower than its five-year average of 
4.6 (Chart 3.15) . 02468

Source: REIC2012 201358    Monetary Policy Report  April 2013  Although stability in the real estate sector 
remained sound overall, there were signs that people 
began to buy more than one house. This trend could 
pose risk to stability and would be monitored going forward  (Chart 3.16) . In addition, a survey of 
provincial real estate businesses revealed that 
activities in large provinces, especially openings of condominiums, were on the rise. There were signs of 
speculative activities in so me areas as reflected by a 
high level of reservations at new launches which led 
to rapid sold-outs as well as an increase in resale of 
reservation rights. Therefor e, the expansion in such 
activities, the quality and standard of home loans as 
well as the impact of risi ng production costs and labor 
shortages would be monito red closely, as these 
factors could affect profitab ility of real estate firms, 
particularly smaller firms, and could result in higher 
housing prices, going forward. 
Fiscal sector Stability of the fiscal sector was well 
maintained but the ratio of public debt to GDP could 
rise going forward, owing to the increase in public spending. 
Stability of the fiscal sector was well 
maintained as reflected by the ratio of public debt to 
GDP of 44.1 percent at end- January 2013, which was 
close to the previous quarter’s level (Chart 3.17) . 
Looking ahead, however, the ratio of public debt to GDP could rise on the back of increasing public 
spending, especially from the rice pledging scheme, 
the Royal Decree on Investment Loans for Water Resource Management and Future Development as 
well as the transport infrastr ucture development loan 
bill. Therefore, fiscal bur den could increase in the 
future. Chart 3.16  Volume of  approved mortgages
