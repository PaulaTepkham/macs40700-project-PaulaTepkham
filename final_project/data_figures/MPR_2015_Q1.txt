The Monetary Policy Report  is prepared quarterly by staff of the 
Bank of Thailand with the approval of the Monetary Policy Committee 
(MPC).  It serves two purposes: ( 1) to communicate to the public the  
MPC’s  consideration and rationales for the conduct of monetary policy, 
and (2)  to present the latest set of  economic and inflation forecast s, based 
on which  the monetary policy decisions  were made .

Monetary Policy in Thailand  
The Monetary Policy Committee  
Under the Bank of Thailand Act, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) comprise s the 
Governor and two deputy Governors, as well as four distinguished external members  
representing various sectors of the country, with the aim of ensuring  that monetary policy 
decisions are effective and transparent.  
The Monetary Policy Objective  
The MPC sets monetary policy to promote  the objective of supporting sustainable a nd full 
potential economic growth, without causing inflationary problems or economic and financial 
imbalances or bubbles.  
The Monetary Policy Target  
On January 6, 2015 t he Cabinet  approved the annual average headline inflation target of  
2.5 + 1.5 percent as the monetary policy target for 2015, in place of the quarterly average core 
inflation target of 0.5 – 3.0 percent . The new inflation target  was jointly proposed by the MPC 
and the Minist er of Finance. In the event that headline inflation deviates from the target,  
the MPC shall explain the reasons behind the target breach  to the public, together with 
measures taken and estimated time  to bring inflation back to the target.  
The Monetary Policy Instrument  
The MPC utilizes the 1 -day bilateral repurchase transaction rate as the policy interest rate to 
signal the monetary policy stance.  
Evaluati on of Economic Conditions and Forecasts  
The Bank of Thailand takes into account  information from all sources, the macroeconomic 
model, data from each economic sector, as well as surveys  of large enterprises , together with  
small and medium -sized  enterprises from all over the country,  and various financial institutions  
to ensure that economic evaluations and forecasts are accurate and cover all aspects, both at 
the macro and micro levels.   
Monetary Policy Communication  
Recognizing the importance of monetary policy communication to the public, the MPC 
employs  various  channel s of communication, both in Thai and English, such as (1) organizing 
a press statement at 14.00 on the day of the Committee meeting, (2) publishing edited 
minutes of the MPC meeting two weeks after the meeting, and (3) publishing the Monetary 
Policy Report  every quarter.  Monetary Policy Report  March 2015

1.1 Growth and inflation prospects  
The Committee revise d down Thailand’s  
economic growth forecast i n 2015 from 4.0  
to 3.8 percent,  in the light of the lower -than-
projected private spending in late 2014 . Weak 
private spending was caused by  waning  private 
sector  confidence , amidst concerns over 
uncertainties of future income . Businesses also  
delay ed their investment  as they  awaited  a clearer 
sign of economic recovery . Public spending is 
projected to edge up, but limitations remain in 
budget disbursements . Exports are assesse d to 
grow slightly below the  previous projection, with 
export  volumes  declin ing in line with slowing  The Thai economy expanded by slightly less than the previous projection 
due to weaker -than-anticipated domestic demand momentum in 2014 Q4, along 
with weakening global growth and less-than-expected public spending . Looking 
ahead, lower global oil prices will  likely support the recovery of private spending . 
Growth is projected to pick up pace in 2016, on a lower drag from household 
debt, greater clarity o n public spending, and an improvement in exports . 
Meanwhil e, headline inflation in 2015 is revised down significantly  on the back of 
lower oil prices , but is likely  to rebound in the second half of 2015 and in 2016 ,  
in line with oil price outlook.  
Against the backdrop of weaker -than-expected economic recovery and 
higher downside risks to growth, additional suppor t from monetary policy is 
necessary . Meanwhile, despite the forecast that headline inflation could breach 
the lower bound of th e target band, the M onetary Policy Committee  consider s this 
a result of falling energy prices, not a case of deflation caused by aggregate 
demand contraction.  2    Monetary Policy Report  March 2015   global growth . Export prices , especially commodity 
prices,  are also projected to fall due to feeble  
global demand and lower global oil prices . 
However,  the prospect of solid tourism growth  will 
provide a boost to the economy.  
The Thai economy in 2016 is projected 
to expand by 3.9 percent, due to a waning  drag 
from household debt and a clearer prospect of 
public expenditure reforms designed to  promote  
long-term investment . Exports  are likely to resume 
its role as a driver of growth , while a  rebound in 
domestic and external demand should help shore 
up private sector confidence  and boost private 
investment  going forward (Tables 1.1 and 1.4) . 
Headline inflation forecast in 2015 is 
adjusted down from 1.2 to 0.2 percent, below 
the lower bound of the  new inflation target band of  
2.5 + 1.5 percent . This adjustment follow s substantia l 
falls in global oil prices in recent periods . 
Never theless,  in the MPC’s view,  the latest  inflation  
forecast  does not signify  deflation  because  the 
prices  of most goods  continue d to rise or 
remain ed stable . Housing rents  also increased   
in early 2015, pushing up core inflation to 1.2 
percent . Public expectation  of medium -term inflation  
remain ed well anchored close to the central target 
of headline inflation . These reasons  were  specified  
earlier in an Open Letter issued to the public  
following the negative headline inflation in January 
2015 (Article: “Inflation Target in 2015”) . Moreover,  
headline inflation is likely to  remain low and 
negative in the first half of the year, before 
rebounding  in the latter half based on the 
Committee’s projection of oil price s. 
The h eadline inflation forecast for 2016 is  
2.2 percent, based on  the assumptions t hat oil and 
fresh food prices will  increase  from their 2015

1.2 percent . Although  inflationary pressure  from 
the demand side  is likely to  be l ower than 
previously  projected, it  is still fore casted to 
increase from last year . This is  reflected by the 
gradual  narrowing of the output gap in line with 
economic recovery (Chart 1.1) . 
The Commit tee factored the following 
observations  into the growth and inflation forecasts 
for 2015 and 2016.   
(1) Global economic recovery  is projected  
to be slower than previously forecast, due to a 
slowdown in the Chinese and Asian economies  
(Table 1.2).  
Sluggish  global  recovery, led by  a slowdown  
of the Chinese economy, prompted a downward 
revision  to the Committee’s forecast of merchandise  
export growth . Meanwhile, supply -side constraints 
in the Thai manufacturing  sector  are likely to weigh  
on merchandise exports, with Thai manufacturers 
still producing goods that do not respond to the 
changing global demand . Exports of services, 
however, are  projected to  post a strong  growth . In 
addition, d espite the economic slowdown in China, 
demand for foreign travels among  Chinese tourists  
is assessed to remain  strong . This should therefore  
help compensate for the adverse impacts caused 
by fewer  visitors from Russia, Europe and oil -
exporting countries.  
Moreover,  the prices of Thai agricultural 
products are likely to  be held down by moderating 
external  demand . As China is a major importer of 
commodities including agricultural commodities , 
weakening  Chinese growth will have a negative 
impact on these prices . Depressed agricultural 
prices will in turn  hit farm income s and undermin e 
household confidence . Private consumption is thus

assessed . 
(2) Domestic demand momentum in 
2014  Q4 was weaker than expected.  
 Private spending expanded at a lower rate 
than the previous assessment, reflecting fragile 
private sector confidence amidst concerns over 
weak economic recovery . Subdued farm income s 
and elevated household debt caused households 
to be cautious with their spending, especially on 
durable goods . Several industries  still had excess 
production capa city amidst  sluggish recovery of 
both domestic  and external demand, leaving little 
justificat ion for new private investment . This was 
consistent with the business sentiment survey , 
which suggested  most firms  chose to postpone 
their investment while await ing greater clarity on 
the economic recovery and public investment in 
infrastructure.  
 Moreover , financial institutions remained 
cautious  in lending to the private sector, especially 
households and small and medium enterprises 
(SMEs) . Although monetary policy continued to be  
accommodative, the strict lending by banks restrained  
household and busines s purchasing power, 
contributing to the slow recovery of domestic 
spending.  
 The Committee thus revise d down 
domestic  demand  momentum  in the forecast 
period , while expressing concern s over muted  
business confidence which, if prolonged , could 
further  discourage  productivity -enhancing investment  
and undermine Thailand’s long -term potential and 
competitiveness.  
 (3) Less -than-expected p ublic spending,  
particularl y public investment .  Monetary Policy Report  March  2015                                                          5  The Committee lowered  the forecast of the 
government’s budget disbursement  rate for fiscal 
year 2015  from 93 to 9 1.2 percent, largely due to 
sluggish  public investment . In the budget setting 
process, t he government planned to implement  
public spen ding reforms aimed at increas ing 
investment expenditure  to support  infrastructure 
development . However,  fiscal  stimulus measures 
have encountered short -term delay s due to (1) 
limitations in the budget disbursement  process ,  
especially  in investment expenditure  and (2) the 
introduction of lower construction costs  used for 
government procurement following lower oil prices . 
Disbursement  rate for the fiscal year 2016 are 
forecast ed at 9 0.5 percent  because (1)  an 
improvement in budget disbursement  might not be 
able to keep pace  with the simultaneous increase 
in public  investment  budgets  and (2) there is a 
continued shortage of labor in the construction 
sector  (Table 1.3). 
 (4) The decline in global oil prices 
during Q4 2014 and early 2015.  
 The Committee revise d down the baseline 
assumption for  global  oil price  to 60  U.S. dollars 
per barrel in 2015 and  70 U .S. dollars  per barrel in 
2016  (Chart 1.2) , on the back of substantial decline 
in oil prices in recent periods . Nevertheless , oil 
prices are projected to gradually increase in the 
latter half of 2015 . The Committee judge d that 
falling global oil prices will have the following  
impacts : (1) Lower d omestic retail oil prices  
caus ed headline inflation in 2015 to move 
significantly lower than previously forecast; (2) 
Private spending should pick up on the back of 
lower costs of living and production costs, thereby 
increasing purchasing power and will be reflected 
by growing private consumption in the periods 
ahead . (3) Low global oil prices w ill put downward

move  together with oil prices . Therefore, the prices 
of these commodities, particularly petroleum, 
chemicals  and rubber , will likely remain  low and 
slightly  below the previous projection . Given that 
these commodities  account for 18.4 percent of 
total Thai exports, the growth of merchandise 
exports is revised down from the previous 
assessment.  (4) As a net oil importer, Thailand  
benefits  from lower oil prices  through markedly 
lower oil import  values . This, in turn, should 
translate into a large current account surplus 
in 2015 (Table 1.4) , while contributing to the 
baht ’s strength  against regional currencies  in 
recent periods . Looking ahead, current account 
is expected to  move closer to  the equilibrium  in 
2016 . Imports are  projected to increase on the 
back of a rebound in domestic spending and 
assumption  of higher global oil prices  compared to 
the 2015 level (Table 1.5) .  
 Downside Risks  to Growth and Inflation 
Forecasts  
 According to t he MPC’s assessment, the 
probability that  growth will be below  baseline 
projection is higher than  the probability that it 
will be above the baseline projection . This 
assessment is  shown  in the  growth  fan chart , 
which is skewed downward  throughout the 
forecast  period  (Chart 1.3 and Table 1.6) .  
 Downside risks that could lead economic 
growth to be lower than the baseline projection  
stem from the following: (1) The pace of global 
economic recovery could  be slower than anticipated . 
Econo mic conditions in the euro area remain 
fragile,  plagued by the ongoing political uncertainty  
in Greece and the geopolit ical conflict concerning 
Russia . This factor,  coupled with the slowdown in

exports and continue to depress agricultural prices 
and farm income s. Meanwhile, p rivate sector 
confidence remains  weak  amidst sluggish  economic  
recovery . Therefore, p rivate spending could turn 
out to be lower than baseline projection.  (2) Public 
spending could fall short of expectation because 
disbursements  might not be able to keep pace 
with budget  expansion , especially with respect to  
public infrastructure investment projects.  
 Risk factors that could cause the economy 
to expand at a rate higher than the baseline 
projection  could arise from the following sources: 
(1) Public spending could exceed the previous  
forecast due to the second -round fiscal stimulus 
measures, including the water management system  
project  and the urgent road  transport  infrastructure 
development plan.  (2) Domestic retail oil prices 
could fal l below the baseline assumption and 
therefore provide further boost  to household 
spending.   
 In the light of the se risk factors, the 
Committee  judges that headline and core 
inflation are more likely to fall below the  
central projection than to surpass it . This is 
reflected  in the inflation fan charts that are 
skewed downward throughout the forecast 
period (Charts 1.4 and 1.5, Tables 1.7 and 1.8) . 
The assessment stems from the possibility that 
the government may cut the diesel and gasohol 
contribution rates to the Oil Fund,  in the light of  
the fund’s stronger balance . In addition , some 
Committee members  are of the view that  global oil 
prices could fall below the current  assumptions , 
while  domestic demand momentum may be more 
subdued  than the projection if  economic growth 
turns out to be weaker than expected .

 Monetary  policy has become more 
accommodative . 
 Monetary policy has  played  a greater role 
in supporting the Thai economy during  2015 Q1, 
amidst  weaker -than-expected economic recovery 
and higher downside risks to growth . While 
headline inflation is expected  to breach the lower 
bound of the target band, the Commit tee 
considers this a result of positive  supply -side 
shock s associated with lower energy prices . 
Therefore, t he lower inflation forecast  is not  deemed  
a sign of deflation stemming from aggregate 
demand contraction . 
At its meeting on January 28, 2015, the 
MPC voted 5 to 2 to maintain the policy interest 
rate at 2.00 percent, with t wo me mbers in favor of 
a reduction of  the policy rate by 0.25 percent . The 
Committee deliberated on the importance of public 
spending in driving the overall economic recovery . 
Moreover, t he Committee also discussed the 
implications that less accommodative monetary 
conditions and the possibility of inflation breach ing 
the target band would have on monetary policy 
conduct . The Committee agreed that clear and 
consistent public spendin g plans, especially 
investment projects, would  be highly effective in  
driving the growth  momentum . 
The majority of the Commit tee members 
deemed the level of  policy rate appropriate in 
maintaining  the consistency of monetary policy, 
given that economic conditions had remained 
largely unchanged  from the previous meeting . 
Despite the slow pace of growth, t he economy 
remained firmly on the path of steady recovery . Monetary Policy Report  March  2015                                                          9 Meanwhile, substantially lower oil prices would 
lend support to the rebound of domestic demand . 
Downside risks to the economy were generally 
well contained . Given this economic outlook , the 
2.00 percent policy rate did not hinder the ongoing 
economic recovery . Real interest rate, calculated  
based on  inflation forecasts, remained low . Besides,  
lower b orrowing costs in the bond markets should 
further b oost private sector financing . Although the 
easing of monetary policy by foreign central banks 
could encourage capital inflows to the Thai 
financial markets and put upward pressure on the 
baht, no significant inflows had been observed  to 
date. This was part ly due to the low yields  on the 
Thai government bonds relative to those in other 
regional countries . Moreover, the Committee viewed  
the possible breach of the headline inflation target  
to be caused by supply -side shocks from lower 
energy prices , which in turn should contribute to  
stronger economic recovery in the periods ahead . 
The lower inflation forecast  was not  an indication 
of deflation  arising from a contraction of aggregate 
demand , as confirmed by the fact that core 
inflation remained positive and quite stable .  
In addition,  public expectation of medium -term 
inflation  was well anchored  around the central  
target . This indicated that the public shared the 
MPC’s assessment  that the negative headline 
inflation  reading  was temporary  in nature . Under 
these circumstances  and with no deflation risks , 
additional easing of monetary policy was therefore 
considered unnecessary . 
Nevertheless, the minority of the Committee 
deemed it necessary to further ease  monetary 
policy . Their view s were  influenced by the 
substantially and persistently lower -than-potential 
growth performance of the Thai economy  and 
limitation of fiscal stimulus . Global recovery was 10    Monetary Policy Report  March 2015   also projected to  slow with greater downside risks . 
Moreover, a policy rate cut might  help cushion the 
impacts of easy monetary conditions abroad and 
reduce some of  the pressure on the baht . This 
could stem the  baht appreciation against the 
currencies of Thailand’s main trading partners and 
competitors . Given the recent move  to headline 
inflation targeting , reducing the policy rate should 
help bolster the credibility of monetary policy  
framework , at the time when headline inflation  
moved below  the lower bound of the ta rget band .  
Subsequently at the meeting on March 11, 
2015, the MPC voted 4 to 3 to lower the policy 
interest rate by 0.25 percent, fr om 2.00 percent to 
1.75 percent , with t hree members voting to keep  
the rate on hold . The Committee ’s deliberation  
focused on  the appropriate role  of accommodative 
monetary policy , given that the Thai economy was 
projected to recover at a slower pace than previously  
assessed . The Committee also considered the 
limitation of  fiscal stimulus, the subdued inflation 
forecasts in the periods ahead,  and the effectiveness  
and potential costs of additional easing of monetary  
policy  under  the current circumstances.  
The majority of the Committee members 
judged  that monetary policy should be further 
loosened to provide more support to economic 
growth and shore up private sector confidence, in 
the light of the  weakening momentum from private 
consumption and investment . The reduction in the 
policy rate would help ease monetary conditions . 
Meanwhile, risks to financial stability remained 
contained , as seen  by the recent  decline in price -
earnings ratio  (P/E ratio) following  new regulatory  
measures  and private sector’s  waning  debt 
accumulation  in line with soft economic conditions . Monetary Policy Report  March  2015                                                          11 Nonetheless, the minority of the Committee  
members were of the view that the current policy 
rate w as sufficiently accommodative for  bolstering 
econo mic recovery . In their views, the current 
policy rate was  low relative to that of regional 
countries , and did not hinder economic activit ies. 
Moreover, they believed that monetary policy 
space  should be preserved for future use,  should 
more needs arise and when policy transmission 
becomes more effective . Fiscal stimulus, especially  
the implementation of planned public investment, 
should be a key growth driver at this juncture . In 
addition, further easing of monetary policy might  
lead to more financial imbalances  such as  a 
higher  level of household debt, undermining long -
term financial stability.  
Going forward, t he Committee will closely 
monitor the progress of economic recovery  and 
stand  ready to take appropriate policy actions to 
support a steady recovery of the Thai economy , 
while ensuring long-term financial stability.

Percent2015 2016Monetary Policy Report  March 2015   15 Inflation target in 2015  
An appropriate inflation target is key to the central bank’s successful maintenance of 
price stability because it helps anchor public inflation  expectations . It is thus essential for the 
central bank to set an inflation target that is consistent  with the public understanding.  
To that end , on December 
17, 2014, the Monetary Policy 
Committee (MPC) proposed the 
annual average  headline inflation 
target of 2.5 + 1.5 percent1/ as the 
monetary policy target for 2015,  
in place of the quarterly avera ge 
core inflation target of 0.5  – 3.0 
percent . The new monetary policy 
target was approved by the 
Cabinet  on January 6, 2015 .  
The shift to headline inflation 
target should  lead to improved  
monetary policy communication  
with the public and greater effectiveness in  anchoring inflation expectations . Moreover,  
headline inflation is a better indicator  of changes in the price level and the cost of 
living than core inflation , as it covers all categories of goods and services consumed by the 
public, including energy and fresh food prices which  account for a sizable 27 percent of the 
consumer basket . Energy and fresh food prices have had a significant influence on inflation in 
recent periods, but excluded from core inflation  calculation . Research also shows that over 
the past ten years core inflation and headline inflation have  been  moving away from each 
other (Chart 1). 
Furthermore, a mid -point target of 2.5 percent  was introduced in place of an inflation 
target range of 0.5 – 3.0 percent . This change  will lead to clearer  signaling of  monetary policy to 
maintain price stability and improve the anchoring of inflation expectation . There is also a 
tolerance band of + 1.5 percent , allowing  flexibility for monetary policy  implementation  in order 
to meet the objectives of both output and price stability . At present , the tolerance band of 1.5 
                                         
1/  The MPC agrees to lower the mid -point target from 3.0 percent (MPC’s decision on September 17, 2014) to 
2.5 percent . This new target is considered a better reflection  of substantially lower global inflation outlook 
that stemmed from structural changes in the oil market . Technological advancement in shale oil production 
in the U.S., coupled with the expansion of oil production in non -OPEC countries, result in greater ab ility of 
oil supply to readily meet oil demand. At the same time, OPEC countries suffer from declining market 
power . As a result, it is less likely that crude oil prices will sharply increase, as was the case in the  
2000 -2011 period.

horizon is also extend ed, with annual  average inflation instead of the quarter  average , in order 
to be consistent with  the transmission lags of monetary policy . 
In practice , the approach , framework and the decision -making process of monetary  
policy remain  the same . The new inflation target  still retains  the essence  of the previous 
regime . That is, the mid -point of the new headline inflation target (2.5 percent) is simply  the 
sum of (1) the product of core inflation weight and the mid -point of the old inflation target 
range (0.73*1.75=1.28) and (2) the product of energy and fresh food prices weight and energy 
and food prices inflation (0.27*5.13=1.39) . The sum is about 2.67 ((3)+(4) in Table 1) . The 
policy deliberation process remains  unchanged , with the MPC still attach ing great importance  to 
supporting sustained economic growth in line with its potential, without undermining price 
stability . The MPC also seeks to anchor public inflation expectations to an appropriate level, 
taking a forward -looking approach in respond ing to demand -pull inflationary pressure s and 
inflation forecasts . In the process, headline inflation, core inflation, and other inflation indicators  
are al so taken into c onsideration . 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Nonetheless, the adoption of the new inflation target faces many  challenges because  
headline inflation is much more volatile  in nature than core inflation . Hence, headline 
inflation may sometimes  breach  the target as a result of changes in supply conditions  beyond the 
control of monetary policy, especially  changes in energy and fresh food prices . Monetary policy 
response may not be justified  in the short term , if inflation indicators do not suggest worrying 
demand -pull inflationary pressure s and if inflation forecasts remain appropriate . Nevertheless ,  
the MPC recognizes the importance of communicating  such development  to the public and 
the Ministry of Finance through an open letter . In essence, the MPC clearly explain ed the 
reasons for the breach of inflation target , as well as the steps  taken  and time needed to  
bring inflation back to the target . In line with the practice of other  central banks, the BOT’s 
communication with the public in this manner should  help anchor public inflation expectations.

Source: Ministry of Commerce, calculations by the Bank of ThailandMonetary Policy Report  March 2015   17 Since 2014 Q4, global oil prices have substantially droppe d. The resulting  fall in  
domes tic oil prices  is the chief reason behind the moderation of headline inflation, which 
turned negative and breached the lower bound  of the inflation target band in January 2015 . 
Although the annual  average inflation is not  breached, the MPC  wished to reaffirm its 
commitment to maintain ing the monetary policy framework  and anchoring public inflation 
expectations . Hence , to foster public understanding of the inflation situation,  the MPC  
submitted an open letter to the Ministry of Finance on February 2, 2015 , and publishe d 
the letter on the BOT website .2/ The key messages of the letter were as follows.  First,  
headline inflation  in January 2015 was below the lower bound of the target band because of 
lower global oil prices. Headline inflation is expected to remain  negative until 2015 Q2, after 
which it was forecast to pick up and move within the band of the target  by 2015 Q4 . Second,  
the negative headline inflation was not an indication of deflation . Lower oil prices were also 
expected to  lend support to economic recovery . Third, the MPC considered the decline in 
headline inflation a result of supply factors rather than sluggish deman d. The present 
monetary policy stance was deemed adequately supportive of economic recovery and should  
help bring headline inflation back to within the target band by the end of this yea r.

2.1 The global economy  
The global  economy  expanded  at a slower  
pace  than assessed  in the last monetary  policy   
report  due to slower  growth  in the Chinese  and 
Asian  economies . Meanwhile , the U.S. economy  
continued  to post solid growth , while  the euro area 
and the Japan ese economies  showed  improvement  
from the previous  quarter .  
The U.S. economy  exhibited  robust  growth  
stemming  from continu ed improvement  in economic  
fundamentals .  
The U.S. Economy  in 2014  Q4 grew  by 
2.2 percent  (qoq saar, second  estima te). The pace  
of recovery  moderated  from the previous  quarter  
due to a decline  in  defense  spending  from three  
months  earlier . Nonetheless , private  consumption  
and investment  showed  signs  of a steady  recovery  
(Chart  2.1).    The global  economy  recovered  at a lower  pace  than previously  
assessed , owing  to a slowdown  in the Chinese  and other  Asian  economies . The 
U.S. grew  at a solid pace , while  the euro area and the Japan ese economies  
showed  improvement  from the previous  quarter . Going  forward , the plunge   
in global  oil price s is expected  to support  global  economic  recovery .  
  In 2014  Q4, the Thai economy  recovered  at a gradual  pace , held down  
by weak  domest ic spending  associated  with concern s over future  income . 
Private  investment  also stalled  amidst  uncertainties  over economic  recovery  and 
public  investment , which  was delayed  by limitations  in policy  implementation . By 
contrast,  exports  of goods  and services  expanded  more  than expected , leading  
to an improvement  in the manufacturing  sector , while  government  spending  
edged  up.

GDP20       Monetary Policy Report  March 2015   In 2015  Q1, the U.S. economy  is expected  
to continue  expanding , given  gradual ly improv ing 
economic  fundamentals . Although  a number  of 
key economic  indicators  in January  2015 , including  
Retail  Sales , Manufacturing  and Service  PMI, 
suggested  a decline  in economic  activity , they 
partly  reflect  corrections  from steep  accelerations  
of the previous  period .  
The U.S. monetary  policy  remained  
accommodative  as the economy  continued  to 
expand,  reflected  by a faster -than-expected  
decline  in unemployment  rate. However,  a number  
of labor  market  indicators  indicated  conflicting  
signals  about  the strength  of the labor  market  
recovery . For example,  wages  have  not yet 
displayed  significant  improvement . Moreover,  
inflation  reading  was well below  target  as a result  
of the fall in global  oil price s. The FOMC  at its 
January  27 – 28, 2015  meeting  maintained  the 
Federal  Funds  Target  rate at 0 – 0.25 percent.   
The euro area economy1/ recovered  
gradually,  supported  by lower  oil prices  and 
weakening  euro. Business  confidence  also edged  
up, likely  indicating  continued  growth  in private  
consumption . Further  risks remain,  however,  from 
the ongoing  disagreements  regarding  the assistance  
plan for Greece.   
The euro  area economy  in 2014  Q4 grew  
by 0.3 percent  (qoq sa), up from 0.2 percent  
                                                        
1/ The euro area economy  consists of 18 countries that 
share the euro as an official currency. As of 2013, 
Germany, France, Italy, and Spain contributed to 28, 21, 
17, and 11 percent of the economy respectively, while 
Greece, Ireland, and Portuguese together acco unted for 
6 percent. Lithuania joined the group at the beginning of 
2015, contributing to 0.4 percent of the 19 -country 
currency union.   Monetary Policy Report  March 2015                             21 recorded  in the previous  quarter . Improvements   
in Germany  and Spain  from gains  in private  
consumpt ion and exports,  which  resulted  from low 
oil price s and weaker  euro. The Italian  economy  
stalled  from the previous  quarter,  while  France’s  
growth  moderated  due to weakening  domestic  
consumption.   
The euro area economy  will likely  pick up 
in 2015  Q1 in line with various  confidence  indices,  
such  as Consumer  Confidence  Index,  European  
Commission  Sentiment  Index,  and Purchasing  
Managers’  index,  which  edged  up during  the first 
two months  of 2015  (Chart  2.2). Nonetheless,  
further  risks stem  from a probable  Greek  default,  
should  Greece  and its creditors  fail to strike  a deal 
for the ongoing  debt wrangle , as well as potential  
escalation  of the Russia -Ukraine  conflict . Despite  
the uncertainties , bank  credit  began to show  signs 
of improvement,  as reflected  in better  credit  growth  
in 2015  Q1 according  to the Bank  Lending  Survey.  
Such  condition  should  help enhance  the ECB’s  
policy  transmission  to the real economy2/.  
Driven  by private  consumption  and export s, 
the Japanese  economy  recovered  from a technical  
recession  in 2014  Q4.  
The Japanese  Economy  in 2014  Q4 
expanded  by 0.6 percent  (qoq sa) (Chart  2.3), 
after the previous  two quarters  of contraction.  
Private  consumption  improved  gradually,  while  
                                                        
2/ On January 22, 2015, the Governing Council of the 
European Central Bank agreed to (1) keep all types of 
interest rates unchanged, (2) expand its asset purchase 
program to 60 billion euro per month from March 2015 to 
September 2016, or until the medium -term inflation 
target of 2 percent is achieved, and (3) cut the interest 
rate for the TLTROs by 0.1 percent for the r emaining six 
operations.

its trading partners . Private  investment  and fiscal  
spending,  on the other  hand,  stalled  in the last 
three  months  of 2014 .  
Further  recovery  will likely  continue  in 
2015  Q1. Private  consumption  is expected  to pick 
up after a strong  possibility  of wage  rise following  
wage  negotiation  round,  scheduled  around  mid-year. 
Also,  manufacturing  sector  will likely  improve  in 
line with the rise in domestic  demand  and exports,  
with the latter  boosted  by stronger  demand s from 
major  trading  partners,  particularly  the U.S. and 
the UK 
At the MPC  Meeting  on February  18, 
2015,  the Bank  of Japan  pledged  to maintain  the 
Quantitative  and Qualitative  Monetary  Easing  
(QQE)  measure  in order  to achieve  the 2 percent  
core inflation  target . The Monetary  Policy  Committee  
also judged  that the economy  is on a gradual  
recovery  path, and inflation  will likely  moderate  
following  the decline  in energy  price s, although  
longer-term inflation  expectation s continue d to 
trend  up.  
The Chinese  and Asian  economies  
(excluding  Japan)  expanded  at a slower  pace  than 
expected,  with the Chinese  growth  slowdown  
adversely  affecting  exports  of Asian  trading  
partners . Nevertheless,  the fall in global  oil price s 
helped  support  consumption  in most  economies.   
The Chinese  econom y in 2014  Q4 grew  at 
the same  rate with the previous  quarter,  leading  to 
7.4 percent  annual  growth,  down  from 7.7 percent  
last year. The slowdown  was due partly  to 
moderat ing investment  spending . Investment  was 
held down  by various  fiscal  and financial  reform  
measures,  including  stricter  control s over new 
investment  projects  in industri es with high excess  Monetary Policy Report  March 2015                             23 capacity  and the tighter  supervision  of new loan 
issuance  to risky borrowers,  particularly  in the 
shadow  banking  sector . As part of the current  
reform , the Chinese  government  has implemented  
various  measures  to mitigate  the slowdown   
in growth,  including  lowering  the policy  interest  
rates and bringing  forward  investment  plans  in 
infrastructure.  
In 2015  Q1, the Chinese  growth  will likely  
remain  subdued  as investment  slows  in real estate  
due to excess  supply,  and in manufacturing  due to 
falling  profit  margin s. Moreover,  local gover nment  
investment  faces  limitations  from declining  land-
related  revenue  following  lower  land prices. 
However , private  consumption  is projected  to 
expand  at a rate close to the previous  quarter,  as 
labor  market  conditions  remain  solid. Exports  
should  also pick up in line with stronger  signs  of 
the U.S. recovery.   
Given  various  indicators  pointing  to weak  
economic  activities  and tight liquidity  conditions,  
the People’s  Bank  of China  (PBOC)  on February  
4, 2015,  announced  a reduction  in the Reserve  
Requirement  Ratio  (RRR)  for all types  of financial  
institutions  from 20 to 19.5 percent . Then , on 
February  28, 2015,  the PBOC  eased  its monetary  
policy  further  by cutting  both the lending  rates and 
the deposit  rates  by 0.25 percent,  after a similar  
decision  last quarter.  
In 2014  Q4, the Asian  economies  
(excluding  China  and Japan)  expanded  at a 
slower  pace  than in the previous  quarter  (Chart  
2.4), after exports  softened  due to a fall in Chinese  
and regional  demands.  However,  consumption  
growth  was robust,  thanks  to the decline in oil 
prices  that boosted  households’  disposable  
incomes.   Overall  inflation  moderated,  largely  from

inflation  in the target  range,  central  banks  in the 
region  kept their policy  interest  rates  unchanged,  
deeming  them  sufficiently  supportive  to continued  
economic  growth.  
Recent  economic  indicators  in 2015  Q1 
suggest ed moderating  growth  in the Asian  
economies,  compared  to the previous  quarter .  
A number  of economies  began  to witness  slowing  
exports  from falling Chinese  demand . Weak  
exports,  in turn, have  led to a stall in investment . 
Meanwhile,  domestic  demand s remain ed subdued , 
despite  lower energy  prices.  
The sharp  fall in global  oil price s should  be 
a driver  behind  global  economic  recover y by 
boosting  purchasing  power s, and consumption . 
However,  such effect s may take time to materiali ze 
or become  diluted  by various  factors : (1) 
investment s by net exporters  of petroleum  
products,  such  as Malays ia and Indonesia,  are 
declining ; and (2) domestic  oil price s in some  
countries,  such  as Indonesia,  do not fall to the 
same  extent  with the drop in global  oil price s, 
because  the government s have  taken this 
opportunity  to reduce  energy  subsidies.   
2.2 The domestic economy  
The Thai  economy continued to recover, 
albeit at a slower pace than previously assessed . 
Major drivers of growth in 2014 Q4 were the rise in 
the number of Asian tourists, who became less  
concerned  about the political situation in Thailand, 
and large r-than-expected  export growth  from 
stronger  demand from the U.S. and the CLMV 
region  (Chart  2.5).

In 2014 Q4, exports of services, most 
importantly tourism, resumed their role as a key 
driver of growth, with a momentum carried over 
into 2015 Q1. Asian tourists, particularly Chinese 
and Malaysian, contributed to the growth  due to 
regained confidence over  political situation and 
various tourism stimulus measures  at the 
beginning of 2014 Q43/ (Chart  2.7). The increase 
in number of Asian tourists offset  the fall from 
other major markets, including Europe (including 
Russia) and Japan, whose economies experienced  
sluggish growth , currency depreciations, as well 
as official warnings against travel to Thailand .  
In 2014 Q4, export quantity expanded due 
to recovery in the U.S. orders  and robust  CLMV 
demand (Chart  2.8), leading to gains in exports  
of many industries, including machiner y and 
equipmen t, petrochemical, electronics, automotive , 
and agricultur e, particularly rice and sugar . Also, 
European importers expanded  their orders before 
the end of GSP in 2015. Imports, on the other 
hand, contracted substantially on the sharp decline  
in commodity prices, particularly  oil. Looking 
ahead, in 2015 Q1 exports are likely  to recover  at 
a grad ual pace, given the slowdown in the 
Chinese and ASEAN economies . Moreover, Thai

technological capabilities required to adapt to the 
changing global demand s. Such limitation was 
evident in the export s of Hard Disk Drive, which is 
growing at a slower pace compared with those of 
regional competitors . Further headwinds include  
falling commodity pri ces, most importantly oil 
price s, which will hurt  some  export value s going 
forward.  See Box “Impact s of China’s economic  
slowdown on the Thai economy.”  
In 2014 Q4, fiscal spending increased 
from the previous quarter (Chart  2.9), although the 
efficacy of government investment  implementation  
remained limited . Nonetheless, fiscal consumption 
expenditures saw a slight increase thanks to  
various me asures to speed up budget disbursement s. 
Due to earlier fiscal spending, public expenditures  
in 2015 Q1  are projected to moderate . Another 
drag on fiscal spending will stem from the delay  in 
the government procurement process, as the 
auction floor prices were  revised down following 
the drop in oil price s. (See Box  “Challenges in 
public investment budget disbursement.”    
In 2014 Q4, private investment expanded 
at a slower rate, and is projected to continue  its 
pace in 2015 Q1 . The projected subdued growth is 
a result of (1) weak farm income s following 
declining agricultural prices, (2) elevated level of 
household debt, (3) cautious lending behavio r of 
financial institutions, and (4) concern s over future 
income, reflected by weakening consumer confidence  
(Chart  2.10) . The four factors together rendered 
consumers more careful about spending (Chart  
2.11) .   
Private investment grew at a slow pace in 
2014 Q4, a trend which is likely  contin ue in 2015

Import s in 2014 Q4 remained at a low 
level, and are un likely  to pick up in 2015 Q1, in 
line with sluggish private consumption and 
investment, as well as slow recovery in export s. 
Import contraction was a result of the sharp 
decline in commodity prices, especially oil . 
Supply conditions  
Industrial production posted a mild growth 
in 2014 Q4, after six consecutive quarters of 
contraction (Chart  2.13) . Greater  demand s from 
the U .S. and CLMV, as well as acceleration of 
export s to the euro area before the expiration  of 
GSP, were largely responsible  for the expansion . 
This was also reflected by  the increase in electricity  
utilization, the larger number of workers in industrial  
sector, and a rise in import s of raw materials 
(excluding fuel s and chemical products) . In 2015 
Q1, industrial production is projected to recover 
only gradually, as a result of slowing  demand for 
exports from China, ASEAN, and the euro area .  
In addition, domestic demand growth is likely to 
remain  weak , given lower -than-average domestic 
spending .  
The service sector  expanded from a rise in 
the number of tour ists, which grew by 12.8 percent 
in 2014 Q4 . The improvement is likely  to continue 
in 2015 Q1, as tourists, especially Chinese and 
Malaysian, become less concerned about  the 
political situation . Tourism industry, especially 
hospitality , will  continue to  benefit from the 
development  (Chart 2.14) .

Agricultural production contracte d in 2014 Q4, 
especially after the decline in rubber price had 
disincentivized rubber tapping . In 2015 Q1, 
however, agricultural productio n is expected to

scheme for rubber, which will encourage more  
rubber tapping, as well as favorable weather 
conditions . In addition , production of shrimps, 
which has  suffered from an epidemic over the past 
two years, is likely to recover in 2015 .  However, 
the improvement in rubber and shrimp production 
will be insufficient to compensate for the subdued 
agricult ural prices, especially for  rubber, leading to 
a fall in  overall farm income s (Chart  2.15). 
Employment in 2014 Q4 were largely stable . 
Non-agricultural employment rose as a result of 
export s recovery , as well as  labor migration from 
agricultural to non -agricultural sectors,  following  
the weak  agricultural prices .  Moreover, the growth 
of non-agricultural wages indicated expanding 
demand for labor in the se sector s. However, in 
2015 Q1, unemployment rate is expected to rise 
slightly  due to the fall in farm employment, 
although some of these workers will enter into 
industrial and construction  employment.

Source : Bureau of Trade and Economic Indices, Ministry of Commerce , 
calculations by Bank of ThailandPercent30       Monetary Policy Report  March 2015   Since 2014 Q4, global commodity prices, 
particularly crude  oil price s, have declined  
massive ly, leading to falling domestic energy 
prices . As a result, headline inflation fell to a 
negative 0.47 percent in the first two months this 
year, in line with global inflation trend (Chart  
2.17) . Core inflation, on the other hand, remained 
stable, averaging at 1.54 percent for the same 
two-month period (Table 2.1 and Chart  2.18) .  
The fall in oil price s affect ed domestic 
prices of goods and services via two main 
channels . (1) Direct impact on d omestic energy 
prices, which fell by 21.75 percent on average 
over the first two months of 2015.4/ (2) Indirect 
impact on production and transportation  costs, 
including lower electricity bills, reduced fares for 
first and second -class  air-conditioned public 
buses, as well as boat s (Chart  2.19) . Despite the 
fall in production cost s, prices of  most  goods and 
services have not been marked down noticeably , 
since  firms normally cut prices when  the reduction  
in costs is deemed sustained and substantial . 
Also, since transportation cost s only account for 
about 2.29 percent  of GDP, the impact of lower 
production cost s has been marginal5/. 
The decline in headline inflation can be 
largely attributed to the substantial fall in oil price s, 
rather than to sluggish demand . In addition, negative  
inflation reading does not give rise to deflation 
concerns , because (1) prices of most goods and 
servic es, except energy -related,  remain close to 
long-term historical  averages, and (2) one-year

Economics and Bank of Thailand’s Business 
Sentiment Survey, are  2.10 and 2.58 percent 
respectively (Chart  2.20) . This points to the public’s  
assessment  that negative headline inflation was 
transitory  in nature .  
Given subdue d global commodity prices, 
especially crude oil price s, inflation ary pressure s 
are likely to remain low for the next two quarters . 
Although global oil price s rebounded moderately 
in February 2015, excess oil suppl ies, coupled 
with weak global demand s, should keep the price s 
at low level s for an extended period . Meanwhile, 
slower -than-forecast recovery of the Thai economy  
will exert additional downward pressure on short -
term inflation, consistent with  Underlying Inflation,6/ 
which ind icate d low inflation ary pressure s in the 
first half of 2015  (Chart  2.21) .  
Looking ahead, headline inflation is expected  
to remain negative for some time, given low 
energy price s. Our assumptions of a recovery in 
oil price s, from lower  suppl ies, and a gradual 
global economic recovery led to our projections  
of positive headline  inflation in the second half of 
this year .

Percent (change compared to the same period last year)32 Monetary Policy Report  March  2015 Impact s of China’s economic slowdown on  the Thai economy  
Since  2010, China’s economic 
growth  has been decelerating following  
the period of high economic growth. 
While it is natural  for an economy to 
experience slower growth as it grow s 
larger , the current slowdown of the 
Chinese economy could also be attributed  
to the Chinese government’s economic 
reform . The reform puts  a stronger  
emphasis  on stability than  growth, and 
aims at relying on  domestic consumption,  
rather than export s and investment, as 
the main propeller for growth.  Such reform policies have led to a slowdown in domestic 
demand in the short run and a slowdown in import demand , in particular for commodities  
(Chart  1). 
Despite moderating domestic 
demand , China’s exports  are projected 
to continue expand ing, as the recovery 
in advanced  economies  led to growing 
demand for inte rmediate goods , which in 
turn constitutes as much as 27 percent 
of total import s value. However, the 
growth rate of China’s import s of 
such goods may not be as high as it 
was in the past due to certain 
structural limitations . China now places  
a stronger emphasis on  horizontal 
integration,  i.e. increasing domestic production of goods within its  production chain as 
substitutes for imports of specialized goods from various  other countries, particular ly from 
ASEAN  (Chart 2) . There is also increased vertical integrati on, i.e. trading of intermediate  
goods . This is a result of China’s economic reform  policy which aims to upgrade the country’s  
production chain to a more technologically  advanced and  sophisticated level, and the 
relocation of production base to other countries in response to the sharp increase s in 
production cost s in the Chinese market.  
China is the most important market for the Thai economy, both in terms of exports and 
tourism . The Chinese market  constitut es 11 percent  of Thailand’s total exports, while Chinese 
tourists account for  19 per cent of  total visitors  to Thailand in 2014 . The effects of China’s

tourism should  be marginal.  
Impact s on the merchandise export s 
The slowdown of the Chinese 
economy  is likely to affect the Thai 
export sector more significantly than it 
did in the past . This is because it is an 
outcome of a structural change in the  
Chinese  economy, which in turn caused a 
moderation of domestic demand during the 
reform period, as well as a decrease in the 
demand for goods used for domestic 
consumption (f inal demand)1/. The effect of 
the slowdown on the Thai economy will be 
more pronounced than in the past because 
Thai export s of final de mand goo ds constitutes  
more than 50 per cent of total Thai exp orts 
to China in 2014.  This contrasts with the 
situatio n in the past where a major  share of 
Thai export s to China  constituted goods 
which we re re -processed for export s2/ 
(Chart 3) . The shift in the export composition  
is due to  the following factors: (1) The 
Chinese g overnment ’s policy to stimulate 
the economy after the global financial 
crisis, making China the world’s largest  
consumer of several commodities, ( ) China’s  
econ omic reform  which places a strong 
empha sis on developing the manufacturing  
sector, making China less reliant on import ed 
interme diate  goods, and (3) The global shift 
in consumer preference away from desktop 
computers and notebooks towards tablets 
and smartphones, resulting in a significant

category.   
Therefore, the economic slowdown in China  is likely to weigh on Thailand’s export s 
volume of final demand goods , especially commodities such as rubber and rubber products, 
tapioca and petroleum  (Chart 4) . Moreover, as China is one of the world’s major consumer 
market, its subdued domestic demand  would also exert pressure on the global commodity 
price s, which in turn depress Thailand’s farm income s even in the absence of direct export 
linkage . However, the export s of intermediate  goods should  continue to grow in line with  
China’s projected export growth.  
On top of the expected slowdown of Thai export s to China, the export sector 
may also experience an indirect effect through the slowdown of Thai export s to 
ASEAN . Thai export s to ASE AN makes up as much as 26.1 per cent of total export s in 2014.  
Many ASEAN countries export a considerable amount of consumer goods to China.  
Therefore, the demand for Thai imports in ASEAN markets may also subside  following 
ASEAN cou ntries’ reduced export s revenue.  Among Thailand’s exports to ASEAN , the items 
which  are likely to feel the impact  include autom obiles , electronics, petroleum and petrochemicals .  
Impacts  on the tourism sector  
The impact  of China’s economic  slowdown on the tourism industry is likely to 
be limited , due to the following factors: 1) Demand for  foreign travels among  Chinese 
tourists should  continue to rise in tandem with  increasing per capita income . Moreover, the 
share of outbound Chinese tourists to its 
total p opulation is also likely to increase , 
although it is still relatively low compared 
to the developed countries , reflecting 
ample untapped potential in the tourism 
sector;  2) Thailand is among  the top 
destinations for Chinese tourists  as it 
offers  value  for money . Also, Thailand can 
be easily reached , now that s everal airlines 
have started  operating  new routes, facilitating  
the transportation of tourists from various 
Chinese provinces to Thailand. Thailand’s 
share as a destination for outbound Chinese  tourists is therefore constantly on the rise.  
However, the political unrest in Thailand in 2014  caused a drop in Thailand’s  share from the 
previous year  (Chart 5) . Thus , given that the political situation in Thailand remains stable  in 
2015 , the share should gradually pick up ; 3) The protest against the Chin ese g overnment 
and Chinese tourists in Hong Kong  should  benefit Thai tourism , as some Chinese 
tourists are likely to shift  their destination fr om Hong Kong to other countries  (Hong 
Kong has the highest share of Chinese tourists  at 40 per cent) . This can be reflect ed from the Monetary Policy Report  March  2015  35 February 2015 statistics during which there was  a long public hol iday in China. At the time, 
Thailand received  an increasing number of Chinese tourists, while the number of Chinese 
tourists to Hong Kong contracted for the first time in 20 years.  
From the above factors, the number of Chinese tourists coming to Thailand is 
projected to grow solidly despite the expected economic slowdown.  The amount of 
spending per day by Chinese tourists is also unlikely to be affected , as the slowdown in 
the recent period  had in fact corres ponded with higher daily spending of Chinese tourists , 
while  their stay continued to lengthen  
(Chart 6) . In the long run,  however, the 
policy  should focus on  the revenues 
received from touris m rather than the 
number of tourists.  Historically, p rice has 
been  a key selling point of Thai tourism . In 
the longer run, however, t his could 
become  an obstacle for the industry to 
upgrade itself to a higher quality and 
value -added level, and therefore hold back 
its revenue potential  in the periods ahead . 
In summary , China’s economic slowdown that resulted from  its reforms is likely to 
weigh on  Thai export s, especially merchandise  export s for domestic consumption in China.   
It may also indirectly affect Thai export s through  moderating export s to ASEAN . Export s of 
intermediate  goods used for re -processing for export s, while the tourism sector , should  be 
relatively unaffected.  The slowdown of the Chinese  economy  and ASEAN is one of the 
reasons for the BOT’s downward revision of export  value  growth in 2015 to 0.8 percent, 
compared to 1.0 percent in the December  2014 report .

Source: Survey by Department of Tourism36 Monetary Policy Report  March 2015  Challenges in public investment budget disbursem ent 
For several years, the government has recognized the importance of public investment  
in lifting the country’s economic potential . Larger  funds have  therefore been allocated for 
public investment, both in the annual budget and fiscal stimulus packages  in some years . 
Despite the government ’s attempts  in expedit ing budget disbursement s, aggregate fiscal 
injection into the economy  has not increased as much as hoped . This raises an important 
question  as to what exactly impedes budget disbur sement , and will the y be resolved in the 
future?  
1. Public investment  is affected by two primary factors.   
(1) Structural problems stemming  
from limitations of  the efficienc y of 
public agencies  
In the past five years, the 
government allocated increasingly larger  
funds for public investment . Public 
agencies therefore had to execute 
greater  number of investment projects 
simultaneously . However, inefficiencies 
in the operations of government agencies 
resulted in  a gradual downward trend  
in public investment  disbursement , while  
the increase in public spending on 
investment has turned out to undersho ot expectation s (Chart 1 ). 
Analysis of the trend in public investment budget disbursement  reveals important facts . 
The delayed passage of the budget bill for fiscal year 2012 caused  most public agencies to 
postpone their investment plans , with the allocated funds  accumulated for  subsequent year s. 
Public agencies also  have had to implement projects that drew on extra -budgetary  funds .  
For example, the remaining funds from  “Thai Khem Khaeng” fiscal stimulus were used to finance 
the housing repair project s in fiscal year 2015 . With constraints on their operations, p ublic 
agencies struggled to cope with the sheer increase in the number of government investment 
projects . The restrictions stem med from the  low capacity caused by inadequate  number of  staff 
and a shortage of capable contractors  to undertake projects in provincial areas . Furthermore,  the 
government’s auction floor  prices for construction projects were sometimes  lower than the current 
market rate, discouraging firms from participating in project auctions . This caused delays in the 
procurement for some public agencies . Nevertheless,  since early 2015  the government has 
attem pted to expedite  budget  disbursement by urging  public agencies to  enter into contracts of 
investment projects . At the end of February 2015, government agencies signed contracts for 
investment projects accounting for a sizable 30 percent of the total public investment expenditure

Total disbursement rate (RHS)Fiscal yearMonetary Policy Report  March 2015   37 – a fairly high figure compared to  those of  the previous years . Nevertheless, due to public 
agencies’ efficiency constraints , the rate of disbursement s for public investment over the first five 
months of fiscal year 2015 remained modest .  
(2) Temporary factors: political situation and lower auction floor prices of government  
construction  projects  
 (2.1) Political situation . Political uncertaint y contributed to much of the delay in 
budget disbursement s for public investment . Since the easing of the political situation  in 2014 Q3 , 
the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO)  has urged government agencies to  expedite 
budget disbursement  for public investment and enter  into contracts on investment projects . 
However, these measures have not yielded  satisfactory outcome because of the failure to resolve 
the structural constraints discussed above . In addition, if government agencies fail to enter into 
contracts  before the deadline,  they can request their  investment project s to be undertaken at a 
later time, further causing the delays in budget disbursement .  
 (2.2) Measure to reduce the auction floor prices of government  construction  
projects was introduced by the Cabinet on December 30, 2014, on the back of sharply lower 
diesel prices . The measure affected government agencies that had been in the process of 
procurement or implementation of investment projects (before December 16, 2014) but had not 
signed the  contracts . These agencies would have  to lower the construction costs according to the 
new auction floor  rates . This measure is expected to cause  some  investment projects to be 
delayed by two months, but will not have a substantial impact on budget disbursement s.  
2. State enterprise investment, which  accounts for almost half of public investment, has 
also faced delays in disbursement in recent periods due to two main factors .  
(1)  Uncertaint y in government policy  and the country’s long -term investment plan  
Several state enterprise investment projects experienced delays as a result of uncertaint y 
in government policy and long -term investment plan . Investment projects and long -term financing 
plans were altered by each different government . For example, the high -speed train project or the 
2-trillion -baht infrastructure development bill was ruled  unconstitutional . This prompted the 
government to revert  to the normal budget allocation procedure  where loans extended to state 
enterprises are reviewed on a case -by-case basis.  
(2)  Policy to address structural problems of state enterprises  
 (2.1)  Anti-corruption measure s. The NCPO established the Committee on the 
Inspection of Public Expenditures to ensure transparency in contracts and procurement 
concerning large -scale public investment projects . As a result, several projects are being reviewed 
and some were canceled.  
 (2.2)  State enterprise reform . The NCPO set up the  State Enterprise Policy and 
Supervisory  Committee  tasked with formulating policy and supervisory standards for state 
enterprises . The goal was to increase efficiency in state enterprise op erations and quality of 38 Monetary Policy Report  March 2015  service . Construction Sector Transparency Initiative and Integrity Pact standards were used to 
enhance transparency in every step of government procurement . On February 24, 2015, t he 
Committee also devised and approved restructuring plans for state enterprises with heavy losses, 
prompting these state enterprises to review their previous investment plans.  
The anti -corruption and state enterprise reform measures may have delayed the 
disbursement s for public investment in the short term , but over the long term should  help enhance 
the transparency of the procurement process and reduce the accumulated losses of state 
enterprises . The measures are also expected to lead to greater efficiency in the state agencies 
and better return s to public investment.  
Beside the above two factors, state enterprises also face varying  structural problems . 
For example, the PTT group needs to cope with lower global oil prices and delays in the latest 
round of  petroleum concessions, which are awaiting legal amendments . The Electricity 
Generating  Authority of Thailand (EGAT) suffers from a shortage of technicians, and a lengthy 
process of investment project approval s caused by the need to evaluate the diverse impacts of 
the projects . It takes considerable time to address these structural problems.  
In conclusion, the government has made an attempt to expedite  public investment and 
address  short -term limitation s to budget disbursement s. Such measures include the monthly 
monitoring of disbursement s of individual state agencies, and the Budget Bureau’s lifting  of 
auction floor construction prices for some agencies . The government also aims to overcome  
long-term impediments  to budget disbursement s. To reduce uncertaint y in government policy, 
clearer and consistent long -term investm ent planning  are devised through the implementation of 
priority investment projects and state enterprise reform . However, these efforts may take time to 
materialize, especially with regard to  the limited efficiency of the state agencies . If the government 
is able to prioritize investment projects, allocate sufficient number of staff  in line with increasing 
investment projects, and cut back on new regulations or measures that may hamper budget 
disbursement s for investment project s, then t hese ongoing efforts will be able to enhance  the 
government’s role in driving the economy , as well as boost ing private sector  confidence and 
private investment . Going forward, higher overall investment will contribute to  raising Thailand’s 
economic potential . 
 
 Monetary and Financial StabilityMonetary Policy Report  March 2015                                   39 3. Monetary and Financial Stability  
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.1 Financial markets   
Overall monetary conditions remained 
accommodative . Money market interest rates 
remained low , in line with the policy interest rate , 
while  government bond yields  declined over the 
same period .  
Money and bond markets  
Overall  monetary conditions continued to 
be accommodative  and supportive of  economic 
recovery, as reflected  by low levels of short -term 
interest rates, close to  the policy interest rate. The 
MPC maintained the policy rate at 2.00 percent at 
the January 28, 2015 meeting, before lowering it 
to 1.75 percent on March 11, 2015 (Chart 3.1 ). 
Moreover, real policy rate (nominal policy rate 
subtracted by 12 -month -ahead  inflation consensus 
forecast) remained negative, although it  edged up  Thailand’s overall economic and financial stability was well maintained. 
Monetary conditions remain ed accommodative and supportive of economic 
growth. Stability of f inancial institutions were stable and continued to  maintain 
previous lending standards, while stability of non-financial institutions strenghten ed 
following economic recovery in 2014 Q4.  
 The Monetary Policy Committee deemed it necessary to monitor the  
following risk factors going forward. (1) Additional monetary policy easing from 
major and regional economies, which may exert upward pressure s on the Thai 
baht, (2) Recovery paths of income and loan repayment abilities, especially 
among high -risk groups such as SMEs, low -income households and agricultural 
households, whose earnings were depressed due to falling agricultural prices, 
and (3) Search -for-yield behavio r among investors, encouraged by a prolonged 
period of low interest rate s, which could lead to the build -up of financial fragility.

11 Mar40    Monetary Policy Report  March  2015  slightly from the previous period due to the  
decline in inflation forecast (Chart 3.2  and Box 
“Understanding  the Real Policy Rate”).  Bank of 
Thailand’s survey of business sentiment  also 
indicated that most businesses did not consider 
the current  level of interest rate s a major 
impediment to  their business operations (Chart 
3.3). Likewise, the cost s of borrowing in the 
financial markets remained low (Chart 3.4).  
Thai government bond yields have declined  
substantially since December 2014, as a result of 
mounting concerns over the recovery of the Thai 
economy as well as  the fragility of the global 
economy. The fall in yields could  also be attributed 
to lower -than-expected inflation as well as the 
growing  demand for Thai bonds by both domestic 
and foreign investors. As of January 14, 2015, the 
10-year government bond yield closed  at 2.49 
percent, the lowest level in six years.  
The government bond yields rose somewhat  
between  the end of January and mid-February 
2015. This was in line with the U.S. treasury yields , 
which climbed  as the U.S. economy and labo r 
market showed steady signs of improvement, 
prompting speculation of an earlier -than-expected 
hike in the federal funds  target  rate. The rise in 
yields also resulted from the offloading  of Thai 
bonds, especially  in the 5 to 15 -year sector , by 
domestic and foreign investors due to profit taking  
and concerns over the Greek debt negotiation. 
However yields  declined slight ly following  the  
policy rate reduction on March 11, 2015, and also 
some  rollover  demand s. On March 11, 2015, the 
government bond yields declined by approximately 
1-15 bps from the previous  day’s close , with the 
10-year yield at 2.74 percent, nearly the lowest 
level in the region. (Chart 3. 5).

Return -seeking behavio r had intensified 
among e quity  investors , but risks to the financial 
system remained contained .  
Given accommodative monetary conditions  
and low level of interest rates, investors sought 
higher returns  both in the Stock Exchange of 
Thailand (SET) and in the Market for Alternative 
Investment (MAI). The SET and the MAI indices, 
therefore, have been on the upward trends since 
the end of 2014, driven mainly by purchases of 
domestic institutional investor s in the SET (Chart 
3.6) and of retail investors in the MAI (Chart 3.7) . 
Although the SET and MAI indices, as well as the 
Forward P/E (Forward Price -Earnings Ratio), 
declined slightly  between March 1 -11, 2015, the 
indices remained elevated and the forward price -
earnings ratio higher than 10 -year historical 
average (Table 3.1) . These indicators signaled 
that mispricing of risks among investors  may be 
developing   
 
 
 
 
It is worth  noting that the amount of credit  
extended by securities companies for investment  
in the stock market have been increasing 
significant ly since 2014 Q3, in line with trading 
volumes in the SET (Chart 3.8 ). Nonetheless, 
most investors still funded their investment 
through their own savings , and therefore  impacts 
of a sudden stock market decline on domestic 
financial market s should be limited.

 Foreign exchange market   
The Thai baht appreciated steadily against 
the U.S. dollar from January to February 2015,  
in line with the effective exchange rate indices. 
The appreciation was  largely  due to additional 
monetary policy easing s in the euro area and 
Japan, as well as a n improvement in Thailand’s 
current account. However, since March 2015, the 
baht has depreciated sharp ly on the back of 
improving  U.S. economic conditions (Chart  3.9). 
With respect to exchange rate volatility, the baht  
volatility  remained relatively low compared to 
regional peers.   
From the beginning of 2015 to February, 
the Thai baht appreciated against U.S. dollar 
because of (1) additional monetary policy easing s 
in major economies, particularly  the 60 -billion euro 
per month asset purchase plan announced by the 
European Central Bank on January 22, 2015,  
and (2) Thailand’s larger -than-expected current  
account surplus from a sharp fall in global oil 
prices and imports of capital goods (Box “Thai 
baht appreciation: its causes, effects, and 
implications on Thai businesses”) .

to depreciate against the U.S. dollar. The shift was 
triggered by  better -than-expected readings of  
the U.S. labo r market indicators , which further 
confirmed solid recovery of the U.S economy  and 
increased the expectation that the Fed would raise 
its policy rate as early as the June  meeting  2015. 
Most recently, after the Monetary Policy Meeting 
on March 11, 2015, the baht closed at 32.92 baht 
per U.S. dollar, a 0.1 percent weaker  than the end 
of 2014.  
The Nominal Effective Exchange Rate 
(NEER) soared  since the beginning of 2015, 
reaching 111.68 in February 2015, a 2.9 percent 
rise since the end of 2014. Consistent with the 
NEER, preliminary data for the Real Effective 
Exchange Rate (REER) in February 2015 indicated  
the index rising to 108.04, suggesting appreciation s 
against most major and regional currencies (Chart 
3.10 and Chart 3.11).   
Regarding developments in major currencies , 
the euro  and the yen depreciated as a result of 
further monetary policy easing s, while the Swiss 
franc appreciated  sharply  after the lifting of the 
exchange rate  floor for the Swiss franc against the 
euro. Meanwhile, c urrencies  of oil-exporting countries  
in the region , such as Indonesia  and Malaysia , 
weak ened following a fall in oil export s. The baht , 
however,  exhibited lower volatility compared to 
regional currencies.  (Chart 3.12 )

business and household credits will pick up 
slightly. Car loans, however, will likely continue  to 
decline. Lending standards are expected to 
remain unchanged from the previous period.  
With regard to  depository institutions,  
the number of special deposit products, as well as 
the deposit rates, declined moderately following 
sluggish demand for loans (Chart 3.16 ). Deposit 
rates of the four largest commercial banks2/ at the 
end of February 2015 were unchanged from the 
end of November 2014. Specifically, the 12 -month 
deposit rates averaged at 1.73 percent.  
In 2014 Q4, new deposits3/ grew,  particularly  
those from household  (Chart 3.17 ). The trend was 
a response to various types of special deposit 
products introduced in the previous quarter by 
financial institutions seeking  additional funding 
amidst signs of economic recovery. The growth of 
deposits and bills of exchange (B/E)  rose from 2.9 
percent in October 2014 to 4.3 percent in January 
2015 (Chart 3.18) . With deposit growth outpacing  
that of credits, commercial banks’ loan to deposit

change in deposits at all depository institutions 
(excluding the Bank of Thailand). Therefore, it includes 
neither transfers of deposits among banks, nor rollovers 
of deposits.

Stability of financial institutions  
Earning s of commercial banks and stability 
of financial institutions in 2014 Q4 remained robust , 
though the economic slowdown had somewhat 
weighed on credit growth . Credit quality remained 
unchanged , while commercial banks stepped up 
their loan loss provision  and continued to maintain  
high level s of capital  in order to cushion against 
economic uncertaint y.  
In 2014 Q4, commercial bank  loans grew 
at 5.0 percent, down from 5.6 percent in the 
previous quarter. Overall loan quality remained 
unchanged , as reflected in the drop in the 
Delinquency and NPL Ratio to 5.5 percent , driven 
mainly by consumer credits  (Chart 3.20) . Also, 
commercial banks’ provision s remained high,  
indicating  the commercial banks’ ability to bear 
additional costs and deteriorated credit qualit y for 
loans . The ratio of actual loan loss provision to 
regulatory loan loss provision and the Capital 
Adequacy Ratio were record ed at 169.4  and 16.8 
respectively.

Stability of the non-financial sectors 
improved  in line with the economic recovery in 
2014 Q4. However, the economic recovery and  its 
impact on the loan repayment ability  of various 
sectors require ongoing monitoring since  the 
recovery thus far has proved to be slower than 
expected due to depressed agricultural prices, 
elevated  household debt, and subdued d emand s 
for real estate given  future income uncertaint y.    
Household sector   
Stability of the household sector remained 
solid, due to low risk of default s. Nevertheless, 
repayment ability of low -income and agricultural 
households could be a  source of  concern, and 
thus warrants monitoring .  
Stability of the household sector was well -
maintained. Household debt slowed due to both 
consumers’ careful  spending behavio r and banks’ 
cautious lending standards. Yet, as the growth of 
household debt still outpaced GDP growth , 
household debt -to-GDP ratio increased moderately  
to 84.7 percent at the end of 2014 Q3 (Table 3.2) . 
Overall, the fragility of the household sector  
remained contained  and d id not pose risks to the 
financial system . The NPL and delinquency ratio  
(share of loans overdue  by over  1 mont h) of 
commercial banks declined from 6.2 percent at the 
end of 2014 Q3 to 5.9 percent at the end of 2014 
Q4 (Table 3.2) . Nonetheless, loan repayment 
risks could rise  among low -income and agricultural 
households (Chart  3.21), given  depressed agricultural  
and non -agricultural earnings.

closely monitor the recovery path  of income s and 
the repayment ability among these vulnerable  
groups.  
Corporate sector  
In 2014 Q4, stability of the corporate 
sector improve d somewhat , owing partly to the 
overall economic recovery. For example, t he retail 
sector expanded in line with  a gradual recovery in 
private consumption. Despite improving retail 
sector , Business Sentiment Index stalled, hovering 
below 50 in the final quarter of 2014 (Chart 3.22).  
In addition, SMEs were  faced with liquidity 
constraint s and strict lending standards by 
commercial banks. As a result, they were more 
fragile compared to large corporate, and hence 
their loan repayment ability need to be monitored 
going forward.  
Meanwhile, the energy sector suffered 
from losses on oil stock  and asset depreciation 
from the sudden plunge  in global oil price s. 
However, the high ratio of retained earnings to 
total assets  should help buffer the loss. Moreover, 
many firms have already taken measures to 
mitigate the oil price risk , for instance by 
implementing cost -cutting strategies and delaying  
investment plans .   
Real estate sector  
Real estate markets in Bangkok and its 
vicinities , especially for condominiums,  may be 
running the risk of  oversupply , due to slower -than-
expected recovery in purchasing power . The issue 
thus require s close monitor ing going forward . 
Demand for housing moderated towards 
the end of 2014 as a result of mounting concerns 
over future economic conditions and income

cautio n on lending  to the sector  by financial 
institutions also contributed to the demand 
slowdown. Thus, the number of condominium 
ownership  registrations contracted compared to  
the same period last year, while the cumulative 
excess supply of condominium in Bangkok and its 
vicinities  continued rising  (Chart 3.23) . As a result, 
income realization was  delayed, hurting the liquidity  
of real estate firms. In the following period, real 
estate supply  is expected to moderate , as some of 
the new project  launches  have be  postponed  
(Chart 3.24) . 
The quality of pre -finance and post -finance 
loans remained steady , suggested by largely 
unchanged Special Mention ratio of commercial 
banks. Also, the NPL Ratio edged down slightly as 
banks have already completed their loan restructuring  
(Chart 3.25 and 3.26) . 
In the following period, the economic 
recovery and consumer confidence in future income  
prospects will be the key determin ants of  housing 
demand . It, therefore , remains to be seen whether 
the improvement in purchasing power will be 
sufficient to absorb existing excess supply.  
Fiscal sector  
The fiscal sector continued to be robust  
overall . The high level of treasury balance helped 
cushion the impact of lower -than-projected  
revenue collection. Meanwhile, the ratio of public 
debt to GDP decreased, after falling state 
enterprises’ foreign debt s as a result of the baht 
appreciation .

reflected by 1) the high level of treasury balance ,

(Post finance )50    Monetary Policy Report  March  2015  expected  revenue col lection. At the end of 
January 2015, treasury balance stood at 116  
billion baht , a level sufficient to provide support  for 
the government when  needed ; and 2) t he ratio of 
public debt to GDP , which  decreased from 47.2 
percent in September to 45.8 percent in December  
2014, well below the fiscal sustainability threshold 
of 60 percent (Chart 3.27) . The decline in the ratio 
was a result of three main factors, namely (1) debt 
repayment of financial and non -financial state -
owned enterprises associated with the Fund for 
Rehabilitation of Foreign Debt Repayment of 
State -owned Enterprises, (2) bond -redemp tion by 
state-owned depository institutions , and (3) downward  
valuation change  from currency appreciation  in 
state enterprises’ debt outstanding.  
Looking ahead, a few risk factors  need to 
be monitored . First, investment in Water Resource 
Management Project and Road Transportation 
Emergency Development Plan would  raise the 
level of government debt. Second , the collection of 
personal income and corporate income taxes may 
be below target this year  should the economic 
recovery continues to disappoint. I n that case, the 
treasury balance will need to be tapped in order to 
fill the revenue gap, as was the case  in 2014. The 
resulting decline in treasury balance will imply 
limited resouces for the government  in the future. 
Nevertheless,  slowdowns in investment from 
downward  adjustments in auction prices  for 
government projects  should help ease pressure 
on the treasury balance in the short run .

 Monetary Policy Report  March 2015   53 Real interest rate: concept and calculation  
In the current environment of falling inflation in line with  the global  lower  crude oil price s, 
real interest rate is increasingly being used in  the analysis of monetary condition and financing 
costs. Nonetheless, different calculati on methods of real interest rate ha ve resulted in differing 
views on  monetary condition and some misinterpretation of monetary policy direction . This article 
aims to e stablish an accurate understanding of real interest rate s, and this in turn should help 
enhance the effectiveness of the BOT’s communication concerning the real interest rate and 
monetary policy stance , consistent  with the monetary policy objectives . 
Real interest rate   
Real interest rate is the nominal interest rate minus the expected inflation.  It is an 
important factor  in the  decision -making process of economic agents such as firms, households 
and other sectors because it better reflects the true opportunity cost of present consumption 
relative to future consumption. In other words, real interest rate represents  future interest income 
in the form that can be used to purchase real goods and services ( real purchasing power ). 
In allocating their budget between spending and saving , most households form 
expectations on future prices of goods  in order to ensure  that future income  is adequate to meet  
future expenses and expected inflation.  Similarly, firms  make their borrowing and investment 
decisions based on their expectation of future prices. For example, retail businesses may decide 
to borrow  at the current nominal rate to finance their business expansion, in anticipation of higher 
revenue as the economy expands . It is clear that  the expect ation of future  prices of goods 
influence  household consumption and business investment decisions in the curre nt 
period. Therefore, it is the expected inflation, rather than current level of inflation, which 
should be used in the calculation  of real interest rate s. 
How is expected inflation assessed ? 
Expected inflation is typically derived via four main method s: (1) household  and business 
surveys on the outlook of future prices of goods and services; (2) survey s of professional 
forecasters working in the financial markets; (3) implied inflation calculated  from inflation -linked 
bond s; and (4) central bank forecasts.  
Preliminary studies show that most central b anks conduct household and business 
surveys to assess the o utlook of  prices of goods and services.1/ However,  in their communication 
with the public,  several central banks use expected inflation obtained  from a variety of methods. 
They also regularly refer to the inflation expectations  via various channels of communication , 
including monetary policy reports and speeches. Some central banks not only communicate the 
developments of expected inflation, but also discuss the limitations of the various methods used to 
assess expected inflation.  For ex ample, at its meeting on January 27 -28, 2015,2/ the Federal 
Open Market Committee (FOMC) deliberated at length on the expected inflation issues because 
different calculation methods produced  differing  results.  In the view of some FOMC members, 
although surveys suggeste d a rather stable outlook of expected inflation, the implied  inflation  
                                         
1/  Central banks that conduct such surveys include those in the U.S., England, the euro area, South Korea 
and Indonesia.  
2/ From the minutes of FOMC meeting on January 27 -28, 2015 (available on the website: http://www. 
federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm ) 54 Monetary  Policy Report  March  2015  (breakeven inflation)  derived from the Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPs)3/ pointed to 
lower expected inflation.  They went on to argue that the stability of the survey -based measures 
should not be taken as providing much assurance, as Japan  in fact already experienced deflation  
in the late 1990s and early 2000s even as their survey -based measures of long -term inflati on 
expectation had not indicated  sustained deflation . Moreover, it remained unc lear whether the 
decline in  breakeven inflation derived from the TIPs yields was being reflected solely by  lower 
expected inflation. Therefore, such information should be used w ith caution in  monetary policy  
deliberations . 
Calculations  of Thailand’s expected inflation  
The r eal policy interest rate is the 
nominal policy interest rate minus the 
expected inflation. Since 2009, Thailand’s 
nominal policy interest rate has remained 
below expected inflation, resulting in a  
period of sustained  negative real interest 
rates (Chart 1) . 
As part of  its monetary policy 
consideration, the MPC monitors the 
development of real interest rate s obtained  
by a variety of  methods  in obtaining the 
expected inflation , recognizing  the limitations  
of each method. For example,  household, 
business and forecasters surveys may  
not have enough frequency and some 
respondents  may attach far too considerable weight to the current  level of inflation . Also,  
the expected inflation derived from  the inflation -linked bonds may be somewhat volatile  if the 
market is illiquid . At present, the real interest rates obtained  through  surveys of professional 
forecasters and business surveys are  comparable and move in line with each othe r. 
The MPC not only pays attention to expected inflation, but also monitors the 
influence of current prices of goods and services on corporate and household sectors.  
The larger -than-anticipated fall in the prices of goods has caused some firms’ revenue s to drop 
sharply than previously  expected. However, interest expenses have not declined  accordingly , and 
therefore potentially  undermine d firms’ ability to repay debt in the current period  and lead to  tighter 
financial conditions. Therefore,  both current prices of goods and services and expected inflation 
can influence income, interest expenses and financial conditions of households and firms.  
In deliberating monetary policy, t he MPC takes into account the issues  above and 
closely monitors information on changing financial conditions. The MPC communicates with 
the public through various  channels, including the MPC edited minutes, the monthly Economic 
and Monetary Conditions and quarterly Monetary Policy Report s, to ensur e efficient and effective 
monetary policy communication.

Amidst the recent Thai baht  
appreciatio n tren d, concerns  are mounting  
over its potential impact on exports and 
economic  recovery . Since the end of 2014 , 
the continuous appreciation of the  Nominal 
Effective Exchange Rate (NEER ) as well as 
the Real Eff ective Exchange Rate (REER ) 
implied  stronger baht relative  to major  
and regional currencies1/ (Chart 1). Such 
development  was due in large part  to a 
sharp depre ciation of the  currencies of 
Thailand’s trading partners and competitors  
as a result of country -specific factors  which 
in turn reflected the fragility of their respective  
economies  in the following aspects;  
1.1 The euro and the yen depreciated due to continued  monetary policy easing s, 
specifically a larger -than-expected quantitative easing (Q E) program  by the European Central 
Bank (ECB) , a series of QE measures by the Bank of Japan , and the lifting of the Swiss franc -
euro exchange rate cap.  
1.2 Regional currencies weakened following the fall in oil price s as well as commodity 
prices.  The prospect of a worsening  export revenue s and fiscal position of oil -exporting 
countries  has led to a depreciation of  the Indonesian rupiah, the Malaysian ringgit  and the 
Russian ruble. Similarly, the currencies of other commodity exporters, such as the Australian 
dollar, lost value  on the back of falling  commodity prices .  
Following a plunge  in global oil prices, Thailand, as a net oil -importing country, 
saw an improvement in its current account  as its oil imports accounted for a relatively 
large share of the GDP compared to its regional peers .2/ As a result, Thailand experienced 
a sharp  fall in import values , while export value s remained largely unchanged  from the 
previous period3/,. Moreover, foreign investor confidence in sound fundamentals of the Thai 
economy helped attract  foreign direct investment. With addit ional QE by the ECB and 
monetary  easing  policies  in other economies, more capital flows are expected to move into 
Thai assets going forward.  
 The Monetary Policy Committee, however, judged that the impact of the  current round 
of ECB’s QE should not be as pronounced as th ose of the F ed for the following reasons .   
(1) Capital flows from the euro area into regional markets  have not increased  
significantly  in recent period s, despite the implementation of QE by the ECB .

banks in the euro area are too fragile to take on additional risks by lending to Asian banks  
despite their improved liquidity positions .  
(3) Portfolio investors in the euro area are known to prefer to invest in countries with 
low risks and high credit ratings, rather than in emerging markets.  
The b aht appreciation trend  has triggered concerns among some  parties  over 
its adverse impact on the already weak exports. An analysis of historical data  reveals that 
the key  determinant of  Thai exports is the economies  of our trading partners4/ (Chart 2). 
Unfortunately, the ongoing slowdown of our major trading partners ’ economies , includin g the 
U.S., euro area, Japan, and  China have stymi ed demand for exports from Asia, leaving 
regional economies to increasing rely on their domestic demand5/ for growth.  The declining 
export s also result ed from  a number of other external and internal factors. First, under the 
changing global trade landscape, Asian exporters stand to benefit less from recovery of G3 
countries (Chart 3).  Second, shifting consumer preferences have rend ered certain products 
obsolete . Thus, producers of those products have experienced slower export growth. This is 
especially the case for high -technology sectors. As for Thailand, the  chronic  lack of investment  
in new technology has led to structural constraints that prevent Thai firms from producing 
products  in demand , such as smart phones and tablets.

growth and imports from Asia -8Monetary Policy Report  March  2015   57 Although the value of Thai baht is not the main determinant of export volume , its rapid 
apprecia tion may hurt certain industries, particularly SMEs with fragile financial conditions and 
liquidity constraints  during the economic slowdown . Firms that face intens e price competition 
and low profit margin s are also likely to be affected. The impact of a currency appre ciation on  
Thai export s can be summarized by 2 main channels  as follows (Chart 4).   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. As e xport revenues are denominated in foreign currencies , the baht appreciation 
will lead to lower revenues in baht term . This hurts firms’ liquidity and financial position s, most 
significantly in sectors with high currency mismatch between revenues and costs. These are 
usually sectors that utilize domestic raw materials, rely heavily on export revenues, but are 
not fully hedged agains t currency risks, such as agricultural, textile, and furniture industries. 
To make matters worse, firms in these sectors are often small  with limited bargaining power s. 
Therefore, they are unable to adjust prices in order to mitigate the impact of currency  
appreciation.  
2. Abilit y of Thai exporters to engage in price competition ha s deteriorated. Export 
volumes in highly price -competitive sectors, such as agricultural and textile, are declining  as a 
result. Because products in these sectors tend to be substitutable , lower prices are key to  
export success. If the currency of a rival country depreciates, in turn making its goods cheaper , 
Thai exporters may immediately lose their market shares. Fortunately, however, the share of 
exports of  these price -sensitive sectors is gradually declining  as domestic labor cost s rose.  
Aside from sensitive industries mentioned above, the effect of strong baht will 
be limited in most industries, especially those in global production chains, such as 
automo tive and parts and electronics parts. Due to  the nature of the contracts and the 
relationship between parent companies and Thai firms within the production chains, it is 
difficult  for the  parent companies  to switch to partners  in a different country. In addition, during 
each trading round, Thai prod ucers can negotiate for the parent companies to shoulder some 
of the currency impact s. Furthermore, a strong baht helps reduce production costs for 
industries with high import conten ts, such as metals and chemical products.

and managements of foreign exchange risks
Source: Interviews of various industry associations58 Monetary Policy Report March  2015  Although firms in some industries will likely be affected by a strong baht, the overall 
impact is considered much smaller than in th e past, due to various forms of adaptations . The 
following are three important adaptations which  helped Thai companies mitigate the impacts 
of currency fluctuations.  
1. Prudent management of foreign -currency revenues  
Thai firms employ various strategies in order to mitigate the impact of strong baht.  
For example, they can match the currencies of their revenues to those of their costs , thus 
creating a so-called natural hedge . Those in electrical appliances, machineries, and automotive  
industries can adjust payment schedules according to currency movements at the time. 
Moreover, many firms continue to seek new markets for exports, while others choose to 
relocate production bases in foreign countries in order to benefit from lower wages.  
2. Use of exchange rate hedging instruments  
Although FX hedging instruments, such as forwards or options, come with costs, they 
can effectively  reduce risks associated with foreign exchange fluctuations. Currently, firms 
that employ these instruments are mostly multinationals or large Thai corporate s. Meanwhile, 
only a small, though increasing, fractio n of small and medium firms use  these products  
regularly  due to lack of understanding and access. Realizing such limitation s, the Bank of 
Thailand, together with commercial banks, has strived  to encourage greater use of hedging 
instruments by  provid ing more information and develop ing affordable products  that would best 
fit the demand of business owners . 
3. Development in manufacturing capacity to produce high -quality and distinct  products .  
This final measure is crucial  in fostering  resiliency to currency  fluctuations  in a 
sustainable manner . Typically, firms whose products  compete mainly on the basis of quality 
will enjoy  high bargaining power s. They are therefore guaranteed  favorable prices  without 
having to rely on  baht weakness . South Korea provides an example of successful 
development of its export s sector  via this avenue.  Last but not least, the current  period of 
relative ly strong baht provides an opportunity  for Thai firms to import capital goods in order to 
upgrade their production capacities . Through such productivity enhancement, the  Thai firms  
will eventually  overcome the structural problem s that have  been plagu ing Thai exports .
