Executive SummaryExecutive summary
Global Economy
Trading partners are expected to grow at a slower pace compared to the previous 
assessment, expanding 3.4% in 2022 and 3.1% in 2023 . This downward revision to trading 
partners’ growth forecasts is due to the impact of high inflation on growth among advanced 
economies. China’s zero-COVID policy also resulted in a temporary slowdown in the country’s 
demand which in turn affected exports in the region. Nonetheless, latest data suggest that the 
outbreak of COVID -19 in China has subsided and containment measures are being relaxed, which 
will pave the way for China’s economic recovery. Global inflation is expected to rise further due 
to elevated energy and commodity prices as a result of the Russia -Ukraine conflict and the ongoing 
global supply disruption which is exacerbated by China’s containment measures. Many central 
banks are likely to tighten monetary policy more aggressively than previously expected due 
to the pickup in inflation and strong economic growth. The resulting tighter financial conditions 
would lead to a slow down in trading partners’ growth in 2023. 
The Thai Economy
The Thai economy is expected to continue expanding at 3.3% in 2022 and 4.2% in 
2023 driven by a continued recovery in foreign tourist arrivals following the faster relaxation of 
border controls in Thailand and other countries, as well as a strong recovery in private consumption in 
line with the recovery in tourism income and purchasing power of high -income households 
(Box: Private Consumption: a key driver of economic growth in the period ahead ). Meanwhile , 
the impact from trading partners’ growth slowdown is expected to be quite limited. The labor 
market and household income is showing signs of improvement as economic activities continue 
to pick up after containment measures are relaxed. However, net farm income is expected to 
remain largely stable or only slightly increase because while agricultural prices have increased , 
the costs of chemical fertilizers have also increased. (Box: Farm income outlook for 2022 amidst 
impacts of the Russia -Ukraine conflict ). Assessment of the Economic and Inflation Outlook
On the whole , there is a possibility that the Thai economy will register higher growth than 
expected. This is because (1) the number of foreign arrivals might turn out higher than expected as 
border controls in both Thailand and abroad are lifted, and (2) the recovery in domestic demand 
might be stronger than expected as pent-up demand and spending by households with excess savings 
could result in higher -than-expected private consumption. 
Inflation
Headline inflation is expected to be 6.2% in 2022 and 2.5% in 2023. It is expected that 
headline inflation will remain above the target range throughout 2022 before falling into 
the target range in 2023. Rising inflation is attributed to higher domestic energy prices as result of 
higher global crude oil prices. Higher cost pass -through in Thailand has now propagated across more 
categories of goods, though it is assessed that it is mainly due to cost-push inflation. 
There remains the risk that headline inflation could turn out higher than expected.
These upside risks include higher -than-expected energy prices and cost pass -through , change in the 
public’s inflation expectations and behavior that could lead to persistently higher core inflation, and 
potentially higher demand -pull inflationary pressures as the economy recovers.
Nevertheless, medium -term inflation expectations remain well -anchored within the target
range although short -term inflation expectations have increased somewhat . Going forward, t he MPC 
will closely monitor inflation developments, cost pass -through by businesses, and medium -term 
inflation expectations.
6/72Executive summary
Financial Conditions and Financial Stability
Overall financial conditions in Thailand remain accommodative. Financing costs
are low and financing amount continues to grow. Nevertheless, financing conditions 
have tightened somewhat due to heightened volatilities in the global financial market. 
On exchange rates, the baht against U.S. dollar depreciated in Q2/2022 due to market 
concerns that the Fed would tighten monetary policy more aggressively, as well as 
concerns pertaining to the Russia -Ukraine conflict that is still ongoing. Financial 
stability remains sound overall. Commercial banks’ capital funds and reserves 
remain at high levels. Overall liquidity in the system also remains ample, although 
the distribution is still somewhat uneven across different economic sectors. Some 
households and businesses are still vulnerable and thus it would be necessary to 
closely monitor households’ debt serviceability, especially of low -income households
that are affected by higher living costs and are heavily indebted. The MPC assesses 
that household spending has recently been more affected by inflation than by higher 
interest rates. As such, preventing inflation from remaining persistently high to the 
point that it affects the costs of living is vital to the livelihood of the people.Monetary Policy Decision in the Second Quarter of 2022
At the meeting on 8 June 2022, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 4 to 3 to 
maintain the policy rate at 0.50 percent . Three members voted to raise the policy rate by 
0.25 percentage point. The MPC assesses that the Thai economy will continue to recover and 
could expand faster than previously expecte d owing to stronger domestic demand and the pickup 
in foreign tourists. Headline inflation would increase and remain elevated for longer than previously 
estimated, due to the increase in oil prices and higher cost pass -through. The MPC view that a 
very accommodative monetary policy stance will be less needed going forward. However, to 
ensure that the recovery will continue to gain traction as anticipated, most members voted 
to maintain the policy rate in this meeting and will reassess the risks to growth and inflation 
going forward. Meanwhile, three members view that policy normalization is warranted in this 
meeting given the increased upside risks to both growth and inflation.
The MPC will assess the appropriate timing for a gradual policy normalization in 
accordance with the shift in the outlook and risks surrounding growth and inflation . 
The MPC sees the need to monitor (1) the continuity of the economic recovery, especially the 
recovery of domestic demand and tourism which is the key driver of growth; (2) risks to inflation
especially the trajectory of oil prices, higher cost pass -through, and possible acceleration in 
demand -pull inflationary pressures in tandem with the economic recovery (Box: Underlying 
inflation indicators for Thailand ); and (3) financial stability in Thailand, especially fragile households
and businesses who have yet to fully recover and are highly indebted as they are vulnerable to 
increases in the living and production costs. In addition, the MPC view that the implementation
of measures targeted at vulnerable groups must continue, especially the restructuring of 
debt to be consistent with borrowers’ long -term debt serviceability.

Inflation is rising in many countries 
as a result of the Russia -Ukraine 
conflict as well as the global supply 
disruption which is exacerbated by 
lockdowns in ChinaGlobal Economy: Key Issues
The overall COVID -19 situation has 
improved. This has led to the 
relaxation of containment measures in 
many countries except in China where 
lockdowns remain in place. Trading partners posted strong 
growth rates, albeit lower than 
previously assessed due to 
the impact of accelerating inflation 
and monetary policy tightening.

Global Economy
The number of COVID -19 Omicron cases has declined 
from Q1/2022, partly due to accelerated vaccination efforts
including booster shots being more widely administered 
in many countries. Containment measures have been 
progressively relaxed with many countries except China , 
as they opted to live alongside COVID such as the U.S., 
Europe, South Korea, and Singapore. As a result , the economic
impact has been less severe than previously expected.
Nevertheless , some Asian economies like China, Taiwan, 
and Hong Kong have faced more severe outbreak than 
previously expected. China has implemented strict 
containment measures in April, which impacted domestic 
economic activities. However, latest data suggests that the 
number of COVID -19 cases in China and Hong Kong has 
declined significantly. The COVID -19 situation has improved. Many countries have continued to relax containment measures which have led to a 
recovery in economic activities, except in some Asian economies where the outbreak is still ongoing.

The COVID -19 outbreak in China is subsiding, as reflected by the significant decline in the number of cases and gradual 
re-opening of the manufacturing sector. The logistics sector, however, remain affected. 
The COVID -19 situation in China has progressively improved and the outbreak
is likely to be under control. The number of cases has declined especially in 
Shanghai where the recent outbreak was severe, while the outbreak in Beijing 
has not been severe . Lockdowns have mostly been imposed on the general 
population , while manufacturing businesses in outbreak areas have now been 
allowed to resume operations under closed -loop management since mid -April. 
Under this system, workers are allowed to return to work and live only in 
designated areas. In addition, 90% of factories in Shanghai are now operational 
especially those in the automobile , semiconductors , and other key industries 
although they are not yet operating at full production capacity due to movement
restrictions. This is reflected in the uptick in China’s latest PMI data in May. 
However, China’s domestic and international logistics are still affected by 
the outbreak as reflected in longer shipping times. The time it takes to load 
and unload goods at the Port of Shanghai has almost doubled even though 
some ships now use other nearby ports instead. On the whole , it is expected 
that logistics will gradually improve as the outbreak subsides.

The impact from the Russia -Ukraine conflict has been as expected. Energy and commodity prices are still high and would 
remain so throughout 2022. 
The impact of the Russia -Ukraine conflict on economic growth 
and energy and commodity prices, and the sanctions on Russia 
were largely as expected. It is expected that these impacts would
continue throughout 2022. 
The Russia -Ukraine conflict has resulted in higher energy and commodity
prices, which in turn affected the costs for both producers and 
consumers. Meanwhile, the global supply disruption is likely to 
persist while Russia -Ukraine conflict is still ongoing. Russia is a major 
exporter of energy and commodities such as oil, natural gas, raw metal , 
nickel, fertilizers, and palladium which is used in making semiconductors . 
Meanwhile, Ukraine is a major exporter of grains, pig iron, and animal
feed. However, in April, concerns about the war has somewhat 
receded from the prior month. The sanctions on Russia is still largely 
the same and is likely to remain in effect for extended period as 
previously expected.

Inflation and inflation expectations in many countries have increased due to high energy and commodity prices as well 
as impact of the ongoing global supply disruption.
Overall, inflation and inflation expectations in many countries 
have increased due to higher energy and commodity prices as a 
result of the Russia -Ukraine conflict. Inflation in advanced economies 
rose with the economic recovery and higher energy prices. Meanwhile, 
rising inflation in Asian economies were mostly felt by net energy 
importers such as South Korea and Singapore. Nevertheless, inflation 
among Asian economies has not yet reached levels seen among advanced 
economies, partly due to government measures such as energy price 
controls, energy -related tax reductions, and government subsidies. 
The global supply disruption remains a challenge due to lockdowns
in China, as reflected by the delivery time and container price indices 
remaining at high levels. Both are among factors that contribute to 
higher costs and higher inflation. Nevertheless, in the short -term, 
container prices have declined slightly thanks to better distribution of 
freight container across Asia after China’s demand for freight container
receded due to the lockdowns.

in China where lockdowns remain in place in key cities. Nevertheless, private consumption in the period ahead would be 
weighed down by the Russia -Ukraine conflict and the impact of rising inflation on consumer purchasing power. 
Overall, private consumptions has improved thanks to containment measures being relaxed in many countries. The number of COVID -19cases 
in many countries have already passed their peaks. Meanwhile, private consumption in China has declined due to the strict lockdowns  although
this is likely to resolve within Q 2/2022. 
However, the recovery in private consumption would still be weighed down by concerns over the Russia -Ukraine conflict and the impact of 
persistently high inflation on consumer purchasing power. This is reflected by the decline in consumer confidence index in ma ny countries,

Many central banks are likely to tighten monetary policy more aggressively than previously expected given rising 
inflation and strong economic recovery.
The Federal Reserve (Fed) accelerated its policy normalization in response to the U.S. 
economy growing at near -potential, tight labor market conditions, as well as high and 
rising inflation. Looking ahead, it is expected that the Fed would tighten its monetary 
policy stance further, raising its policy rate at every remaining FOMC meeting in 2022. This is 
because inflation is likely to remain high throughout the year as a result of the Russia -
Ukraine conflict and the worsening global supply disruption from strict lockdowns in China. 
The Fed also announced that it would reduce the size of its USD 8.9 trillion balance sheet 
(quantitative tightening : QT) starting in June 2022. 
Asian central banks are likely raisetheir policy rates in tandem with the Fed’s 
policy rate hikes given the pickup in inflation in many countries and the gradual 
economic recovery. Some central banks in the region have already raised its policy 
rates namely the central banks in South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong, 
Malaysia, and the Philippines . Bank Indonesia (BI) has also started to signal a tighter 
monetary policy stance. Meanwhile, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) announced a 
reduction in the loanprimerate(LPR)and the required reserve ratio(RRR)to support 
economic growth in 2022 which has slowed down due to lockdowns being reinstated 
in China.

Source: BOT projections (as of 20 May 22 )Factors influencing Asian countries’ monetary policy (excluding China)Global Economy
Thailand’s trading partners are expected to post strong economic growth in 2022 albeit at a slower pace than previously 
assessed due to rising inflation and lockdowns in China. Trading partners’ growth forecast for 2023 is revised down slightly
on account of softer growth momentum and tighter -than-expected financial conditions. 
Trading partners are expected to post strong economic growth in 2022 
albeit at a slower pace than previously assessed. Growth among 
advanced economies would decelerate due to rising inflation, while 
growth among Asian economies would be affected by the temporary 
slowdown in demand from China. Lockdowns in China would impact the 
manufacturing sector and demand in China, and lead to growth slowdown 
among Asian economies. However, China’s growth is largely unchanged 
because of better -than-expected growth outturns in Q1/2022 and the 
relaxation of control measures in the Chinese property market.
For 2023, trading partners’ growth is expected to slow down due to 
softer growth momentum in 2022 and tighter -than-expected financial
conditions due to the Fed and many Asian central banks being more 
aggressive in monetary policy tightening than previously expected.

Private ConsumptionPrivate consumption growth is revised up on account of a 
stronger -than-expected recovery in economic activities in Q1/2022 
and the gradual recovery of the service sector. Looking ahead, there 
remain downside risks stemming from higher living costs. Private consumption will continue to grow after the 
COVID -19 outbreak subsides and employment gradually 
recovers on the back of the tourism sector, leading to 
improvements in income and household purchasing power. 
Private InvestmentPrivate investment will continue to expand on account of a stronger -than-expected recovery in economic activities in 
Q1/2022 and investment exhibiting signs of improvement especially large and medium -sized businesses. Notwithstanding, 
private investment growth could be weighed down by delays in public private partnership (PPP) projects.  
Merchandise exports 
(value)Merchandise exports growth will be stronger than previously assessed mainly due to high commodity prices even though 
exports quantity would decline due to the economic slowdown among trading partners. 
Foreign touristsForeign tourists figures is revised up from the previous assessmen t 
from 5.6 million persons to 6 million persons. This is due to 
border controls in many countries including Thailand being lifted 
sooner than expected, which will result in higher foreign tourist 
arrivals in the H1/2022 than previously assessed. Foreign tourist figures remain unchanged from the previous
assessment at 19 million persons. It is expected that the 
number of Chinese tourists would start to recover after 
China removes foreign travel restrictions in 2023 once the 
COVID -19 pandemic subsides . Overview of economic forecasts
Box: consumptionBox : Private consumption: Akey driver of growth in the period ahead
22/72The Thai Economy
Private consumption was affected by the multiple waves of COVID -19 
outbreak over the past 2 years, which resulted in subdued economic activities and a 
significant decline in household income especially for those working in tourism -
related sectors. Looking ahead, however, private consumption is likely to make 
a strong recovery and become a key driver of growth for the Thai economy
especially once the pandemic subsides, people become more accustomed to living 
with COVID -19, and the government relaxes border controls and containment 
measures. Factors underpinning the recovery in private consumption are as follow:
(1) Household income would recover alongside tourism. So far, the 
recovery of household income has been slow especially for the self -employed and 
workers in the tourism -related services. However, the gradual return of foreign 
tourists after international travel restrictions are lifted would lead to improvements 
in household income which would underpin the recovery of private consumption. 
(2) Consumption spending by high-income households will return to 
pre-COVID trajectory. Households were not able to participate in activities or go 
out to spend as much as they wish to due to the COVID -19 outbreak and 
containment measures imposed by the government. As a result, there was 
pent-up demand as reflected by the recent pickup in consumption spending 
once containment measures were relaxed, especially spending in services . Box 1: Private consumption: a key driver of growth in the period ahead
High-income households, which generally spends more on services than other 
income groups1/, still possess purchasing power as their excess saving has increased. 
This is reflected by the outstanding balance of personal savings accounts with a 
balance of more than 1 million baht per account, which has grown 12% from pre -
COVID levels (Figure 1). It is expected that spending by high -income households 
will continue to expand and return to the pre-COVID trajectory seen in 2018-2019 
(Figure 2). Their spending on services , in particular, would support the income recovery 
of workers in the service sector, who are mostly medium -income and low -income 
earners, and in turn support continued private consumption growth.
Nevertheless, while private consumption is expected to see a strong recovery 
thanks to the aforementioned factors, there are risks that remain to be 
monitored . Such risks include the higher costs of living and debt burden of 
households, especially among low -income households who are more affected by rising 
food prices than other income groups whereas their income might not have fully 
recovered during the initial stages of the recovery. 
1/The proportion of spending on services of total spending for low -income, medium -
income, and high -income households are 40%, 40%, and 45%, respectively.

26/72Value of merchandise exports growth is expected to expand on the back of higher oil and commodity prices, while 
export quantity would decline slightly with the slowdown in trading partners’ demand.  
•Export prices are likely to increase to a level that is higher than 
previously expected due to higher prices of oil and goods such as 
agricultural products, food , iron, and chemicals in the global market. 
•Global trade volume would decelerate in the period ahead. This is 
mainly due to the slow down in demand from advanced economies and 
China, and the expectations that consumers from those markets would shift 
more of their spending towards services and tourism after containment 
measures are relaxed in many countries. 
•Exports of agricultural products to China, especially fruits, are affected 
by China’s stringent zero-COVID policy, which affects international shipping 
and raises costs for quality control. 
•Exports of computer parts, IC, and electrical appliances might be affected
by lockdowns in key cities in China, which exacerbates the ongoing shortage of 
raw materials.

27/72•Foreign tourist figures projection for 2022 is revised up mainly on account of 
the faster -than-expected relaxation of border controls in Thailand and abroad. 
So far, the number of foreign tourists has continued to rise since travel restrictions
in Thailand and abroad were gradually relaxed. 
•Foreign tourist figures projection for 2023 remains unchanged. It is expected 
that the number of foreign tourists will increase as tourism confidence improves 
once the COVID -19 pandemic subsides and vaccination becomes widespread 
globally. The increase would also be driven by the return of Chinese tourists as 
it is expected that the Chinese government will relax international travel 
restrictions in 2023. Foreign tourist figures are likely to turn out higher than previously assessed due to the faster -than-expected relaxation of 
travel restrictions in Thailand and abroad.

Box 2 : Farm in come outlook for 2022 amidst 
impacts from the Russia -Ukraine conflict
Labor market conditions and non -farm income are expected to improve as economic activities pick up although they remain 
below pre -COVID levels. 
Unemployed and underemployed figures has continued to decline in Q1/2022 as economic activities recover. It is still necessary to monitor long -term unemployment 
and the number of those unemployed with no prior work experiences, which remain high, given that the unemployed could lose th eirskills and unable to return to the labor 
force over the longer -term. Looking ahead , non-farm income is expected to gradually recover but still remains below pre -COVID levels . Meanwhile, farm income is 
expected to remain largely stable or increase only slightly because while agricultural prices have increased, the costs of chemical fertilizers have also increased.

30/72Box 2: Farm income outlook for 2022 amidst impacts from the Russia -Ukraine conflict
On the whole , net farm income in 2022 might remain largely stable or increase 
only slightly, varying across agricultural products. This is because while the Russia -
Ukraine conflict will lead to higher prices for several agricultural products, input costs 
have also gone up especially chemical fertilizers and animal feed. 
Farm income (before deducting costs)1/is expected to grow 9.3 % in 2022 owing 
to higher agricultural prices but input costs have also gone up. Russia, the world’s 
number one exporter of chemical fertilizer, has ceased exports in retaliation to the 
sanctions imposed on them. As a result, the average price of chemical fertilizers in the 
global market between Jan -Apr 2022 grew as much as 127.6% YoY, a continued increase 
from the 80.5% growth seen in 2021. For animal feed, both Russia ( number one exporter of 
wheat) and Ukraine (a major corn producer) are unable to export their goods due to the 
war. Thus, average wheat and corn prices in the global market between Jan -Apr 2022 grew 
26.2%YoY and 54.2% YoY, respectively (Chart 1). It is also expected that wheat and corn 
prices will remain high throughout the rest of the year. 
1/The number of w orkers in the agricultural sector (seasonally adjusted) increased to 12.3 million persons in Q1/2022 
compared to 11.7 million persons in pre -COVID. However, the average farm income (before deducting gross) is still 
lower than the average non -farm income in 2021 by as much as 25%. 0100200300400

31/72Net farm income in 2022 will vary across different agricultural products and will 
be subjected to the following uncertainties:
(1) Those that will see their net income decline due to higher input costs are 
rice and fruit farmers, which together make up 67% of all farmers in Thailand2/. Most rice 
farmers3/will see a decline in their net income because rice prices in the market are still 
below the price guaranteed by the government. Hence, rice farmers who sells their rice at 
the guaranteed price will see no change in their income, but they would still face higher 
input costs due to usage of oil4/and chemical fertilizers which constitute as much as 30% of 
the total input costs. Meanwhile, fruit farmers are most vulnerable to net income loss 
because not only are they faced with higher input costs as other farmers, theyare also 
subject to the Chinese demand slowdown due the strict zero-COVID policy. As a result, 
the average prices of fruits between Jan -Apr 2022 contracted by 14.7 % YoY. Almost all fruits are 
affected including durian and longan which are among Thailand’s most important fruit products .Box 2: Farm income outlook for 2022 amidst impacts from the Russia -Ukraine conflict
2/Thaifarmers performs a total 1.4 agricultural activities (types of crop/animals) per household on average 
therefore the sum of farmers in this analysis (1) + (2) + (3) will total more than 100%. 
3/Some farmers who are off -season rice farmers (about 0.5 million households) might not see their net 
income decline because of high crop yields this year due to abundance of water from the dams 
and rainfall during the draught season.  Meanwhile, most farmers (about 4.1 million households) are 
in-season rice farmers.

32/72(2)Those whose net income will be largely unaffected are rubber, cassava, 
livestock, and off -season rice farmers which make up 43% of all farmers in Thailand. 
It is expected that rubber and cassava prices will not increase much despite their 
correlation with energy prices5/because demand for those crops is concentrated in 
China and is consequently affected by China’s zero -COVID policy. The average 
prices of rubber and cassava between Jan -Apr 2022 increased 7.1 % YoY and 11.7% YoY, 
respectively. However, the price increases were still outpaced by the increase in costs of 
chemical fertilizers hence net income is largely unaffected. Meanwhile, the average 
prices of pork, broiler chicken, and eggs between Jan -Apr 2022 grew 22.1% YoY, 
16.9% YoY, and 12.1 % YoY, respectively. Said increases were a result of higher animal 
feed cost pass -through from farmers to the consumers and a way for farmers to 
recuperate the sunk costs they incurred due to the swine flu pandemic. As such, income 
of livestock farmers remained largely unaffected on the whole . 
(3)Those whose net income will see growth are oil palm, sugarcane, and 
corn farmers which make up 18% of all farmers in Thailand. This group of farmers 
will benefit from higher prices. The average prices of oil palm, sugarcane, and corn 
between Jan -Apr 2022 grew 65.0% YoY, 16.3% YoY, and 13.3 % YoY, respectively. The 
increase was due to the Russia -Ukrain e conflict resulting in a global shortage of corn , 
soybeans , and sunflower seeds, which in turn led to increases in prices of other 
vegetable oil substitutes as well as palm oil and sugarcane in the global market6/.  Sugarcane farmers also benefited from high crop output which is expected to see 28.2% 
YoY growth thanks to adequate rainfall. In this regard, it is expected that this group of 
farmers will see strong income growth in 2022 that would also outpace increases in 
the costs of chemical fertilizers which constitute 21.5 -30.0% of total input costs for 
this group of farmers.
In summary, the Russia -Ukraine conflicted resulted in an overall increase in 
agricultural prices but input costs have also increased. As such, it is expected that 
net income for most farmers in 2022 will either be largely affected or increase 
slightly at varying degrees across different groups of farmers. Looking ahead, there 
remain uncertainties pertaining to the Russia -Ukraine conflict and the global economic 
outlook which could present both upside and downside risks to agricultural prices, input 
costs, and net income for the farmers. As such, it is necessary to monitor the situation 
closely given its implications to the livelihood of farmers and Thailand’s economic recovery
in the period ahead. Box 2: Farm income outlook for 2022 amidst impacts from the Russia -Ukraine conflict

•A stronger rebound in the number of foreign tourists than previously 
expected given that Thailand and other countries have relaxed border 
controls faster than expected. 
•Stronger -than-expected recovery in in domestic demand, especially 
as private consumption might register stronger growth than expected 
due to pent -up demand . Once the COVID -19 outbreak in Thailand subsides , 
those with excess savings might feel less concerned and spend more 
than previously expected. 
Factors that would result in growth underperforming the baseline
•Trading partners’ growth slowdown, especially advanced economies 
and China. Growth slowdown in advanced economies could impact 
other countries including China and result in a global economic slowdown . 
Furthermore, the ongoing supply disruption in manufacturing and global 
trade could worsen if the COVID -19 outbreak in China lasts longer than 
what is expected in the baseline. These factors would in turn impact Thai 
exports in the period ahead. There isapossibility thatThailand’s economic growth could outperform thebaseline projections ifthenumber of

34/72Core inflation in the first two months of Q2/2022 averaged 
2.14%, increasing from 1.43% in the previous quarter. The 
increase was mainly attributed to higher food prices as prices of 
prepared food and seasoning and condiments rose in tandem 
with higher input costs. Inflation in non -food categories were 
attributed to higher prices of personal care, and cleaning 
supplies which was also driven by higher input costs. Headline inflation in the first two months of Q 2/2022 
averaged 5.87%, increasing from 4.75% in the previous 
quarter. Energy price inflation was attributed to higher retail 
fuel prices as a result of the Russia -Ukraine conflict, and higher 
electricity costs from Ft adjustments . Fresh food price inflation 
was attributed to higher egg prices as a result of higher animal 
feed costs, and higher fruit prices as fruit exports improved. Headline inflation in Q2/2022 increased from the previous quarter. The increase was mainly attributed to higher core inflation 
and increases in energy prices.

Headline inflation is expected to average 6.2% in 2022 and 2.5% in 2023 due to domestic energy prices, higher cost pass -through , 
the upcoming minimum wage increase, and further cost pass -through in 2023. 
Note: ( ) previous forecast from Monetary Policy Report March 2022
Source: Ministry of Commerce, BOT calculation
•Energy prices
Global oil prices will rise further due to the latest EU sanctions on Russian oil. Retail fuel 
prices in Thailand will also increase due to higher energy costs.
•Cost pass -through from businesses
Production costs will rise due to higher energy and commodity prices. Businesses will be 
less able to absorb the costs and will subsequently pass it down to consumers via 
prices of goods and services. 
•Minimum wage increase
Costs of producing goods and services will be higher due to higher average wage and 
will be passed down to consumer prices in 2023.

The Thai Economy
•Trading partner economies’ growth is revised down throughout the forecast period due to 
higher living costs in line with higher inflation, as well as tighter monetary policy stances 
weighing down on consumption, especially in US and the EU. The Russia -Ukraine conflict being 
prolonged would also affect investors ’ sentiment. 
•The Federal Funds Rate is expected to be raised more aggressively. It is expected that the 
Fed would raise the policy rate at every remaining FOMC meeting in 2022 in response to high 
inflationary pressure that is more persistent than expected. 
•Regional currencies (excluding the Chinese yuan) would depreciate throughout the forecast 
period due to the Fed’s more aggressive policy rate hike and the slowdown in Asia’s exports 
as a result of the COVID -19 outbreak in China. However, regional currencies are expected to 
see some appreciation in the period ahead as Asia’s economic fundamentals improve with the 
relaxation of containment measures and international travel restrictions. 
•Dubai crude oil prices would be higher throughout the forecast period due to EU ban on oil 
imports from Russia.
•Farm income (excluding government support measures) would be higher in 2022 due to 
price increases to pass the higher costs of fertilizers and animal feed through to consumers, as 
well as higher prices in the global market especially for palm oil, chicken eggs, chicken meat, 
and cassava. Farm income growth would subsequently decline in 2023 due to the high -base effect .
•Public spending at current prices is revised down mainly on account of delays in SOE investment . 
Government consumption spending in Q1/2022 is revised down in accordance with actual 
outturns although it is expected to continue expanding in the period ahead.

40/72Assumptions for Dubai crude oil prices
Dubai crude oil prices is expected to be higher than previously assessed due to the latest EU ban on oil imports  from Russia. 
Dubai crude oil price forecasts are revised up from 100 to 105 U.S. dollar per 
barrel in 2022, and from 90 to 105 U.S. dollar per barrel in 2023 due to
•The recent EU ban on oil import from Russia resulting in higher -than-
expected price outturns and possibly lower crude oil supply than previously 
assessed. It is expected that the ban on import of crude oil and refined oil 
products will take effect within 6 and 8 months from the announcement date, 
respectively.
Risks to Dubai crude oil price forecasts remain tilted to the upside 
•Upside risks: the Russia -Ukraine conflict could further escalate, spread to other 
regions, and be more drawn out than previously expected. 
•Downside risks: Lockdowns in China lasting longer than expected ,dampening 
oil demand. Iran might also ramp up its oil production if the nuclear agreement 
with the U.S. is reached. 30507090110

overall despite increases in

43/72Government bond yields continued to rise since the end of the previous quarter due to the expectations that the MPC could raise the policy rate 
sooner and the recent increases in US treasury yields as a result of the Fed’s monetary policy tightening. The credit spread for bonds with less than 
3 year to maturity declined slightly although the credit spread for bonds with BBB credit rating remained high. On the whole , the higher financing 
costs faced by the private sector did not affect financing activities. Businesses have gradually obtained financing in the prior period and is 
expected to continue seeking more financing as the economic recovery gains traction. Government bond yields increased but did not impact financing activities overall.

Q1/22Private credit is expected to pick up as the economic recovery continues. 
In Q1/2022, large corporates (credit limit > 500 million baht ) continued to be 
able to obtain financing. Corporate loans grew across many sectors driven by the 
need for working capital given higher input costs, for financing business operations in 
line with the recovery in economic activities, and for exporting goods. Corporate 
bond issuance also continued to expand mainly driven by the need to repay 
maturing debt and the need for more working capital.
SME loans (credit limit ≤ 500million baht )grew at about the same pace as 
before, mainly supported by the soft loan facility, especially loans extended to 
businesses in commerce and manufacturing sectors. 
Household credit growth slowed down in line with the decline in household 
confidence during the outbreak of the Omicron variant. 
For Q2/20222/it is expected that corporate credit demand would continue to grow 
across all sectors given financing needs for working capital purposes and exports, 
which are in line with the ongoing economic recovery. Household credit is expected 
to pick up as household confidence improve due to the limited economic impact of 
Omicron.

•In Q2/2022, the baht averaged 34.13 baht per U.S. dollar, a depreciation from the previous quarter in line with regional currencies. Global financial market 
volatility also increased as risk -off sentiment prevails among investors due to concerns that the Fed might raise rates more aggressively in response to higher 
inflation, and concerns pertaining to the Russia -Ukraine conflict that is still ongoing.  On the whole , the baht depreciated 2.8% from end -2021, a smaller depreciation 
than other regional currencies. There is also continued capital inflow into Thai assets driven by expectations of an economic recovery i n the latter half of the year. 
•The nominal effective exchange rate (NEER )averaged 116. 3, largely unchanged from the previous quarter mainly due to the appreciation of the Russian ruble and 
U.S. dollar, and the depreciation of the yen. Thebaht depreciated inlinewithregional currencies duetoconcerns thattheFedmight raise rates more aggressively

of the economic recovery. 
3 members voted to raise 
the policy rate by 0.25

The financial system remains 
stable overall but some 
households and businesses are 
still vulnerable and could be 
further affected by higher living

for longer than previously 
estimated and is subjected to 
more upside risks. 
Monetary Policy Decision
50/72The MPC voted 4 to 3 to keep the policy rate on hold. All members agreed that a very accommodative monetary policy 
will be less needed going forward. 
The MPC will assess the appropriate timing for a gradual policy normalization 
in accordance with the shift in the outlook and risks surrounding growth and 
inflation. 0.50%MPC Meeting No. 3/22 
(8 Jun 2022 )
MPC voted 4to 3
to maintain the policy rate at Most MPC members view that the policy rate should be maintained at this 
meeting to ensure that the recovery will continue to gain traction as 
anticipated. Three MPC members view that policy normalization is warranted 
given the increased upside risks to both growth and inflation.The MPC assesses that the Thai economy will continue to recover and could 
expand faster than previously expected owing to stronger domestic demand 
and the pickup in the number of foreign tourists. Headline inflation would 
increase and remain elevated for longer than previously estimated due to 
the increase in oil prices and the higher and more persistent cost passthrough . 
Looking ahead, the MPC views that a very accommodative monetary policy 
will be less needed going forward.
The financial system remains resilient overall. However, some households 
and businesses remain vulnerable to rising living and production costs. The 
MPC sees the need to continue implementing debt restructuring measures as 
well as measures targeted for the vulnerable groups. 3 members voted to raise 
the policy rate by 0.25 percentage pointMonetary Policy Decision
Going forward, the MPC will formulate their policy decisions by taking into account the following key factors affecting 
the economic outlook, inflation, and financial stability
1Economic growth:
Domestic demand and tourism –the key growth drivers for the Thai economy.  
2Inflation: 
Energy price outlook, cost pass -through , and the potential acceleration in 
demand -pull inflationary pressure from the economic recovery
3Financial stability: 
Debt serviceability of households affected by higher living costs

•Upside risks : Fiscal constraints could limit fuel price subsidies through both excise tax 
policy and the oil fund. This could result in a sharper increase in oil prices than the 
level envisioned by the Ministry of Energy. Refined oil product prices in Singapore are higher than Dubai crude oil prices
•Upside risks :The refined oil product market might tighten due to (1) sanction on oil 
imports from Russia which could cause many countries to import oil from other markets 
instead; and (2) the global and regional economy might recover faster than expected.
•Downside risks :Oil demand could decline as the global economy slows down due to 
rising energy and commodity prices, as well as higher global interest rates. Risks to Dubai crude oil prices remain tilted to the upside
•Upside risks : The Russia -Ukraine conflict could escalate, and last longer than previously

58/72In general, headline inflation is calculated from the year -on-year 
change in the consumer price index (CPI), in which some goods and 
services within the CPI basket could be affected by temporary shocks that 
cause large fluctuations in inflation that the indicator may not best reflect 
the underlying inflation trend. As such, calculating and monitoring underlying
inflation indicators is important as it helps policymakers to assess and 
predict inflationary pressures more accurately. The BOT currently monitors 
the following indicators of underlying inflation: 
(1) Core CPIis an underlying inflation indicator that permanently 
excludes inflation in food and energy prices from the CPI basket (fixed -
item exclusion) given that prices in said categories tend to be more 
volatile in the short -term due to supply -side factors. Core CPI is widely 
used by many central banks around the world as it is simple and easy to 
communicate with the public. However, the permanent exclusion of food 
and energy prices also means that some information pertaining to the 
inflation trend in certain periods is lost. For instance, if food and energy 
prices during that period reflect the underlying inflation trend and is not 
undergoing short -term volatilities. On the contrary, if prices of goods and 
services that were not excluded undergoes short -term volatilities, the Core CPI
will also be volatile and won’t reflect the inflation trend as well as it should . Box 3: Underlying inflation indicators for Thailand
(2)Core CPIexcluding rent andmeasures is an underlying inflation 
indicator that excludes changes in the rent and effect of government measures
from the Core CPI. The reasons for said exclusion are as follow: 
•Rent: Rent has a large weight in the Core CPI (21.8%). Changes in rent 
prices have also been quite low in recent period , partly because the 
survey sample is seldomly changed and renters rarely increase rent. For 
these 2 reasons, excluding rent from the Core CPI would allow the 
indicator to better reflect price movements in other categories and 
hence the underlying inflationary pressure. 
•Government measures and tax measures such as water bill reduction, 
tuition fee assistance, and excise taxes on cigarettes, which affect prices 
of some goods and services, could distort the interpretation of the 
underlying inflation trend. This is because government measures typically 
presents a one -time shock that does not truly affect the underlying 
inflationary pressure. As such, excluding government measures and tax 
measures until their effect dissipate would allow the indicator to better 
reflect the underlying inflation trend.  Monetary Policy Decision
59/72(3) Symmetric trimmed mean CPIis an underlying inflation indicator
that excludes some goods or services whose prices have changed significantly
during that period (period -by-period exclusion) equally between those 
whose price have increased and decreased. The symmetric trimmed mean 
CPI differs from the Core CPI in that the goods and services excluded are 
not necessarily from the same category across the different time periods. 
In determining how much goods and services are excluded, excluding
too much could result in the indicator not accurately reflecting the underlying
inflation trend, while too little would leave some short -term volatilities 
intact. In Thailand’s case, goods whose prices have increased or decreased 
as much 10% are excluded as this achieves 3 desirable characteristics for 
the indicator: (1) low volatility; (2) unbiased; and (3) has good predictive 
power for the inflation outlook.
(4)Sticky PriceCPIis an underlying inflation indicator that is calculated
from goods and services whose prices change infrequently ( i.e.prices are 
sticky). This is done by removing from the CPI basket goods and services 
whose prices change more often than average frequency (average frequency
of price changes for all 445 goods and services in Thailand is once every 
4.8 months (Apaitan et a. (2020)). The construction of the Stick Price CPI is 
based on the study by Bryan and Meyer (2010 ). Box 3: Underlying inflation indicators for Thailand
(5)Principal Component CPIis an underlying inflation indicator 
constructed using principal component analysis. The correlations between 
prices of goods and services across 28 sub -categories form the principal 
component. This principal component reflects broad -based price changes 
across most goods and services and is not affected by temporary shocks 
arising from supply -side factors or sector -specific shocks. 
(6) Common Component CPIis an underlying inflation indicator 
constructed using the generalized dynamic factor model based on the 
methodology used by Forni et al. (2020). Prices of all goods and services in 
the CPI basket are divided into 66 sub -categories and then t he common 
factor that drives price changes for all 66 sub -categories in the same 
direction is extracted. This common factor reflects inflation in a broad -
based manner as it separates inflation driven by the common factor from 
inflation driven by idiosyncratic factors.  
The key benefits of Principal Component CPI and Common Component
CPI are that they use price data of all goods and services within the CPI 
basket without any exclusions, thus fully utilizing all the explanatory 
power offered by available price data. Monetary Policy Decision

inflation outlook as each underlying inflation indicator has its pros 
and cons, and offers different information. Monitoring many indicators 
also provides checks and balances, and thus more confidence in the 
assessment of the inflation outlook. Latest inflation data from May 2022 
showed an increase in many underlying inflation indicators for 
Thailand. For instance, the Sticky Price CPI, Symmetric trimmed mean CPI, 
and Core CPI (excluding rent & measures) have increased by more than 0.5 
percentage point from the midpoint of the target range. Meanwhile, Core 
CPI is also close to the levels seen during previous episodes of high 
inflation. These indicators reflect that prices of goods and services are on 
the rise and thus inflation developments must be monitored closely in 
conducting monetary policy going forward. Underlying inflation indicators (%YoY)Jan 22 Feb 22 Mar 22 Apr 22 May 22

61/72Anchoring inflation expectations :Core inflation has edged up closer to levels seen during past episodes of high inflation . Monetary policy 
should respond in a timely manner to keep inflation expectations well -anchored and prevent anticipations of an inflation regime change. Economic growth Inflation Financial stability
•Core inflation exceeded 2% as with previous episodes of high 
inflation in 2005, 2008, and 2011.
•Changes in the public’s view on inflation (inflation psychology)
might lead to persistently high core inflation, such as through 
higher pricing or negotiations for higher wages based on recent 
inflation outturns. The pass -through of higher energy costs to 
consumer prices which is an indirect effect of rising costs.
•Monetary policy should respond in a timely manner and adapt 
to the changing growth and inflation outlook. This is to prevent
the public’s expectations of persistently rising inflation (regime 
change). The appropriate course of monetary policy actions woul d 
foster confidence among the general public and keep medium -term
inflation expectations well -anchored within the target range. -6-4-20246810

62/72The NPL ratio of total household credit is largely stable at below 3% of total debt, with improvements seen in many loan types due to 
credit risk management on part of the financial institutions as well as debt assistance measures. However, the NPL ratio of other consumer 
loans is still on the rise. As such, it is still necessary to monitor debt serviceability especially of households whose e income is still recovering 
slowly. The NPL ratio of total business credit declined slightly partly due to the debt restructuring and debt assistance measures. Credit quality: Credit quality of household credit is largely unchanged 
while the credit quality of corporate loans saw slight improvements. Economic growth Inflation Financial stability

63/72The financial health of l ow-income households is highly vulnerable. More than two -thirds of low -income households with debt have 
insufficient net income to service their debt (chart on the left) and insufficient income for consumption spending as reflected in their C/Y ratio 
of more than 100%. They are also heavily indebted as reflected in their debt service ratio of 24% which is higher than other income groups 
(chart on the right). Debt serviceability of households:
remains a risk that needs to be monitored, especially among low-income households. There is a need to continue 
implementing debt restructuring measures as well as measures targeted at the vulnerable groups. Economic growth Inflation Financial stability
