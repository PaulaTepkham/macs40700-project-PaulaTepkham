The Monetary Policy Report  is prepared quarterly by staff of the 
Bank of Thailand with the approval of the Monetary Policy Committee 
(MPC).  It serves two purposes: ( 1) to communicate to the public the  
MPC’s  consideration and rationales for the conduct of monetary policy, 
and (2)  to present the latest set of  economic and inflation forecast s, based 
on which  the monetary policy decisions  were made .

Monetary Policy in Thailand  
The Monetary Policy Committee  
Under the Bank of Thailand Act, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) comprise of the 
Governor and two deputy Governors, as well as four distinguished external members  
representing various sectors of the country, with the aim to provide monetary policy decisions 
that are effective and transparent.  
 
The Monetary Policy Objective  
The MPC sets monetary policy with the objective to suppor t sustainable a nd full potential 
economic growth, without causing inflationary problems or economic and financial imbalances 
or bubbles.  
 
The Monetary Policy Target  
The National Council for Peace and Order approved the use of quarterly  average core 
inflation with the range of 0.5 -3.0 percent  per annum , which was jointly proposed by the MPC 
and the Minister of Finance, as monetary policy target for 2015. In an event that core inflation 
deviates from the target, the MPC shall explain the reasons behind target breach  to the 
public, together with action plans to bring inflation back to the target.  
 
The Monetary Policy Instrument  
The MPC utilizes the 1 -day bilateral repurchase transaction rate as the policy rate  to signal 
the monetary policy stance.  
 
Evaluating economic conditions and forecasts  
The Bank of Thailand considers information from all sources, the macroeconomic model, data 
in each economic sector, as well as direct opinions from large enterprises and small and 
medium -sized  enterprises from all over the country,  and various financial institutions to ensure 
that economic evaluations and forecasts are accurate and covers all aspects, both in the 
macro and micro levels.   
 
Monetary Policy Communication  
Recognizing the importance of Monetary Policy communication to the public, the MPC 
arrange many forms of communication, both in Thai and English, such as (1) organizing a 
press statement at 14.00 hrs. on the day of the meeting, (2) publishing edited  Minutes of the 
MPC meeting two weeks after the meeting, and (3) publishing the Monetary Policy Report  
every quarter.  Monetary Policy Report  September  2014

1.1 Growth and inflation prospec ts 
In 2014, the Thai economy was likely to 
expand  close to the previous projection. Growth in 
2015, however, would be lower than previously 
projected. Inflationary pressure edged down in line 
with global oil price s and the government’s plan to 
restructure domestic oil  prices.  
The economy recovered continually  
after the political change.  The public sector 
resumed normal operation and expedited  budget 
disbursement to stimulate growth and shore up 
private confidence. As a result, private spending 
increased particularly private consumption. 
However, sentiment of foreign tourists that 
improved rather slowly continued to weigh on the 
tourism sector . Export  growth was  subdued owing The Thai economy recovered continually  and g rowth in 2014 was 
expected to be close to the previous projection. The increase in domestic 
spending after the political tension was resolved helped offset the weakening 
momentum from 1)  production constraints in the export sector , and  
2) the slow rebound of tourism that was affected by the political situation.  
However, exports that  slowed down  significantly  would cause growth in 2015 to 
be weaker than previously projected. Meanwhile, inflationary pressure edged 
down due to the decline in global oil price s and the government’s plan to 
restructure domestic oil prices.  
In the past two meetings, the MPC voted to hold the policy rate at 2.00 
percent per annum to support economic recovery during reform periods without 
affecting economic and financial stability.

manufacturing sector .  
The MPC assessed that the overall 
economy would continue to recover in 2015 
albeit at a slower pace than previously 
projected . The downward revision  of growth 
stemmed from 1) production constraints in 
merchandise exports which would take time to 
resolve and 2)  the slow rebound in exports of 
services. Additionally, given that momentum  from 
domestic spending was projected to be sub -par, 
the MPC deemed government stimulus to be 
inadequate to completely offset the weakening 
economic thrust. (Chart 1.1 and Table 1.1)  
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Risks that the Thai economy would 
deviate from the previous assessment, 
especially in 2014, stemmed from production 
constraints  which could negatively affect 
exports , and lower -than -expected trading 
partners’ economic growth owing to possible 
heightening of geopolitical risk between 
Russia and Ukraine.  Moreover, th e domestic 
political situation could continue to undermine  
foreign tourists’ confidence, posing a drag on 
recovery of Thailand’s  tourism  sector . Public  
spending could also be delayed due to restrictions

gover nment. Nevertheless, the MPC judged risk 
from public  spending to gradually ease as policies 
gained greater clarity.  
Meanwhile, upside risks to economic growth  
could stem from higher -than-expected trading 
partners’ economic growth due to additional  
monet ary stimulus in major economies. The 
possible lifting of martial law in 2015 could also 
help tourism to rebound faster than expected. 
Furthermore, expedition  of budget disbursement 
and higher -than-expected additional government 
stimulus , along with faster -than-expected recovery 
of private investment following  improved confidence  
which owed  to greater policy clarity, could 
potential ly drive growth above the baseline 
projection.  
On the whole, the MPC viewed that the 
probability of the economy expanding lower  
than projected was greater than the probability 
of the economy expanding beyond the 
baseline case in 2014 . The fan chart for growth 
was, therefore, skewed downwards at the 
beginning of the projection period. In 2015, 
however, the downside risk from public  
spending was expected to reduce while the 
upside risk from tourism  was expected to 
increase. The fan chart for growth thus 
became balanced towards the end of the 
projection period.  (Chart 1.2)   
Inflation projections for both headline 
and core inflation edged down  in line with the 
decrease in global oil price s and the government’s 
plan to restructure domestic oil prices. Meanwhile, 
the pass -through of household LPG price which 
was consistently increased since the end of last 
year, eased gradually as expec ted. Looking

line with oil price s while demand -pulled pressure 
was expected to edge higher  towards the end of 
2014 during the economic recovery and the 
closing of output gap in 2015. (Table 1.1)  
Moreover, the MPC  assessed that  risks to both 
headline and core inflation were relatively 
balanced. In this regard, upside risks to inflation 
could stem from higher -than-expected pass -
through during economic recovery and LPG price 
hikes . Downside risks to inflation include d weaker -
than-expected demand -pulled  pressure that could 
result should economic growth deviate  from the 
baseline projection. (Charts 1.3 and 1.4)   
1.2 Economic outlook  
The economy was poised to recover 
continually after the political change. Growth 
outlook for 2014 remained close to the previous 
projection due to domestic demand momentum, 
particularly public  spending and private consumption  
which improved after the publi c sector resumed 
normal operation and private sentiment was 
restored. Meanwhile, exports of goods and 
services which  were poised to recover  slowly  
would weaken the pace of economic growth in 
2015.  
Domestic demand was poised to recover 
continually but growth of exports of goods and 
services would be lower than the previous 
projection . 
 In 2014, the Thai economy was likely  to 
expand close to the previous projection  as the 
thrust from public  spending and private 
consumption would help offset the sluggish Monetary Policy Report  September 2014                 5 recovery in exports of goods and services.  
After the political situation gained much clarity 
since mid -year, expedition  of budget disbursement 
helped shore up private confidence and  result ed in 
higher  consumption of non -durables. Meanwhile, 
investment expanded somewhat in line with 
investment in construction and projects with Board 
of Investment (BOI) approval and permit for 
factory operation (Ror.Ngor. 4), although some 
businesses still chose to wait in order to reassess 
future economic prospects . 
 The thrust gained from domestic 
spending  was expected to help offset the 
weakening economic momentum  that stemmed 
from (1) the sluggish recovery and low growth of 
merchandise  exports due to production techno logy 
constraints which  greatly restricted Thailand’s 
competitiveness, disease outbreak in shrimps, and 
the slump in farm prices; and (2) the slow rebound 
in tourism as improvement in foreign tourists’ 
sentiment remained slow due in part to the 
ongoing declaration of  martial law which led many 
coun tries to maintain travel advisories . 
 Going forward, the economy in 2014 was 
poised to expand slowly in line with domestic 
demand. Nonetheless, the momentum from 
exports of goods and services was expected to 
weake n due to production technology constraints 
which restricted the manufacturing sector in 
respond ing to changes in market demand along 
with over -reliance on agricultural products.  Both 
these problems would take time to resolve. 
Moreover, recovery in tourism was assessed to be 
slow. These weaknesses coupled with consumption  
of durable s which remained sub -par due to the 
elevated household debt, implied that the 
economic growth in 2015 would be lower than  
previously projected . (Chart 1.5 and Table 1.2 )

The global economy should recover  steadily  
The global economy recovered steadily , 
particularly the U.S.  economy,  albeit at a slightly 
slower pace than previously projected owing to  
slower -than-expected recover ies in the euro and 
Japanese economies . 
Thailand’s trading partner economies 
were assessed to recover steadily albeit at a 
slightly slower pace than previously projected  
(Chart 1.6) . The downward revision in growth 
stemmed from geopolitical risk in the euro area 
which farther dented recovery prospect of already 
weak economic fundamentals , and sluggish 
recovery in Japan due to negative impact s of the 
consumption tax hike. Nonetheless, the U.S. 
economy continued to grow steadily while Asian 
economies recovered in line with their export 
sectors.  
The U.S. economy was expected to pick 
up continually  (Chart 1.7 ) after decelerating 
slightly  at the beginning of the year due to the 
temporary effect of unusually cold weather.

in households’ financial conditions in line wit h 
rising house prices, recovery in employment,  
and the ongoing accommodative monetary policy. 
However, the continuity of U.S. economic recovery, 
particularly the real estate sector, remained subject 
to risk of some tightening  in monetary conditions , 
following the Fed’s unwinding of its Quantitative 
Easing (QE) measures.  
In this regard, the firming up of U.S. 
economic recovery prompted the Fed to gradually 
reduce its asset purchases to 15 billion U.S. 
dollars per  month in September and signal  its 
intention t o hold the fed funds rate at 0 -0.25 
percent per annum for some time to retain 
continuous economic momentum. Accordingly,  
the MPC assessed that the Fed would keep the 
fed funds rate at this level until mid -2015 before 
raising it in 2015 Q3, one quarter earl ier than  
its previous projection  (as per  Monetary Policy 
Report  June 2014 ). 
Euro area economies  were  poised to 
grow at a slower pace than previously projected  
due to ongoing structural problems and the impact 
of geopolitical risk on already weak economic 
fundamentals. (Chart 1.8)  The EU’s  decision to 
boycott Russia  and Russia’s subsequent retaliation  
actions on western economies caused  business 
sentiment  to deteriorate continually , resulting in  
the greater -than-expected slowdown in in vestment.  
Furthermore, an important risk to growth of the 
euro area would come from structural reforms, 
especially in periphery economies1/, which must 
be pushed forward  although the effort could 
potentially hinder economic expansion . Meanwhile,

was assessed to help improve confidence to some 
exten t. 
The Japanese economy was likely to 
expand at a slower pace than previously 
projected  (Chart 1.9 ) due to a  greater -than-
expected contraction in domestic demand in 2014 
Q2, following the consumption tax hike in April. 
Nonetheless, it was expected that recovery would 
proceed  gradually  in the second half of the year  in 
line with the previous projection and a numbe r of 
supporting factors , namely  the expedition  of 
government budget disbursement  to provide extra 
stimulus and the  pick-up in exports in line with 
recoveries  in trading partners’ economies, 
particularly  the U.S. economy. T hese factors were 
expected to help  Japan’s domestic demand and 
manufacturing sector pick up steadily.  
Looking ahead, risks to the Japanese 
economy included  the less-than-expected effect of 
economic stimulus. Moreover, uncertainty on the 
second roun d consumption tax hike from 8 to 10 
perce nt which was scheduled in December 2014  
and to be enforced in October 2015, remained a 
factor to keep abreast. In addition, should 
geopolitical risk in the euro area heighten, the yen 
could depreciate by less than expected as 
investors would continue to use it as a safe haven

Longer -Term Refinancing  Operations (TLTROs)  were 
announced. Then, in the September 2014 meeting, the 
ECB announced an across -the-board interest rate cut by 
0.1 percent per annum, causing the refinancing rate, the 
ECB marginal lending rate and the ECB  deposit rate to 
reduce to 0.05, 0.3 and -0.2 percent per annum, 
respectiv ely. Additional quantitative easing measures 
were also announced, including the Asset -Backed  
Securities  Purchase  Program and the Covered  Bonds  
Purchase Program.

accommodative monetary poli cy stance3  for some 
time.  
The Chinese economy was poised to 
expand close to the previous projection.  (Chart 
1.10)  Exports would likely pick up continually in 
line with the global economic recovery that was 
led by the U.S. economy. Meanwhile, investment 
which used to  be an important growth engine in 
the past would slow down in part  as a result of 
China’s policy to rebalance its economic structure 
by reducing reliance on investment especially in 
industries with overcapacity and in the real estate 
sector wh ere imbalances between demand and 
supply were noted in many provinces.   
The Chinese government continued to 
focus effort on economic reforms by replacing 
investment with domestic consumption as the 
growth engine. This resulted  in some  economic 
slowdown in  the short -term; nevertheless,  it was 
assessed that the Chinese economy in 2014 
would be able to grow close to the target of 7.5 
percent  The projection owed to the government’s 
gradual introduction of policies  to support reform -
affected sectors . Example  included the approval 
for real estate developers to borrow from the 
interbank market, which was designed to provide 
access to necessary funding for  large and 
profitable corporates that were affected by 
measures to curb shadow banking . Another 
example  was the expedition of investment in

Asian economies (excluding Japan and 
China) were likely to expand close to the 
previous projections  (Chart 1.11) , driven mainly 
by the gradual recovery in exports, especially 
electronics, that would help offset the weakening 
domestic demand momentum. The latter stemmed 
from ( ) financial institutions’ tightening of credit 
standards especially for real estate investment; 
and (2) limitations on consumption growth which 
owed to the elevated household debt in many 
countr ies, for example, Hong Kong, South Korea, 
Malaysia and Singapore.   
Thai exports recovered only slowly  
Notwithstanding the steady pick up in the 
global economy, Thai exports of goods and 
services were likely to recover slower than 
previously projected.  
In 2014, merchandise  exports were 
likely to recover slower and expand  by 
significantly lower than the  previous 
projections due mainly to  the greater -than -
expected negative impact of production 
constraints and low export prices.  (Table 1.3)  
Export volume picked up significantly slower than 
previously projected in part due to lower -than-
expected demand from trading partner economies, 
particularly the euro and Japanese economies. 
Moreover, the export sector  was faced with long -
term structural problems namely (1)  the long 
absence  of investment in production technology 
especially for electronics goods such as integrated 
circuits, which hindered Thailand’s global 
competitiveness; (2) over -reliance on agricultural 
products during times of low farm prices,

supply problem. Thus, export s of agricultural 
products were  unable to fully benefit from global 
economic recovery; and (3) the downward trend in 
growth of automobile exports as trading partner 
economies such as Indonesia were able to 
replace imports with domestic production as well 
as compete with Thai exports in the global m arket.  
Nonetheless, exports of certain goods  
were able to recover steadily, for example, 
petrochemical pr oduct s, machinery  and equipment , 
processed agricultural produc ts, and parts and 
accessories for motor vehicles . Looking ahead, 
once the manufacturing sector w as able to resolve 
current production constraints, Thailand would 
benefit from  the global economic recovery to a 
greater extent. This positive development would 
support the manufacturing sector, household 
income, and strengthen private confidence , 
leading to further investment to expand production 
capacity. However, the role of merchandise 
exports as an engine of growth would decline 
and production capacity would be lower than 
previously projected in the short -term given 
that the aforementioned structural p roblems 
would take time to address and resolve.  
Exports of services were poised to 
decline owing to the sluggish recovery in 
tourist income relative to the previous 
projection.  Tourist income in 2014 was assessed 
to decline continually due to the negative impact of 
the political situation which put a de nt in tourism 
climate. Despite the  speedy rebound in the 
number of East Asian tourists after the political 
tension subsided thanks to their quick decisions 
regarding travel plan s, that of European tourists 
was slow to respond in part due to the slowdown 
in their economies. The ongoing martial law  12    Monetary Policy Report  September 2014   declaration  also had an implication on travel 
insurance policies, thereby affecting confidence of 
European tourists who normally took time to make 
travel plans. There fore, the tourism sector was 
assessed to grow by less than previously 
projected in 2015.  
 The current account balance4/ was 
expected to record a surplus in 2014 but would 
be close to balance in 2015.  (Table 1.3)  The 
current account was likely to record a large 
surplus after a deficit was registered in 2013, 
mainly due to low imports during the first half of 
the year in line with the slowdown in domestic 
demand. Nonetheless, it was expected that in 
2015, the curre nt account would be close to 
balance following the increase in imports of 
consumer goods, raw materials, intermediate 
goods, capital goods and machineries , in line with 
the gradual pick up in domestic demand.

for economic growth  going forward  
The fiscal stimulus continued to play  its 
role. The  delays in 2014 public  spending would  
translate to the higher fiscal stimulus in 2015 .  
Fiscal stimulus would assume a key 
role in sustaining economic growth.  (Chart 
1.12)  Public  spending was expected to provide a 
key thrust for economic growth during the latter 
half of 2014. After the political change in mid -year, 
the public sector was able to resume normal 
operation, resulting in more concrete policies and 
higher budget disburse ment compared to the first 
half of the year. Some portions of public  spending, 
however, were delayed due to project examination 
for transparency issues. In fiscal year 2015, fiscal 
stimulus was expected to persist and would be 
slightly higher than previous ly projected thanks  to 
the promulgation of the Budget Act  following the 
government formation, budget disbursement 
acceleration measure s for approved projects ,  
and the postponement of spending on some 
investment pr ojects to 2015, including investment 
in inf rastructur e.  
Compared to the previous projection, 
assumptions on public spending were adjusted  
slightly downward s in 201 4 but upward s in 
2015.  (Table  1.4) Delays in public spending in 
fiscal year 2014 prompted the MPC to anticipate 
that disbursement rate would decline to 91.4 
percent from the previous assumption.  Nonetheless,  
the MPC viewed that public spending would 
slightly increase in fiscal year  2015,  with 
disbursement rate of 93.7 percent in line with the 
measures  to accelerate budget disbursement  
since the beginning of the fiscal year as well as 
state enterprises’ expenditure that  was expected

Private spending recovered steadily  
Greater political clarity would help shore 
up spending confidence of the private sector, 
particularly private consumption. Meanwhile, 
private investment was expected to remain close 
to the previous projection.  
Private consumption was poised to grow 
at a higher rat e than  previously projected.  
Consumption of non -durable s and services picked 
up since mid -2014 due to several reasons , for 
instance, the rapid turnaround in confidence  and 
the government’ s policies  to maintain people’s 
purchasing power . These policies include d, the 
expedition of debt repayment to farmers in the rice 
pledging scheme, the reduction of domestic oil 
price, and the request for businesses’ cooperation 
in maintaining prices , etc. Other reasons included 
greater  political clarity  and signs of recovery  of 
consumption of durable s. 
The MPC assessed that private 
consumption was likely to pick up steadily but 
it would remain sub -par due to spending 
constraints  from the elevated household debt and 
low farm income , which followed global farm 
prices.   However, it was expected that spending

its normal trend in the latter half of 2015 thanks to 
improvements in employmen t and non -farm 
income in line with the economic rec overy.  
Private investment was expected to 
recover gradually and expand close to the 
previous projection.  The political situation which 
unwound in mid -year coupled with greater policy 
clarity helped rebuild confidence and led 
businesses to invest, especiall y in construction 
projects to support the government’s investment  
in infrastructures. Investment in machinery and 
equipment remained somewhat subdued at this 
early stage  since  most of it was for repair and 
replacement . Business  operators  still preferred  
to wait to reassess future  economic prospects .  
In addition,  investment to expand production 
capacity  in export -oriented industries was 
postponed  due to the soft patch in merchandise 
exports. However, the MPC assessed that private 
investment would substantiate towards the end of 
2014. An increase in investment in m achinery and 
equipment to expand production capacity was 
anticipated given BOI’s investment promotion 
approvals for a number of projects that had been 
postponed previously. It was also expected that 
investment in export -oriented manu facturing sectors  
would  pick up towards the end of 2015.  
Looking ahead, the MPC deemed many of 
Thailand’s supply restrictions to persist, for 
instance, production technology which could not 
promptly respond to changes in the global market, 
labor shortage and skill mismatch, and high 
transportation cost. These structural limitations 
would not only affect Thailand’s competitiveness 
in the current period but also investment decision 
and the country’s economic potential in future 
periods. Therefore, successful implementation of 16    Monetary Policy Report  September 2014   manuf acturing production restructuring and planned  
infrastructure development by the government 
coupled with cooperation from the private sector  
to resolve these issues would help maintain 
Thailand’s ability to grow sustainably  
Inflationary pressure was likely  to be lower 
than previous projections  
 Inflationary pressure edged lower than 
expected in tandem with the decline in global oil 
price s and the government’s plan to restructure 
domestic oil prices . 
Headline and core inflation was po ised 
to soften in line with the decline in global oil 
price s and the government’s plan to restructure 
domestic retail oil  prices . Meanwhile,  the pass -
through of household LPG price which was raised 
since the end of 2013 gradually dissipate as 
expected. Going forward, it was asse ssed  that 
demand -pulled pressure would remain close to the 
previous projection.  
Inflationary pressure from the demand 
side was likely to be close to the previous 
projection.  Although the economic growth in 2015 
would be softer than previously projected, t he 
reduction in potential output in the short -term 
implied that demand -pulled pressure (as reflected 
by the output gap) would remain similar to the 
previous projection. The reduction in the potential 
output stemmed from production constraints in the 
export  sector.  In sum,  a highly negative output gap 
would be recorded during the first half of 2014 in 
line with sluggish domestic spending and exports. 
Then, towards the second half of the year, the 
output gap would start to improve and eventually 
be closed in 2015 mainly in tandem with  
improvement in domestic spending.  (Chart 1.13)

from the previous proje ction following the 
decrease in world  oil and commodity prices.  
Baseline Dubai crude oil price  (Chart 1.14)  in 
2014 was revised down from the previous 
assessment to 103.5 U.S. dollars per barrel before 
stabilizing at 101.0 U.S. dollars per barrel 
throughout 2015. The revision was prompted by 
the easing of concerns over geopolitical risk in oil 
produ cing countri es such as Iraq since the 
problem did not affect the level of output. At the 
same time, there was an increase in the global 
supply of oil from OPEC countries and the U.S. 
Meanwhile, global demand for oil did not reach the 
level previously anticipated. The aforementioned 
excess production capacity, therefore, led the 
MPC to assess that global oil price s would remain 
low in the periods ahead . 
Moreover, the government’s policy to 
control domestic energy prices continued to 
affect cost pressure.  In this regard, the MPC 
revised the assumptions of domestic retail oil 
prices slightly downward s from the previous 
assessments in line with the price restructuring 
plan. However, the MPC maintained  assumptions 
on the maintenance of LPG price s for househol ds 
and the transportation sector along with  excise tax 
exemption for diesel oil. These government 
measures were likely to cause cost pressure from 
energy prices to remain subdued continually . 
Meanwhile, world non -fuel commodity 
prices declined from the previous projections in 
almost all categories. (Chart 1.15)  Food prices, in 
particular, were expected to decrease owing to the 
increase in global supply of cereals while stock 
remained high. On the other hand, metal prices 
increased margi nally, due to an improvement in 
demand from the U.S. and a decline  in supply

ahead, it was expected that metal prices wo uld 
rise steadily in line with a higher demand  that 
stemmed from  global economic recovery . Prices 
of raw materials such as rubber and cotton would 
also increase slightly. On the whole, however, 
world non -fuel commodity prices were likely to 
remain low in 2015 in line with  food prices where 
the problem of excess supply persisted . 
Domestic fresh food prices  (Chart 1.16)  
edged higher mainly in tandem with rice price 
which increased in line with higher -than-expected 
foreign demand. Nonetheless, prices of other food 
products in 2014 were likely to remain close to the 
previous projections. Prices of s hrimp and swine 
were expected to trend downwards after the 
disease outbreaks gradually subsided. Thus, the 
MPC assessed that agricultural prices in 2015 
would edge lower from this year.  
Looking ahead, the MPC judged that 
risks to inflation would be balance d. Risks that 
could cause inflation to be higher than baseline  
case  would be matched by risks that could cause 
inflation to be lower than baseline  case . The 
former stemmed from the higher -than-expected 
pass -through during the econo mic recovery and 
LPG pric e hike. The latter  stemmed from the 
lower -than-expected demand -pulled pressure  should  
growth dip below the baseline.   
Alternat ive Scenarios  
The MPC  appraised that there were 
various scenarios where Thai economic growth 
could deviate from the baseline case. The MPC 
thus took these scenarios into consideration to 
reflect key risk factors on the Thai economy and 
inflationary pressure, going forward.

Sep 14 (baseline ) assumptionsMonetary Policy Report  September 2014                 19 Scenario  1: Thai ex ports grew at a lower 
rate due to slower -than -expected recoveries  
in trading partner economies as a result of 
geopolitical risk, greater -than -expected impact 
from domestic production constraints, and 
slower -than-expected recovery in tourism due  
to the poli tical situation.  These factors would 
hamper production in export -oriented industries, 
thereby affecting employment, income and 
confidence of  households and businesses. 
Households would thus become more cautious  
in their spending while businesses would likely 
postpone investment to expand production 
capacity. In this scenario, growth would be lower 
than the baseline case and inflationary pressure 
would decline.  
Scenario 2: Public spending was lower 
than assessed  due to delays in project 
implementation and purchasing and acquisition 
process.  The delays would affect household and 
business confidence, resulting in a greater -than-
expected decline in domestic spending compared 
to the previous projec tion. In this scenario, growth 
would be lower than the baseline case and 
inflationary pressure from the demand side would 
decline.  
Scenario 3: Private investment rebounded  
quicker than expected from improvement in 
confidence following greater clarity on  public  
policies.  Recovery in investment would support 
employment and increase household income, 
resulting in higher private spending. In this 
scenario, growth would be higher than the 
baseline case and inflationary pressure would 
increase in the short -term. Potential output would 
also be raised in tandem with private investment  
and public investment in infrastructure development  
projects.  20    Monetary Policy Report  September 2014   1.3 Monetary policy decision   
 Monetary policy remained accommodative  
 In the past two meetings, the MPC voted 
to hold the policy rate at 2.00 percent per annum. 
The MPC deemed that the current accommodative 
monetary policy stance remained appropriately 
supportive of the economic recovery and 
implementation of structural reforms to uplift 
Thailand’s economic potential . 
In its meeting on August 6, 2014, the MPC 
assessed that the global economy would continue 
to recover gradually, especially the U.S. economy 
which firmed up noticeabl y. On the other hand, 
recoveries  in the euro area and Japanese 
economies remained sluggi sh and required further 
monetary policy accommodation. The Chinese 
and Asian economies expanded steadily thanks  
to export momentum which benefited from 
recoveries of major economies. Meanwhile, the 
Thai economy in 2014 Q2 improved thanks to 
private spendin g after the political situation 
unwound . Merchandise exports recovered slowly 
and there were some delays in budget 
disbursement. In the latter half of the year, the 
economic recovery was expected to continue  
in line with domestic demand and the gradual 
increase in fiscal stimulus, especially public 
investment. Meanwhile, merchandise exports and 
tourism were likely to grow slowly. Nonetheless, 
price stability would be well maintained. The MPC 
assessed that the currently accommodative 
monetary policy stance w ould be necessary to 
facilitate economic recovery without affecting 
overall economic and financial stability, which 
would be supportive of the government’s reform 
efforts to uplift Thailand’s economic potential   Monetary Policy Report  September 2014                 21 The Committee  thus voted unanimously to main tain 
the policy rate at 2.00 percent per annum . 
In its subsequent meeting on September 
17, 2014, the MPC assessed that the global 
economy recovered slightly slower than expected 
with uneven paces of recoveries between regions. 
In particular, the euro area and Japanese 
economies remained fragile but would likely gain 
support from continual economic stimulus. Asian 
economies overall  expanded close to the previous 
projections. For Thailand, recent economic indicators  
signaled improvement in spending of househo lds, 
businesses and the public sector, following the 
rebound in confidence. The increase in spending 
would allow the economy to grow continually in  
the periods ahead. However, production constraints  
and the problem of low agricultural prices would 
hamper t he prospect of merchandise exports while 
the tourism  sector  would improve slowly at first 
before returning to its normal trend. Meanwhile, 
financial stability and price stability continued to be 
well maintained. The MPC assessed that the 
currently accommod ative monetary policy stance 
would be necessary to facilitate economic 
recovery without affecting financial stability. The 
Committee thus voted unanimously to maintain 
the policy rate at 2.00 percent per annum . Two 
members were absent from this meeting.

Meanwhile, Asian economies stabilized and euro

The U.S. economy recovered significantly 
despite some impact from severe weather 
conditions during the first quarter as fundamentals 
continued to pick up. 
In 2014 Q2, the U.S. economy  rebounded 
and grew by 4.2 percent (qoq saar, second 
estimate). The r ecovery became more broad -
based as improvements were noted in private 
consumption and investment, exports and 
inventory accumulation. This development was a 
turnaround from the previous quarter where a  The global economy recovered steadily, led by the U.S. economy which 
firmed up significantly from continued  improvement in fundamentals. Euro area 
economies slowed down in tandem with domestic demand and exports which 
owed to structural problems that needed time to resolve. Meanwhile, geopolitical 
risk began to affect the region more noticeably. The Japanese eco nomy picked 
up gradually after the consumption tax hike. Asian economies and China 
stabilized as steady improvement in exports helped offset a softening in domestic 
demand.  
 In 2014 Q2, the Thai economy expanded from last quarter and the same 
period last year, following improvements in private consumption and public 
expenditures  after the political situation unwound. Meanwhile, investment 
continued to contract. However, recovery in merchandise exports remained slow 
and firms continued to discharge their hi gh levels of inventories. A contraction in 
manufacturing activities was  thus recorded overall .

the impact of unusually cold weather. (Chart 2.1)  
The outlook for 2014 Q3 remained bright 
as reflected by key leading  indicators in July  
and August which continue d to signal overall 
expansion. For example, the  manufacturing 
Purchasing Manager ’s Index (PMI) increased 
favorably in tandem with the Manufacturing 
Production Index despite some recent slowdown 
in real estate activities after  the strong 
acceleration in previous periods which in part 
owed to an increase in lending rates and 
unusually cold weather at the beginning of the 
year. Nonetheless, it was assessed that the U.S. 
economy was likely to continue expanding due to 
improvements in the labor market, b usiness and 
consumer confidence and  households’ financing 
conditions thanks to  higher  asset price s, along 
with the continually accommodative monetary 
policy stance1/.  
Euro area economies  recovered gradually. 
Though consumption in major e conomies grew 
steadily thanks to favorable economic fundamentals,  
geopolitical risk and structural problems in 
periphery countries continued to weigh on growth.  
In 2014 Q2, euro area  economies 
stabilized from the previous quarter with private 
consumption and exports as main engines of 
growth. Meanwhile, private investment slowed 
                                                        
1/ In the meetings on September 16 -17, 2014, the FOMC 
decided to (1) hold the fed funds rate at 0 -0.25 percent 
per annum and signal that the rate would be maintained 
for some time (forward guidance)  even after unemployment  
and inflation moved closer to target s; (2) reduce its asset 
purchase by 10 billion U.S. dollars to  stand at  15 billion 
U.S. dollars per month. The amount would comprise 10 
billion U.S. dollars of long -term government bonds and  
5 billion U.S. dollars of Agency  Mortgage -Backed  Securities . Monetary Policy Report  September 2014                  27 down markedly, particularly in construction after  
a strong acceleration was noted in the previous 
quarter d ue to warmer -than-normal temperature. 
This factor coupled with the high number of public 
holidays in May 20142/ led manufacturing activities 
to slow down. Moreover, economic conditions 
were negatively impacted by the geopolitical 
tension  between Russia and Ukraine.   
The outlook for 2014 Q3 was poised to 
slow down  owing to rising tension after the EU 
announced additional boycotts on Russia3/ and  
the latter  subsequently implemented retaliation 
measures against western countries through a 
ban on food imports. The softening outlook was 
reflected by a number of co nfidence indicators 
namely the Consumer Confidence I ndex, the 
European Commission Sentiment Index and the 
Composite Output PMI. (Chart 2.2)  
Looking ahead, it was assessed that euro 
area economies were li kely to expand gradually, 
supported mainly by domestic spending especially 
in Germany whe re fundamentals remained strong . 
Nonetheless, some slowdown s in exports to 
Russia , investment and manufacturing output  
were to be noted  due to rising geopolitical tens ion. 
Moreover, the unwinding of  fiscal stimulus and 
lingering structural problems in periphery countries 
which continued to demand attention would pose 
                                                        
2/ Including Labor Day, Victory Day and Ascension Day. 
Since these public holidays fell on Thursday s, some 
workers decided to take Friday s off to enjoy long 
weekend s. 
3/ On July 29, 2014, the EU announced a ban for entry into 
the EU for 95 individuals and 23 c orporates along with 
boycott measures in three areas namely arms and 
related material, certain energy -related equipment and 
technology, and new bonds, equity or similar financial 
instruments

However, the ECB’s announcement of the 
Targeted Long -term Refinancing Operations 
(TLTROs)4/ which would begin in September  was 
expected to help stimulate credit to some extent. 
In addition, the weakening euro which resulted 
from a reduction in interest rates and additional 
quantitative easing announced in September5/ 
would help boost the region’s exports somewhat.  
In 2014 Q3, the Japanese e conomy picked 
up slowly after the significant contraction in the 
previous quarter in line with recoveries in private 
consumption and investment following  the 
consumption tax hike . 
In 2014 Q2, the Japanese economy  
contracted by 1.8 percent (qoq sa) (Chart 2.3)  due 
to significant contractions in private consumption 
and investment following the consumption tax 
hike. Meanwhile, exports contracted in tandem 
with a slowdown in trading partner economies, 
particularly Asian countries. Nonetheless, the 
concurrent reduc tion of imports helped the overall 
external sector achieve positive contribution to 
growth. Moreover, a significant contraction was  
                                                        
4/ TLTROs is  a credit stimulus measure under which the 
ECB lends to financial institutions at an interest rate of 
policy interes t + 0.15 percent per annum for a duration of  
four years. The objective of TLTROs is to resolve 
monetary policy transmission issues and mitigate the risk 
of prolonged low inflation.  
5/  In the meeting on September 4, 2014, the Governing 
Council voted to (1) reduce interest rates across -the-
board by 0.1 percent per annum, causing the refinancing 
rate, the ECB marginal lending rate and the EC B deposit 
rate to decline to 0.05, 0.2 and -0.2 percent per annum, 
respectively; and (2) implement additional quantitative 
easing measures by announcing the Asset -Backed

contractions in both domestic and external 
demand  
The outlook for 2014 Q3  was likely to 
improve gradually. Despite temporary negative 
impact from the typhoon which caused retail sales 
to contract in July, private consumption was set to 
improve moderately  after the consumption tax hike 
as reflected by consumer confidence in July  which 
came in higher than last quarter’s average. 
Meanwhile, exports began to improve  in line with 
the outlook of major trading partner economies 
especially the U.S. economy which picked up 
noticeably. The manufacturing sector was poised 
to recover steadi ly following the gradual pick -up in 
domestic and external demand. In this connection, 
manufacturing output in July rebounded to record 
a small growth vis -à-vis the average, after the 
significant contraction in last quarter.   
Going forward, it was assessed that 
consumption would gradually resume growth while 
government stimulus and recovery in exports 
would bring about positive impact  on growth.  
In 2014 Q3, the Chinese and Asian 
economies (excluding Japan) expanded at a 
similar pace to last quarter. Exports  which 
recovered steadily helped offset some impact of 
the domestic demand slowdown.  
In 2014  Q2, the Chinese economy  grew 
by 7.5 percent (yoy), accelerating from 7.4 percent 
in the previous quarter due mainly to the pick-up in 
investment that in part stemmed from government 
stimulus, for example,  the expedition of infrastructure  
investment and measures to support the agricultural  
sector and SMEs. Meanwhile, exports improved 
and led to a shrink in trade deficit from t he first 
quarter. The manufacturing sector also benefited 30                          Monetary Policy Report  September 2014  from the pick -up in exports particularly electronics 
and machiner y in line with the increase in orders, 
especially from the U.S. and euro area economies .  
The outlook in 2014 Q3  for the Chinese 
econ omy pointed to a  marginal slow down from the 
previous quarter. Export growth remained high 
following the firming up of U.S. economy and new 
model  launch es in the latter part of the year 
according to the global electronic s cycle. 
However, domestic spending w as likely to slow 
down. Though infrastructure investment was 
assessed to pick up steadily in line with continued 
investment  acceleration measures, overall investment  
would still slow down mainly from investment in 
real estate as over supplies were noted in many 
provinces. Manufacturing investment was also 
poised to slow down due to overcapacity in many 
industries such as the me tal and cement 
industries. Meanwhile, some moderation in 
consumption could be expected due to the impact 
of government measures to control spending on 
luxurious good s.  
In this regard, the Chinese government 
remained committed to pursue economic reforms 
in order to facilitate long -term sustainable growth. 
Measures to curb financial risk from the growth of 
shadow banking businesses  began to diminish 
lending by non -bank financial institutions. 
Nonetheless , the Chinese government would try to 
maintain short -term growth and introduce targeted 
stimulus measures to support certain sectors that 
were impacted from its reform efforts.  
In 2014 Q2, Asian economies (excluding  
China)  expanded at a similar pace to the previous 
quarter (Chart 2.4)  thanks to the pick-up in  
exports. Meanwhile, domestic spending slowed 
down  due to the elevated household debt and

decreases in the number of Chinese tourists in 
Hong Kong and Singapore. Investment also 
moderated, especially real estate investment, after 
significant accelerations were continually recorded 
for many years. The i nvestment slowdown could 
also be attributed to stricter lending practice by 
financial institutions. Nonetheless, the manufacturing 
sector registered some impr ovement, especially  
export -oriented industries.  
In 2014 Q3, it was assessed that economic 
activities in Asian countries would remain stable. 
The steady improvement in exports, especially 
electronics, was expected to remain a key engine of 
growth and help offset the impact of domestic 
spending  slowdown . Moreover, the manufacturing 
sector would  expand continually as reflected by  the 
Purchasing Manager’s  Indices  (PMI) of many 
countries which stayed beyond the 50 point mark 
for many consecutive months.  
2.2 The domestic economy   
 In 2014 Q2, the Thai economy expanded 
modestly. Improvement in private c onfidence 
helped consumption recover though investment 
continued to stall as businesses waited  to reassess 
future economic prospects  and government  
policies. Meanwhile, fiscal stimulus was able to 
boost th e economy to only some extent. 
Manufacturing production and imports still 
contracted as firms continued to discharge 
inventories. Export -oriented production began to 
pick up in line with gradual improvement in exports.  
 32                          Monetary Policy Report  September 2014   Economic conditions in 2014 Q2  
 In 2014 Q2, the Thai economy expanded 
modestly by 0.4 percent from the same period last 
year (Chart 2.5)  due to strong growth in 
agricultural production. Meanwhile, manufacturing 
production still contracted and tourism -related 
services continued to be influenced by the political 
situation during the beginning of the quarter . 
 Agricultural production  in 2014  Q2 
expanded  by 2.2 percent from the same period 
last year (Chart 2.6)  owing to increases in output 
of rubber and oil palm in line with expansion in 
farming areas in previous periods. Off -season rice 
production also increased thanks to higher 
irrigation water availability compared to last year. 
Nonetheless, cassava production decreased as 
farmers substituted plantation with sugar cane.  
Shrimp production continued to be affected by  
the Early Mortality Syndrome (EMS). However, 
agricultural  prices declined from the same period 
last year due to the government’s expedition of 
rice stock discharge and the decline in rubber 
price following high global supply . 
 Looking ahead, it was expected that 
agricultural output would pick up continually from 
the same period  last year in line with production of 
rubber and oil palm. However, agricultural prices 
were likely to decline mainly due to rubber price.  
 The manufacturing production in 2014 
Q2 contracted by 1.6 percent from the same 
period last year. Both d omestic and external 
demand picked up  but inventories which remained 
high in many industries caused production to 
improve  only marginally as reflected by a 
contraction in the Manufacturing Production Index 
in 2014 Q2 (Chart 2.7).  Subsequently, capital

2.8). In this connection, domestic -oriented 
manufacturing production contracted in line with 
domestic demand due in part to the lingering 
political situation and reduction in aut omobile 
production following the expiration of the first car 
tax rebate scheme.   
 Export -oriented manufacturing production 
improved thanks to the increase in overseas 
orders for electronic equipment s and Hard Disk 
Drive s (HDD), particularly cloud computing HDD, 
and the short -term demand for new computer 
models to replace old ones. Meanwhile, production  
of frozen shrimp continued to contract due to 
supply shortage following the outbreak of EMS.  
 Looking ahead, manufacturin g production 
was likely to remain stable for some time . Given 
that inventories remained  high in many industries  
(Chart 2.9)  and firms continued to discharge old 
stock, production increase would not yet take 
place despite the increase in demand . 
 Activities  in the trade sector  expanded 
modestly by 0.3 percent from the same period last 
year owing to household and government  
spending. The w holesale sectors which recorded 
high growth included agricultural raw material, 
food, fuel, and construction material. Lik ewise, the 
retail sectors which expanded well included food 
and beverage and department store as reflected 
by improvement in consumer confidence during 
the end of the quarter.  
 The service sector  continued to be 
influenced by consumers’ lack of confidence  on 
the economic prospect s and political situation. 
Thus, the sector expanded only modestly by 2.4 
percent from the same period last year. The hotel

level of travel advisories, resulting in reductions  
in the number of tourists from many regions 
especially Asia, the U.S. and the Middle East 
during 2014 Q2. In this connection, occupancy 
rate declined to 47.4 percent, the lowest level  
in three years. (Chart 2.10)  
 In 2014 Q3, the number of tourists was 
assessed to decline from the same period last 
year. Looking ahead, however, the tourism sector 
was expected to recover gradually in tandem with 
improvement in sentiment and promotional 
measures as reflected by  gradual lifting s of travel 
advisories by some countries and the return of 
Asian tourists.  
 The construction sector  contracted by 
3.2 percent from the same period last year though 
contraction was less severe compared to the 
previous quarter as reflected by  a pick -up in 
construction activities of both the public and 
private sectors and in line with an increase in 
cement sales from the previous quarter. However, 
capital budget disbursement which continued  
to lag behind especially for large projects led to  
an overall contraction in the public sector’s 
construction activities.  
 The r eal estate sector  contracted slightly 
by 0.7 percent from the same period last year in 
line with the contraction in construction activities. 
Such  development owed to a decline in rea l 
estate -related services  which resulted from 
developer’s slowdown of new project launches to 
await clearer signs of economic prospects. Going 
forward, it was assessed that the real estate 
sector would pick up following improvement in

 The economic slowdown in 2014 Q2 
caused employment to contract continually, 
particularly in the agricultural sector, following lack 
of incentives to increase plantatio n due to 
unfavorably low prices. Employment in the 
construction sector also declined. Nonetheless, 
tight labor market conditions and the labor 
shortage problem were in part responsible for 
causing the unemployment rate to edge up only 
marginally and contin ue to be low in 2014 Q2,

private consumption  edged up slightly from the 
same period last year (Chart 2.12).  The increase 
in private consumption of 0.2 percent owed to the 
continual improvement in consumer confidence,  
after the political situation gained greater clarity 
and public policies became more concrete and 
expedited. Examples included the expedition of 
debt repayment to farmers in the rice pledging 
scheme, the maintenance of the value added tax 
and the maintenan ce of oil and LPG prices. With 
additional support from farm income which 
increased in line with improvement in output, 
purchasing power was enhanced esp ecially in 
spending on  semi -durables, non -durables and 
services. Spending on durables also recorded 
some improvement though it continued to contract 
from the same period last year. For July, private 
consumption continued to pick up in tandem with 
steady improvement in consumer confidence, 
resulting in a continual growth in consumption of 
non-durables. Meanwhile, consumption of durables  
began to signal improvement though a contraction 
was still noted given the acceleration of 
automobile purchase in prior periods and financial 
institutions’ heightened lending practice to 
households. (Chart 2.13)  
 In 2014 Q2, private investment  contracted  
by 7 percent from the same period last year 
(Chart 2.14)  in line with investment in machinery 
and equipment and construction as most 
businesses de cided to postpone investment to 
reassess future government policies and economic 
prospects. Nonetheless, private investment signaled  
some recovery as contraction became less severe 
in July following  the resumption of investment by 
some firms that received the BOI’s investment

with improvement in business sentiment as reflected  
by the Business Sentiment Index (BSI).  
 In 2014 Q2 and subsequently in July 2014 , 
merchandise exports  recovered gradually. In 
2014 Q2, the volume of exports grew by 1.5 
percent from the same period last year (Chart 
2.15)  in tandem with exports of agricultural and 
manufacturing products which  expanded well. For 
agricultural products, im provement was noted 
especially for rice due to a decrease in price which  
resulted from the government’s rice stock 
discharge, and cassava due to rising demand from 
China. Manufacturing exports picked u p thanks to 
exports of machinery, petrochemical produc t and 
electrical appliance . However, automobile exports 
slowed down in tandem with  the decrease in 
demand from major trading partners, particularly 
Australia and Asia. Meanwh ile, exports of fishery 
product  continued to be affected by  the disease 
outbreak i n shrim p.  
 In 2014 Q2, exports of services  contracted  
by 8.4 percent from the same period last year, 
continuing on from the first quarter in which the 
political situation escalated. The contraction owed 
to the announcement of travel advisories by many 
countries which affected foreign tourists’ 
confidence and coverage of travel insurance 
policies. Subsequently, the number of foreign 
tourists continued to decline especially the 
majority from Asia, for example, China, Malaysia, 
Singapore and Japan who were ge nerally more 
sensitive to political factors. However, the tourism 
sector began to recover in July as reflected by 
improvement in the number of Asian tourists 
following the unwinding of political tension  coupled 
with promotional activities of both the public and 
private sectors.

sluggish recovery in exports led to a rather 
significant contraction of 10.8 percent in 
merchandise imports in 2014 Q2 (Chart 2.16).  In 
particular, imports of capital goods, raw materials 
and intermediate goods (excluding crude oil) 
contracted in tandem with manufacturing activities 
along with private investment and merchandise 
exports which recovered only slowly. Meanwhile, 
imports of co nsumer goods contracted at a 
smaller rate due to improvement in private 
consumption.   
 In 2014 Q2, public expenditures  declined 
in line with the contraction in capital expenditure 
as the political situation led to some delay in  
the purchase and acquisition process which 
subsequently caused budget disbursement to be 
less than targeted. Moreover, most non -budgetary 
spending was also pushed back, espe cially  
the water management project which needed 
additional review. Nonetheless, disbursement of 
current expenditure namely salaries , wages  and 
purchases of goods and services expanded 
modestly. (Chart 2.17)  Overall government revenue  
collection declined owing to the reduction in 
income tax, especially corporate income tax which 
owed to the economic slowdown in prior periods, 
the decline in automobile excise tax which 
followed highly accelerated sales in prio r periods, 
and the continuous contraction in import tax due to 
the slowdown in merchandise imports. However, 
public expenditures which continued to exceed 
revenue collection reflected that government 
stimulus still retained its role in supporting 
economic  growth in this quarte r.

Inflation  
Headline inflation over the first two months 
of 2014 Q3 came in below expectation at 2.13 
percent and slowed  down from last quarter in line 
with prices of energy and raw food. The p ass-
through of LPG price to prepared food prices 
decelerated in 20 14 Q2, causing core inflation  to 
slow down . (Chart 2.18)   
Prices of energy decelerated from the 
previous quarter owing to the reduction in 
domestic retail oil prices. The trend was consistent 
with that of  global crude oil price which declined 
due to  the unwinding of market concerns over the 
effect of geopolitical risk in oil producing countries 
on their exports and ultimately the global supply. 
Prices of raw food also slowed down continually 
from last quar ter due to  the reduction in prices of 
vegetables and fruits which owed to the increase 
in output, along with  the deceleration in prices of 
meat, especially pork, after the disease outbreak 
started to unwind.  
Core inflation over the first two months of 
2014 Q3 came in close to projection at 1.82 
percent (Chart 2.19)  and slightly edged up from 
the last quarter in line with prices of food and 
beverage as the pass -through from LPG price to 
prepared food prices continued. However, the 
upwards adjustment of prepared food prices 
appeared to slow down since most firms had 
already increased prices in prior periods. Hence, 
core inflation began to decelerate. Meanwhil e, 
prices of non -food and beverage continued to 
stabilize in line with costs and the slowly 
recovering domestic demand. (Table 2.2)

Production cost conditions  
Overall production cost conditions remained  
benign as the Producer Price Index rose by a 
mere 0.7 percent during the first two months of 
2014 Q3, decelerating from last quarter (Chart 
2.20)  due to prices of mining product and petroleum  
product  which followed the declining trend in 
global oil price.   
Inflationary pressure in the perio ds ahead  
Inflationary pressure  in the next two 
quarters  was likely to decline in line wit h the 
decrease in costs following the reduction in the 
global oil price, along with the gradual recovery in 
domestic demand. In addition, the pass -through of 
costs to prices of prepared food which had been 
significant in recent periods started to gradually 
ease and was now expected to end in 2014 Q4 .

quarter -on-quarter percentage change calculations by Bank of ThailandMonetary Policy Report  September 2014                  41 (1) Cost pressure was projected to decline 
slightly mainly in line with the trend in global oil 
price. Meanwhile, non -fuel commodity prices and 
fresh food prices would likely stabilize. It should be 
noted that the announcement of a restructuring  
of domestic energy prices on August 29, 20146/, 
did not lessen cost pressure by much since  the 
reduction in prices did not apply to the types of 
fuel that were major inputs  in the transportation 
and manufacturing  sectors . Nonetheless, the planned  
restructuring of domestic energy prices to better 
reflect costs was likely to continue in the p eriods 
ahead. In particular, further increase s in diesel oil 
price would likely have an effect on inflation and 
raise cost pressure.  
(2) Demand pressure continued to be 
benign and was not expected to cause excess 
demand in the economy since recovery remained 
only gradual.  
(3) Inflation expectation stabilized close to 
last quarter’s level as reflected by businesses’  
12-month -ahead inflation expectation in July 2014 
which stood at 2.9 percent. (Chart 2.21)  
Concerning the short -term outlook of 
inflation, it was asses sed that headline inflation 
over the next two quarters  would decline in line 
with a slowdown in 1) core inflation, owing to 
gradual dissipation of the pass -through of cost to 
prepared food prices; and 2) energy prices, 
particularly domestic retail oil pric es, in line with 
the restructuring of domestic energy prices 
announced  on August 29, 2014, coupled with the 
declining trend in global oil price .

3.1 Financial markets   
Money market interest rates remained 
stable in line with the policy interest rate. 
Government bond yields adjusted downwards 
overall  in line with higher  demand from both  local 
and foreign investors which partly owed to improving  
confidence on Thailand’s  economic prospects.   
Money and bond markets  
Short -term money market interest rates 
remained stable close to the policy interest rate in 
line with the MPC’s decisions on August 6 and 
September 17, 2014, to hold the policy interest 
rate at 2.00 percent per annum. As of September 
18, 2014, the interban k lending rate and the 1 -
month government bond yield stood at 1.90 and 
2.00 percent per annum, respectively. (Chart 3.1)   Thailand’s overall economic and financial stability was well maintained. 
Money market interest rates remained stable in line with the policy interest rate. 
Expansions of deposits and credits decelerated in tandem with the economy. 
Financial institutions’ financial strength continued to be sound. Fragilities in non -
financial institution sectors lessened owing to the economic recovery as reflected 
by improvements in household income and sales of businesses. The real estate 
sector also picked up in line with private confidence.  
 The MPC assessed that s alient risks that needed to be monitored in the 
periods ahead included (1) monetary policy divergence between major economies  
which could le ad to global financial market volatility; (2) geopolitical risk which 
could affect trading part ner economies, tourism, oil price s and investor sentiment; 
and (3) production constraints which could affect exports and needed to be 
resolved to facilitate sust ainable economic growth in the long -term.

quite stable . Mean while , medium -to long -term 
government bond yields decreased in tandem wi th 
higher demand from foreign investors which owed 
to improving confidence about Thailand’s economi 
prospects. Demand from local investors also 
edged up due to replacements of maturing saving s 
bonds. In addition, decrease in new auctions of 
medium -term government bonds at the end of 
2014 Q3 also supported the yield drop. Overall, 
Thai medium -to long -term government bond yields 
continued to move in line with U.S. government 
bond yields, which edged lower, owing in p art to 
investors’ concerns over the escalating geopolical 
risk between Russia and Ukraine. Nonetheless, in 
mid-August  2014 , medium -to long -term government  
bond yields adjusted slightly upwards due to local 
investors’ profit -making sales following the 
antic ipation  that the Fed could begin to normalize 
the fed funds rate earlier than expected, given  
the firming up of U.S. economic data, especially 
labor market data. As of September 18, 2014, 
Thai 10 -year government bond yield decreased by 
approximately 20 bps  from the end of June  2014 .

between Russia and Ukraine  and Argentina’s  
default . However, foreign investors began to 
return to the Thai market from July 2014  onwards

August  2014 . (Chart 3.4)   
Salient risks to keep abreast in the periods 
ahead included the increase in the fed funds rate 
and the worsening outlook of geopolitical tension 
between Russia and Ukraine. Thailand’s economic  
prospects in the latter half of the year could also 
lead to som e volatility in the SET Index.  
 Foreign exchange market  
The Thai baht depreciated slightly against 
the U.S. dollar towards the end of 2014 Q3 as  the 
market assessed that the Fed would begin 
normalizing the fed funds rate sooner than 
expected. (Chart 3.5)  For the whole quarter, 
however, the Thai baht appreciated from last 
quarter and was less volatile relative to major and 
regional currencies. (Charts 3.6 and 3.7)  
The appreciation of the Thai baht in  2014  
Q3 owed mainly to (1) the improvement in investor 
confidence regarding the Thai economic prospects 
after the political situation and public policy  
direction  gained more clarity; and (2)  the ongoing 
implementation of accommodative monetary policy  
by major economies. While there was n  o signal 
for the timin g of interest rate increase in the U.S., 
the ECB lowered the policy interest rate further 
and announced an asset purchase plan for the 
next periods. Meanwhile, the Japanese economy 
trended downwards and the government was 
likely to introduce further econom ic stimulus 
measures. Hence, foreign investors gradually 
returned to invest in Thailand after a period of 
outflows due to the political tension. The Thai 
baht, thus, strengthened especially against major 
currencies such as the U.S. dollar, the euro and 
the Japanese yen, as reflected by an increase in 
the Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER)

the NEER. In this regard, the NEER and REER 
both returned to their previous levels before  the 
political situation in Nove mber 2013 .  
Towards the end of the quarter, the Thai 
baht depreciated slightly as the market assessed 
that the Fed would begin normalizing the fed funds 
rate earlier than expected, causing the U.S. dollar 
to appreciate against major and regional currenci es. 
As of September 18, 2014, the Thai baht stood at 
32.26 baht per U.S. dollar, appreciating by 0.6 
percent from the end of last quarter. Looking 
ahead, there was potential for monetary policy 
divergence to occur in major economies given that 
the U.S. eco nomy was likely to firm up while euro 
area and the Japanese economies continued to 
slow down.  This development could result in 
higher volatility in the global financial market.

quarter to support higher demand for credits  that 
was expected to follow  the economic recovery .

Deposit rates of the four largest commercial  
banks2/ during July  – August 2014 stabilized from 
the end of 20 14 Q2. At the end of August  2014 , 
interest rates on the 12 -month deposits of the four 
largest commercial banks recorded at 1.73 percent 
per annum. Nonetheless,  many commercial banks 
and SFIs began to mobilize deposits by introducing  
special depos it products since June  2014 , partly to 
support higher demand for credits which was 
expected to follow the economic recovery .  
The average Minimum Lending Rate (MLR)  
of the four largest commercial banks stood at 6.75 
percent per annum, unchanged from the end of 
2014 Q2.  
Growth in other depository corporations’  
private credits continued to decelerate in 2014 Q2. 
At the end of July , private credits expanded by 6.4 
percent from the same period last year, slowing 
down from 8.8 percent recorded at the end of the 
first quarter (Chart 3.9)  in line with both household  
and corporate credits due to low demand and 
somewhat tighter credit standards. Credit to 
household sector  slowed down mostly in line with 
auto leasing. Meanwhile, corporate credits slowed 
down as businesses postponed investment in 
order to reassess futuere economic prospects.  
A number of large corporates also moved to raise 
funds by issuing corporate debenture s in order to 
lock-in interest rates. (Chart 3.10)  In this connection,  
overall monetary conditions continued to be 
accomodative and did not impose restrictions on 
business operations. (Chart 3.11)

new private credi ts in July  2014  (Chart 3.12)  in 
part due to gradual increase in demand for credits 
coupled with SFIs’ credit stimulus measures. 
Looking ahead, it was anticipated that private 
credits was likely to expand in tandem with the 
gradual economic recovery. Nonetheless, financial 
institution s were expected to maintain high credit 
standards in order to reassess future economic 
prospects.  
 In 2014 Q2, deposits and bills of exchange 
(B/E) continued to moderate. At the end of July, 
deposits and B/E expanded by 3.6 percent from 
the same period l ast year, slowing down from 6.8 
percent recorded at the end of  2014   Q1 (Chart 
3.13) , owing to the slow down in  both consumer 
and corporate deposits which followed the trend in 
private credits. Moreover, savers also reallocated 
their savings to invest in  higher -return assets as 
deposit rates were unattra ctively low . Nonetheless , 
towards the end of the quarter, competition for 
deposits through launches of special deposit 
products increased slightly due to higher demand 
for credits that was expected to foll ow the 
economic recovery. Overall, growth in private 
credits continued to be higher than deposits, 
resulting in a small increase in the Loan to 
Deposits and B/E Ratio (LDR) from 96.2 percent 
at the end of 2014 Q1 to 97.7 percent at the end 
of July  2014 . (Chart 3.14)  Going forward, it was 
deemed that competition for deposits would rise 
continually in order to match  the expected higher 
demand for credits.  (more details in Box:  Liquidity

Stability of financial institutions in 2014 Q2 
remained sound. Despite some impact of the 
economic slowdown which caused private credits 
growth to decelerate and loan quality to deteriorate , 
provisioning for loss and dou btful loans continued 
to be high to absorb potential uncertainties.  
In 2014 Q2, commercial bank profitability 
improved from the first quarter. Operating profit 
increased from a decline in interest payment 
which owed to lower competition for deposits 
following a slowdown in both corporate and 
consumer credits. As a result, net profit rose 
slightly from 50.5 billion baht at the end of last 
quarter to 59.8 billion baht this quarter. (Table 3.1)  
Stability of financial institutions remained 
sound overall. The Capital Adequacy Ratio 
remained  high at 15.9 percent, increasing from 
15.5 percent at the end of last quarter. Moreover, 
commercial banks continued to increase provisioning  
for loss and doubtf ul loans in order to absorb the 
impact of potential uncertainties. In this regard, the 
ratio of actual loan loss provision to regulatory 
loan loss provision  stood highly at 169.2 percent 
at the end of 2014 Q2. However, there was some 
signal of deterioratio n in loan quality which owed 
primarily to consumer loans. In this connection, 
the delinquency and NPL ratio of consumer loans 
rose from 5.8 to 6.0 percent. (Chart 3.15)

Percent50    Monetary Policy Report  September 2014   3.3 Non-financial sectors  
Fragilities in the non -financial sectors 
reduced as the economy was expected to pick up. 
Improvement in outlook was reflected by 
recoveries in household income and business 
sales. Meanwhile, the real estate sector recovered 
in line with private confidence.  Debt servicing 
ability of households remained an important risk to 
monitor in the periods ahead while risk of the real 
estate sector was not yet a concern .  
Household sector   
Debt service burden  of households continued  
to be high and resulted in some det erioration  
in the quality of consumer loans. However, 
improvement in  the economic outlook gradually 
benefited household income, particularly non -farm 
households , and helped mitigate  fragilities  on the 
whole .  
Overall employment conditions were strong  
where the umemployment rate  in 2014 Q 2 remained  
low at 1.0 percent. Recent recovery in economic 
conditions led to greater household confidence 
and while farm -income continued to decline in line 
with contractions in agricultural prices, non -farm 
income bega n to pick up steadily. (Chart 3.16)  
Improvement in non -farm income helped support 
recovery of household consumption, particularly, 
that of non -durables which began to accelerate.  
In this regard, househ olds continued to  be careful  
in new debt accumul ation w hile financial institutions  
remained cautious in extending consumer credits. 
Thus, growth in household debt decelerated 
continually from 11.4 percent at the end of 2013 to 
9.9 percent at the end of 2014 Q1. (Chart 3.17)

financial assets to household debt which stabilized 
at 2. (Chart 3.18)   
Debt servicing abiity of households 
deteriroated slightly in this quarter in part due to 
the elevated household debt which accumulated 
significantly in prior periods. In this regard, the 
delinquency and NPL ratio of consumer loans rose 
from 5.8 percent at the end of 2014 Q1 to 6.0 
percent at the end of 2014 Q2, mainly due to auto 
leasin g and other personal loans. (Table 3.1)  
Looking ahead, debt servicing ability of households  
continued to warrant close monitoring, especially 
low-income households which generally had 
higher debt burden than other g roups. 
Corporate sector  
In 2014 Q2, corporate profitability (especially  
that o f Small and Medium Enterprise s; SMEs) 
became more evidently impacted by the economic 
slowdow n, though implications were contained  in 
certain manufacturing sectors. However, overall 
stability of the corporate sector was well maintained  
and some sectors such as the real estate and 
manufacturing  sectors , already resumed growth at 
the end of the quarter . 
Corporate  profitability in 2014 Q2  declined 
slightly from last quarter as reflected by the Net 
Profit Margin (NPM) which decreased from 5.0 
percent in 2014 Q1 to 4.7 percent in this quarter. 
(Table 3.1)  In particular, tourism -related industries 
such as the hotel and restaurant  industries , were 
significantly affected by the political situation 
coupled with the fact that the period was low-
season.  (Chart 3.19)  It should be noted that  after 
the political situation unwound at the end of 2014 
Q2, signs of recovery  were already noted  in the

respectively. (Chart 3.20)  
Overall  stability of the corporate sector 
was well maintained. Retained earnings continued 
to be higher than its 10 -year average. Corporate 
debt and liquidity was also well guarded  where the 
Debt to Equity (D/E) Ratio and the Current Ratio 
(CR) in 2014 Q2 registe red at 0.8 and 1.5, 
respectively , staying  close to their 10 -year averages . 
Looking ahead, it was  expected that stability of  
the corporate sector would improve following  
the economic recovery during the latter half of  
the year.  
Real estate sector  
Real esta te markets in Bangkok and its 
vicinities started to recover in line with p rivate 
confidence which rebounded due to improvement 
in economic conditions and political situation. In 
the short -term, however, risk of the real estate 
sector was not yet a concern.   
Real estate  activities started to pick up 
since the end of 2014 Q2 both in terms of demand 
and supply, in line with private confidence which 
rebounded due to improvement in economic 
conditions and political situation . The improvement 
was reflected by a continual increase in the number 
of new launches especially  in condominiums 
(Chart 3.21 ), in line with  the unit reservation rate 
(3-month moving average) which rose from the 
record -low of 15 percent in February to 20 percent 
in July  2014 . Most of this incr ease stemmed from 
pent-up demand from the beginning of the year, 
particularly  for condominiums, as buyers postponed 
purchases previously to reassess future economic  
prospects and political direction .

rates would induce speculative real estate 
activities was not yet a concern. In this regard, the 
proportion of additional  home mortgages  (non-first 
home)  in 2014 Q2 continued to stabilize from the 
end of last yea r (Chart 3.22)  as buyers remained 
cautious in their spending and new debt 
accumulation while financial institutions continued 
to apply high credit standards. As a result, the 
Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR) in July  2014  
remained close to its 5 -year aver age of 4.4.  
(Chart 3.23)  
Going forward, the real estate sector was 
poised to recover steadily in tandem with the 
economy.  The outlook was in line with financial 
institutions’ assessment that demand for new 
mortgages would increase. Nonetheless, in the 
short -term, risk of a real estate bubble was not 
great.  
Fiscal sector  
Stability of the fiscal sector continued to be 
sound. The high level of treasury balance helped 
cushion the impact of lower -than-targeted revenue 
collection. Meanwhile, the ratio of public debt to 
GDP edged up slightly but remained comfortably 
below the th reshold of concern. Looking ahead,  
a fiscal reform, both in terms of revenue and 
expenditure, would help enhance stability of 
Thailand’s fiscal sector in the long -term.  
Stability of the fiscal sector continued 
to be sound owing  to the followings. 1) The 
high level of treasury balance helped cushion 
the impact of lower -than -targeted revenue  
collection.  At the end of July  2014 , treasury 
balance stood at 346 billion baht. While treasury 
balance declined from the same period last year, it 
was in part  due to the fact that revenue collection

2012 2013 2014Times54    Monetary Policy Report  September 2014   over the first 10 months of the fiscal year was 132 
billion baht below target due to the economic 
slowdown and  the postponement of increase in 
excise tax for diesel oil. Nonetheless, this level of 
treasury cash bala nce was  judged to be  high 
enough to provide reserve for the government in 
necessary times. In addition, the restructuring of 
domestic retail oil price in August  2014  which 
called for an increase in excise tax for diesel oil 
and a decrease for benzene oil . With higher usage 
of diesel oil) , it was expected to improve revenue 
collection slightly ; and  2) the ratio of public debt 
to GDP edged up slightly from 45.9 percent in 
May 2014  to 46.9 percent in July  2014  but 
remained lower than the fiscal sustainability 
threshold (Chart 3.24) . The increase in debt was 
due mainly to borrowings to fund debt re payment 
to farmers in the rice pledging scheme .  
Looking ahead, a fiscal reform on revenue 
by increasing the income  tax base, and on 
expenditure by implementing a sound auditing 
system  especially  for non -budgetary expenditure, 
would help enhance stability of Thailand’s fiscal 
sector in the long -term.

 57 Monetary Policy Report  September 2014  Liquidity  and its implications  on commercial banks’ deposit mobilization  
 For many years, the Loan -to-Deposit 
Ratio (LDR) have risen continually,  (Chart 1)  
leading to the question of whether  if liquidity 
has tightened and subsequently, if there is a 
need for commercial banks to adjust deposit 
mobilization strategy. This article aims to shed 
light on liquidity condition s and outlook 
together with its impact on commercial banks’ 
deposit mobilization and monetary policy 
transmission.   
Liquidity assessment  
 The LDR compares the volume of 
loans to deposits, which is the main source of 
funds of commercial banks. An increase in  the LDR signals that commercial banks lend more than 
it can raise funds. Hence, many people are concerned that a continual decrease in the LDR may 
imply that commercial banks do not possess adequate liquidity to extend credits in future periods.  
 In pract ice, commercial banks consider many factors when conducting liquidity 
assessment , namely 1) quantity and quality of liquid assets whereby highly liquid assets have 
more potential to absorb outflows vis-à-vis other asset types; 2) deposit structure which di ctates 
the quantity and speed of deposit outflows. For example, time deposits turn over slower than 
current deposits; 3) credit target which depends on the economic outlook and future demand for 
credits; and 4) degree of liquidity risk that a commercial ba nk is willing to tolerate. If a commercial 
bank has a high degree of tolerance to such risk, it may allow credits to expand more highly.  
 As above, it can be seen that the LDR is only a preliminary indicator of liquidity since it 
cannot reflect changes i n other dimensions, for example, quality of liquid assets, deposit structure 
and changes in behavior , namely adjustment in credit target and risk management practice. To 
illustrate, consider two commercial banks with exactly the same LDR. One commercial ba nk may 
possess higher liquidity vis -à-vis the other if the former holds liquid assets of more superior quality, 
has a more stable deposit structure or uses a higher credit target. These differences cannot be 
revealed by the LDR.  
Recent liquidity conditions   
One explanation for the continual 
increase in the LDR over time is that new 
loans cannot generate new deposits by the 
same r ate. This factor stems  from savers’ 
reallocation of savings towards investment in 
higher -return assets such as stock, mutual 
fund and life insurance as a result of the low 
deposit interest rate environment. A study 
reveals that when the stock market performs 
better than deposit, households will increase 
their stock holding and decrease their savings  
accordingly . (Chart 2)

Spread of stock market return over

sector that could potentially affect economic recovery because : 
1) Commercial banks have retain ed a 
high portion of liquid assets.  The ratio of liquid 
assets to deposits has continue d to be higher 
than historical average (Chart 3),  reflecting that 
commercial banks had enough liquid assets to 
absorb deposit outflows during previous periods.  
2) Competition on  deposit mobilization 
has cooled down in recent times  due to low 
demand  for credits and commercial banks’ 
strengthening of credit standards. Thus, 
requirement of deposits for on -lending has been 
minimal. Moreover, some commercial banks have 
also adjusted their  deposit structures by slowing 
down deposit mobilization in order t o reduce 
cost of fund through interest expense. Such behavior reflects that commercial banks do not have a 
liquidity concern so that they do not need to compete for deposits as has previously been the case 
during the economic upturn and high demand for cre dits.  
3) Subsidiaries of commercial banks have launched new products to match savers’ needs,  
for example, mutual fund and life insurance. Hence, money from new loans has  actually stayed 
within the banking group though not in the form of new deposits.  This development may also 
explain why commercial banks do not need to raise new funds much.  
Outlook for liquidity and deposit mobilization  
Looking ahead, competition on deposit 
mobilization is likely to pick up from rising 
demand for credits in line with im provement in 
private confidence  and clarity on government 
policies. However, competition is not expected to 
be as strong as in 2013 given that economic 
recovery is still in its early phase and demand for 
credits continue to be below normal. Commercial 
bank s also continue to maintain strict credit 
standards for some types of loans. In addition, 
competition on deposit mobilization from Specialized  
Financial Institutions (SFIs) has also decreased 
from previous periods. Thus, commercial banks 
do not have a grea t need for deposits yet. 
Concerning strategy, it is expected that commercial banks will continue to launch special deposit 
products rather than compete by raising  interest  rates of normal time deposits. Some new 
launches of special products are being carri ed out at present as commercial banks view that 
economic recovery will be gradual following the political change.  (Chart 4)   
Summary  
Recently, commercial banks’ liquidity has not tightened so much that it imposes 
restrictions on economic recovery. Despite an increase in the LDR, commercial banks continue to 
hold adequate level of liquid assets and are ab le to raise funds by offering other types of assets 
that are more attractive to savers during the low deposit interest rate environment. Looking ahead, 
the steady increase in demand for credits may cause deposit mobilization to pick up but 
competition is not expected to be strong. Given that interest rates on normal time deposits 
continue to stabilize in tandem with the policy interest rate, commercial banks are more likely to 
raise funds by offering special deposit products.
