The Monetary Policy Report  is prepared quarterly by staff of the 
Bank of Thailand with the approval of the Monetary Policy Committee 
(MPC).  It serves two purposes: ( 1) to communicate to the public the  
MPC’s  consideration and rationales for the conduct of monetary policy, 
and (2)  to present the latest set of  economic and inflation forecast s, based 
on which  the monetary policy decisions  were made .

Monetary Policy in Thailand  
The Monetary Policy Committee  
Under the Bank of Thailand Act, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) comprise s the 
Governor and two deputy Governors, as well as four distinguished external members  
representing various sectors of the country, with the aim of ensuring  that monetary policy 
decisions are effective and transparent.  
The Monetary Policy Objective  
The MPC sets monetary policy to promote  the objective of supporting sustainable a nd full 
potential economic growth, without causing inflationary problems or economic and financial 
imbalances or bubbles.  
The Monetary Policy Target  
The Cabinet  approved the annual average headline inflation target of 2.5 + 1.5 percent as the 
monetary policy target for 2015, in place of the quarterly average core inflation target of 0.5 – 3.0 
percent . The new inflation target  was jointly proposed by the MPC and the Minist er of 
Finance. In the event that headline inflation deviates from the target, the MPC shall explain 
the reasons behind the target breach  to the public, together with measures taken and 
estimated time  to bring inflation back to the target.  
The Monetary Policy Instrument  
The MPC utilizes the 1 -day bilateral repurchase transaction rate as the policy interest rate to 
signal the monetary policy stance.  
Evaluati on of Economic Conditions and Forecasts  
The Bank of Thailand takes into account  information from all sources, the macroeconomic 
model, data from each economic sector, as well as surveys  of large enterprises , together with  
small and medium -sized  enterprises from all over the country,  and various financial institutions  
to ensure that economic evaluations and forecasts are accurate and cover all aspects, both at 
the macro and micro levels.   
Monetary Policy Communication  
Recognizing the importance of monetary policy communication to the public, the MPC 
employs  various  channel s of communication, both in Thai and English, such as (1) organizing 
a press statement at 14.00 on the day of the Committee meeting, (2) publishing edited 
minutes of the MPC meeting two weeks after the meeting, and (3) publishing the Monetary 
Policy Report  every quarter.  Monetary Policy Report  June  2015

1.1 Growth and inflation prospects  
The economy is projected to recover  at a 
slower pace than assessed in the previous 
Monetary Policy Report. Thai exports fell short of 
expectation due to a combination of factors. First, 
global economi c recovery was held back by 
subdued  growth in the U.S., China and Asia. The 
changing global trade structure  also prompted  
Thailand’s major trading partners to rely less on 
imports  (Article in Box 1: The Changing Global 
Trade Structure and Implications on Exports of the 
ASEAN -5 Countries ). Moreover , the Thai exports 
sector continued to suffer from  structural problems . The Thai economy is likely to expand  at a slower pace than the previous 
projection mainly on the back of weaker -than-anticipated  exports. Sluggish  global 
economic recovery, changing global trade structure, and more pronounced 
structural constraints in the Thai exports sector together contributed to the 
subdued exports . The contin ued decline in exports adversely affected  Thailand’s 
economic recovery through lower income, confidence and private spending. 
Meanwhile, robust tourism sector and higher public spending, particularly  
investment expenditure, provide d support to the economy, but could not fully 
offset the impacts of aforementioned negative factors.  
Inflationary pressures subsided mainly from supply -side factors , causing 
headline inflation to remain in a negative  territory  for longer than previously 
assessed. However, headline inflation is expected to pick up  in the second half of 
2015 and mo ve closer to the inflation target in 2016, as the base effects of high 
oil price begins to wane , coupled with expected rises in oil and raw food prices. In 
the light of higher economic downside risks and muted inflationary pressure, the 
MPC lowered the pol icy rate at the  April meeting to support economic recovery.  2    Monetary Policy Report  June 2015   Falling exports had adverse impacts on employment,  
income s and household confidence, thereby 
offsetting the positive effects of low oil prices  
and more accommodative  monetary conditions.   
In addition , financial institutions remai ned cautious in 
lending to households,  contributing to slower -than-
expected  recovery  of household consumption.   
Private investment is projected to rebound at  
a slower  pace than previously assessed due to 
weakening  external and internal demand s. Feeble  
demand s dampened  private sector confidence , 
prompting firms  to delay their new investment until 
clearer signs of demand recovery emerge d. Public 
spending , especially  investment expenditure  picked 
up more  strongly  than projected , helping to  spur 
investment  by private firms benefitting  from 
government investment projects.  Meanwhile, t ourism 
is projected  to post a solid growth throughout the 
forecast period, especially in 2015.  
However, accelerating fiscal  spending and 
robust tourism growth could not offset the negative 
impacts from contracting  exports and  private 
spending.  The MPC  thus projected the Thai 
economy to grow by 3.0  percent  and 4.1 percent in 
2015 and 2016 respectively (Table 1.1) . 
With inflationary pressure s having 
dropped  below the assessment in the last 
Monetary Policy Report , the Committee  revised 
down headline and core inflation forecasts 
throughout the forecast period.  Headline inflation 
forecast is adjusted down wards  primarily  because of 
supply -side factors , particularly with o il prices 
remaining  at low levels . The reduction of the 
contribution  rate to the Oil Fund  caused retail oil 
prices  to increase by  less than the rise in  global oil 
prices. Moreover, raw food prices  poste d a larger 
drop than projected due to an oversupply of

At the same time, demand -side inflationary pressure s 
weakened in line with slower -than-expected recovery.  
Negative h eadline inflation is thus likely  to persist 
longer  in 2015 . Nevertheless, headline inflation  is 
expected to pick up gradually in the second half of 
the year  and move closer to the  inflation  target  
in 2016, on the expectation that the  base effects of 
high oil price  will begin to wane while energy  and 
raw food prices will increase.  Core inflation remains 
positive but is projected to decline , in line with  weak 
demand -side pressure s resulting from the persistent 
negative  output gap.  The MPC  considered  deflation 
risks to be  low, as  private  consumption continued  
to expand, prices of most goods and services 
remained  stable or rose, and inflation expectation s 
were close  to the target (Table 1.1 and Chart 1.1) . 
The Committee factored the following key 
developments into the growth and inflation forecasts.  
(1) The global economy is projected to 
grow at slower rate than formerly  forecast, due 
to a slowdown in the U.S., Chinese and Asian 
economies, along with shifting  global trade 
structure (Table 1.2).  
Throughout the forecast period,  the quantity  
of Thai exports was  hit by t he s lower -than-
expected global recovery, along with  the recent 
changes in global trade structure that caused 
Thailand’s  main trading partn ers to reduce  their 
reliance  on imports and switch  to locally made  
products. This  reduced Thailand’s benefits from 
the global economic recovery . The prices of Thai 
exports are projected to remain steady at low 
levels due to soft demand. Moreover, Thai exports 
suffer ed from structural constraints . The lack of  
new investment and product development to  
meet the dema nds of the global market lowered

(13 countries)4    Monetary Policy Report  June 2015   Thailand’s competitiveness. Rectifying these 
structural problems will take  time.  
Moreover, in recent periods certain groups 
of Thai exports  were affected by exchange rate 
movements,  particularly  for goods where Thailand 
competed with other countries whose currencies  
had become significantly weaker against the  baht.  
Nonetheless, the weaker baht in 2015 Q2 following 
the policy rate cut, coupled with the ensuing 
announcement of BOT’s measures on capital flows 
relaxation , should boost  exporters’  profits in baht 
terms  and provide additional  support for the price -
sensitive  exports sectors  somewhat . However, the 
positive effects may not be immediately  felt because 
it takes time for foreign buyers  to revise their orders.                
In addition, the prices of Thai exports may have to 
be lowered  in some  product categories where Thai 
exporters have weak negotiation power s over prices, 
thereby limiting the positive impacts of the weaker 
baht.  
Exports of services posted a solid expansion  
from the grow ing number of  Chinese tourists , 
supporting the economy. The lifting of martial law in 
April 2015 and more apparent signs of recovery  
in the euro area economies pointed to  a brighter 
outlook  for the  tourism sector  in periods ahead . 
The contraction of exports curbed 
employment  in the manufacturing exports sector . 
Falling h ousehold incomes and eroding confidence  
prompt ed consumers to be more cautious with 
spending.  Slow economic recovery further weakened  
business confidence  which, combined with sizable  
excess production capacity, led the private sector to 
delay investment plans. Meanwhile, sluggish global 
recovery continued to weigh down commodity 
prices, especially agricultural prices, and continued Monetary Policy Report  June  2015                                                                                      5 to impact farm income s and private consumption in 
the next  periods .  
In the MPC’s view, global economic 
growth could turn out to be below  the base case 
scenario  for the following reasons:  (1) The economic  
slowdown in China could be worse than assessed  
due to the lower -than-expected  impact from 
government stimulus; (2) China’s economic 
slowdown could weigh down ASEAN economies  
more than  expected; and  (3) The recovery of the 
euro area economies could be slower than expected,  
should Greece’s default cause  excessive volatility 
in financial markets  and erode  investor confidence.  
(2) The government provides additional 
boost to the economy through public investment.  
The Committee revised up wards  the 
assumptions on public spending  as the central 
government managed to  accelerat e the disbursement  
of public investment  expenditure in early 2015. This 
was partly because the public sector  had entered 
into contracts for investment projects more quickly 
and in greater amounts than expected , which helped 
sustain  public investment spending.  Moreover, the 
government announced further extra -budgetary 
spending under the second phase  of the fiscal 
stimulus . Major investment plans , including  water 
management system and urgent road transport 
infrastructure development , are likely to provide 
ongoing boost to the economy . However, there were  
delays  and revision s of plan  in some state enterprise 
investment projects , such as the  second phase of 
the Suvarnab humi Airport development plan . 
Going forward , higher and sustained public 
spending will underpin private sector confidence and 
shore up  private investment by firms  involved in the  
government projects.  The impacts are likely to be 
more pronounced in late 2015 and 2016 when the 6    Monetary Policy Report  June 2015   construction of public infrastructure projects is 
scheduled to begin and larger  budget disbursement s 
are expected.  Moreover , the water management and 
road transport development plans consist mostly of 
small and medium spending projects which can b e 
implemented  relatively swiftly.  These projects can 
thus provid e an immediate  boost  to employment and  
income s in local areas , thereby helping to revitalize  
household consumption  to some extent . 
The Committee assesse d the risk of public 
spend ing overshooting the base line projection  to be 
higher than that of public  spending undershooting it . 
The central government might be able to  expedite 
extra -budgetary spending through the water 
management and road transport development 
projects more qu ickly than currently assessed .  
This will alleviate  some of  the labor constraints in  
the construction sector especially in the later part of 
the forecast period , as well as facilitate  the 
implementation  of projects  under the normal 
budget ary process . Nonetheless, the downside risk 
that budget disbursement  capacity  might not keep 
pace with the b udget  increase  requires ongoing 
monitoring.  
(3) The increase in global oil prices in  
2015 Q2 . 
The Committee slightly revised up wards  the 
baseline assumption for crude oil price in 2015 from 
60 to 61.7 U.S. dollars per barrel . The revision 
followed the larger -than-expected increase in oil 
prices in 2015  Q2, fueled  by stronger global demand 
amid st global economic  recover y as well as  
moderating rate of increase in U.S. oil production  
from closure s of some oil fields . Meanwhile, c rude 
stockpiles  began to decline, contributing to the 
higher oil prices. Looking ahead , however,  the rise in 
crude prices are likely to be limited  on the following Monetary Policy Report  June  2015                                                                                      7 grounds : (1) Demand remain s soft amid st slow 
global recovery . (2) Supply should increase as  shale 
oil production in the U.S. resume s, with higher oil 
prices making  production viable again . The MPC 
therefore maintains the crude  price baseline 
assumption for 2016 at 70 U.S. dollars per barrel  
(Chart 1.2) . 
Higher oil prices will put upward  pressure 
on the prices of other commodities that exhibit a 
high degree of comovements wi th oil prices, giving 
a boost to  our exports. Moreover, higher crude price 
will translate into higher  domestic  retail oil prices, 
which will in turn push headline inflation up to 
positive territory in Q4 2015 and subsequently  to a 
level close to the inflation target in 2016.  
According to the MPC’s evaluation,  the 
crude  price could undershoot the baseline 
assumptio n, on the back of higher -than-expected 
oil supply driven  by the following f actors:  (1) Iran 
could resume exporting oil if the negotiation on the 
lifting of sanctions is successful . (2) OPEC 
countries could raise oil production by more than 
previously assessed in order to  maintain market 
share.  (3) Shale oil producers could further 
expand production due to greater production 
efficiency. Meanwhile, demand for oil could fall 
below the expected level, in line with the pace of 
global recovery  which may fall short of the 
baseline assumption . 
Downside Risks to Growth and Inflation Forecasts  
 According to the MPC’s assessment,  
the probability that growth will be below  our 
baseline projection is higher than the probability  
that it will be above the baseline pro jection. 
This assessment is depicted in the growth fan 
chart, which is skewed downward s throughout 
the forecast period (Chart 1.3).

from the following:  (1) The  pace of global economic 
recovery could be slower than anticipated , especially 
in China and Asia . (2) The negative impacts of the 
shifting global trade structure on Thai exports  
could be greater than expected. (3)  Public spending 
could fall short of anticipation due to  limitations in 
disbursements , especially for investment projects.  
Upside Risk factors to growth  could arise 
from the following sources: (1) Public spending 
could exceed the previous forecast due to quicker 
implementation of second -round fiscal stimulus 
measures, which could in turn spur more private 
investment . (2) Crude oil prices could be below  
the baseline projectio n, providing  support  to the 
pick-up in household spending.  
The Committee  judge s that headline and 
core inflation are more likely to fall below  
the central projection than to surpass it.  
The greater downside risk  is reflected in the 
inflation fan charts that are skewed downward s 
throughout the forecast period (Charts 1.4  
and 1.5). The assessment is based on the risk 
factors concerning crude oil  prices and the 
possibility that economic growth would be lower 
than the baseline projectio n.

 Monetary policy  stance  has become 
more accommodative . 
 Monetary policy has played a  greater role 
in supporting economic recovery during 2015 Q 2, 
amid st greater  downside risks and subdued 
inflationary pressure s. At the meeting on April 29, 
2015, the MPC voted to reduce the policy interest 
rate by 0.25 percent, following the previous rate  
cut in March.  
After the MPC’s decision to lower the 
policy rate by 0.25 percent at the meeting on 
March 11, 2015, the overall monetary conditions 
became more accommodative. Commercial banks’  
deposit and lending rates  gradually declined , 
accompanied by lower  government bond yields 
across all maturities. These  adjustments partly 
eased the financial burden and financing costs 
faced by the business and household sectors.  
The baht  depreciated  for brief periods following 
the reduction in the policy rate, but subsequently 
rose due to external factors . 
At the meeting on April 29, 2015, the MPC 
agreed that Thailand’s economic growth in 2015 
would fall short of the earlier assessment, and that 
various monetary policy tools must be used to 
further ease financial conditions.  The Committee 
thus voted 5 to 2 to redu ce the policy interest rate 
by 0.25 percent, from 1.75 percent to 1.50 percent.  
The MPC had a thorough deliberation on 
monetary policy space, in the light of the  uncertain 
prospects of  internal and external factors.  The 
Committee considered the effective l ower bound  
of the policy rate  to be above  zero percent. Should 
the policy rate move to  very low levels, the  interest 10    Monetary Policy Report  June 2015   rate transmission mechanism could become more 
limited. This is because, e ven if the policy rate 
were to fall below the effective lower bound, 
commercial banks might not be able to cut lending 
rates any further  given the constraints of their 
asset c omposition and funding structure .  
Furthermore, d espite the historically low 
rate of 1.25 percent in the wake of the global 
financial crisis in 2009, the Committee  judged that 
the effective lower bound of the policy rate 
depends  on the prevailing economic and financial 
environment  at particular moments . These 
conditions,  such as loan quality outlook, saving 
alternatives  and level of competition i n the 
financial sector, could deviate from the past.  
Aside from the above policy deliberation , 
the MPC discussed the possibility of stronger 
growth momentum in 2015 Q2. The Committee 
paid considerable attention to  the fiscal boost and  
the risks posed to Thai exports  stemming from the 
slowdown in Thailand’s major trading partners  and 
structural  changes in global trade . In the light of 
these downside risks, the majority of the MPC 
members deemed a policy rate reduction 
necessary as a pre-emptive  measure to  bolster to 
the economy. They judged that the rate cut would 
not only reduce  the financial burden of business 
and household sector s, but also lead to exchange 
rate adjustments  that are  more  conducive to 
economic recovery. Moreover, given  that headline 
inflation could remain below the lower bound of 
the target for longer than expected, the policy rate 
cut would help anchor inflation expectations and 
ease deflation  risks which , although still low, had 
increased slightly since the previous M PC meeting.  
 Monetary Policy Report  June  2015                                                                                      11 Nonetheless, the minority of the MPC  
members  believed that policy space should be 
preserved for  countering  future risks, such as the 
slowdown of the Chinese economy and domestic 
political uncertainties. Furthermore, the  effects of 
the policy ra te reduction on March 11 had not 
been  fully transmitted to the real economy , 
highlighting  the need to evaluate the impacts on 
the economy and financial stability before any 
additional easing monetary policy.  Meanwhile, 
higher fiscal spending and more accommodative  
monetary conditions should help foster the 
econom ic recovery  to a certain degree . 
The decision to reduce the policy interest 
rate this time further eas ed monetary conditions , 
particularly through the exchange rate  adjustment . 
The baht depreciation was partly a result of the  
ensuing announcement of BOT’s  measures on 
capital flows re laxation on April 30, 2015 . The 
MPC  noted and  agreed with the BOT’s  plans to 
relax foreign exchange regulations under the 
Capital Account Liberalization Master Plan.  The 
Committee also realized the importance of the 
BOT’s effective communication  with the public to 
promote better understanding of exchange rate 
movement and its economic  impacts . This would 
help the business sector adapt and manage 
exchange rate risks  more effectively  under 
different circumstances . 
Subsequently at the meeting on June 10, 
2015, the Committee unanimously decided  to 
maintain  the p olicy rate at 1.50 percent. The MPC 
believed th at the pace of Thailand’s economic 
recovery was still close to the assessment made 
in the previous meeting.  Growth momentum in 
2015 Q1 and April softened from feeble private 
spending  and continued contraction in exports,  
in part a result of a slowdown in the Chinese   12    Monetary Policy Report  June 2015   and Asia n economies  as well as a shift in the 
global trade structure. Nevertheless, improved 
disbursements  of public investment expenditure 
and robust tourism growth continued to provide 
support to the economy.  
Headline in flation continued to  stay in a 
negative territory due  mainly to energy costs and 
raw food prices . Core inflation remained positive 
but edged slightly  downward  due to subdued 
demand -side pressure . The MPC considered 
deflation risks to remain low on the grounds that  
private consumption continu ed to expand , prices 
of most  goods and services were  stable or  rose, 
and inflation expectation s remained close to  the 
inflation  target.   
The Committee judged that the conduct of 
monetary policy had thus far eased monetary 
conditions, while the directi on of exchange rate 
movement had become more conducive to  
the economic recovery.  Nonetheless, the Thai 
economy still faced downside risks, especially 
those stemming from sluggish global recovery , 
especially China and other Asian economies.  
Going forward, the Committee will closely monitor 
Thailand’s economic and financial developments  
and stand ready to utilize the available policy 
space appropriately to ensure  sufficiently 
accommodative monetary conditions  to foster a 
recovery  of the Thai economy . The MPC  will also  
assess financial imbalances that could  build up in 
a prolonged low interest rate environment , thereby 
ensuring  the country’s long -term financial stability.

Percent2016 2015Monetary Policy Report  June  2015  17 The changing global trade structure and implications for  export s 
of ASEAN -5 countries1/ 
While the global economy has 
been recovering since 20 13, the benefit s 
of this recovery  on export s of ASEAN -5 
countries , both in terms of export value 
and quantity , was relatively  low. The 
total export va lue of the ASEAN -5 
economies grew  on average  by only  
4 per cent per year  over the  2011 -2014 
period, compared to  the 14 -percent 
annual growth rate  during 2002 -2007 
(Chart 1) . The marked decline in  export  
growth  could  be attributed to the 
followi ng changes in the global trade  
structure:  
(1) A slowdown in the global  trade growth , especially in the aftermath of the financial 
crisis in 2008 -2009. The volume of  world trade grew by  only 4 per cent per year during  
2011 -2014, moderating from the 7 -percent growth  per year  over the 2002 -2007  period . Both 
cyclical and structural factors have played some  roles in the slowdown, including:  
  (1.1) The global economy  remains weak,  due to the slowdown of the Chinese 
economy from ongoing structural reform s, and the sluggish recovery of the euro area and 
Japan ese economies . Moreover, commodities are among the key export products  for the 
ASEAN -5 economies, but global commodity prices remain low.  
 (1.2) The shift in the import pattern s in several countries, particularly the U .S. and 
China, as reflected in the decreasing import s-to-GDP ratio (Chart 2) . The post -crisis import s-
to-GDP ratio for the  U.S. has fallen from 13.2 per cent during  2006 -2007 to 12.8 percent  
during  2011 -2014. This can be attributed to (1) a decrease in oil import s, thanks to  
improved drilling technology which leads to increased domestic production of shale gas and 
shale oil, and (2) a decrease  in import s of consumer products , which may be attributed,  
in part, to the rapidly narrowing labor cost gap between the U .S. and developing countries. 
This argument is striking  for China,  whose labor cost has been on the rise. Over the  2002 -
2012  period , the labor cost  gap between the U.S.  and China has shrunk by about 75 percent . 
American  companies therefore have more incentives to produce onshore  (Chart 3) .

 Meanwhile, China has increased its share of spending on domestic ally produced 
goods including  raw materials, intermediate  goods , and consumer goods  in response to the 
country’s ongoing economic reform s which promotes the development of domestic industrial 
clusters.  The result of the  reform polic ies is reflected by the increase in the ratio of goods 
produced for domestic consumption to total production in China  across  all goods categories 
(Chart 4) . Moreover, since 2011, the reform s have shifted the  growth  driver for the Chinese 
economy from an investment -led growth model to a consumpti on-led one. This has reduced 
China’s reliance on  commodity import s, which constitute  the majority of imports from ASEAN -5. 
Indeed, China is the world’s largest importer of commodities, with its share making up   -60 
percent  of total global import s. Imported commodities are mostly used for investment  purposes , 
i.e. steel, coal, aluminum and copper  (Chart 5) . 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
     (1.3) The development of industrial clu sters in the ASEAN -5 countries. Foreign 
direct investment (FDI) in emerging markets over the  past 10 years , which had gone  into the 
development of upstream, midstream and downstream industries, have brought about a 
decline  in the export s of intermedia te goods by Asian countries. (For more detailed analysis, 
please refer to the article “The Shifti ng Global Trade  Structure”  in the June 2014 Monetary 
Policy Report.)

percent  of total global export s in 2011 to 5.9 percent  in 2014. By contrast , the global market 
share  of exports from  Emerging and Developing Europe2/ grew from 3.1 percent  to 3.4 
percent , while the global market share of exports from  CLMV  countries3/ increased  from 0.6 
percent  to 1.1 percent  during the same period. The decline in market share of  exports of 
ASEAN -5 countries could  be attributed to the following factors:  
       (2.1) ASEAN -5 countries’ declining competitiveness against countries with lower 
production cost s, especially labor cost s such as Vietnam. This is reflected by  the continued 
increase in Vietnam’s share in total  imports to the U.S., the euro area , Japan and China 
(Chart 6) . This is due partly to the relocation of the production base for electronics and 
electrical appliances  from ASEAN -5 countries to Vietna m to take advantage of the  lower  labor  
costs .4/ 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       (2.2) Some of the ASEAN -5 countries’ failure to adapt to changing global consumer  
preferences,  such as the shift in demands away  from computers to smart phones and tablets. 
ASEAN -5’s inability to adjust in a timely manner to build new productive capacity for smart 
phone s and tablet -related  products cause d their export s to decline.  
Based on  the above  factors, even if the global economy expands more robustly  in the 
near future , the export s of ASEAN -5 countries may not benefit from  global growth to the same 
degree as  they did in the past. This further emphasizes the ne ed for  the ASEAN -5 economies 
to upgrade their  production technology and adapt their production  capability  to meet  the rapidly

benefit s from global economic recovery. It is, however, worth noting  that s ome ASEAN -5 
countries have already imple mented economic reforms  in respons e to the changing global

Program (ETP) since 2010, with a goal to upgrade its production  capability , boost ing export

should place priorities on  upgrading country’s export s structure, in order to enhance its 
production capabilities  and competitiveness in the global market.

2.1 The global economy  
The global  economy  expanded  at a slower  
pace  than assessed  in the last monetary  policy   
report  due to slower  growth  in the U.S.,  Chinese  
and Asian  economies . Meanwhile , the euro area 
econom ies exhibited  clearer signs  of recovery .   
Advanced  economies  still posted  positive  
growth  despite  a temporary  slowdown  in the U.S. 
(Chart  2.1). In 2015  Q1, the U.S. economy  
contracted  by 0.7 percent  (qoq saar,  second  
estimate),  following  2.2 percent  growth  registered  
in the previous  quarter.  Economic  activities  were  
disrupted  by temporary  factors , such  as the   The global  economy  expanded  at a slower  pace  than previously  projected  
mainly  as a result  of weaker -than-expected  US economic  growth  in 2015  Q1, and 
economic  slowdown  in China  and other  Asian  economie s (excluding  Japan)  
owing  to sluggish  exports . Going  forward , the global  economy  is likely  to face 
higher  risks from the slowdown  in the Chinese  economy  and uncertainty  over 
Greece’s  financial  situation.  
  The Thai economy  continued  to recover  albeit  at a slower  pace,  owing  to 
the ongoing  decline  in exports  since  the beginning  of the year.  Weak  exports  
adversely  impacted  employment,  income  and dented  private  sector  confidence,  
prompting  households  to be more  cautious  regarding  their spendin g. As a result,  
businesses  delay ed plans  for capacity -expansion  investment.  Nonetheless,  
robust  tourism  growth  and improving  budget  disbursements  for public  investment  
assumed  greater  roles in driving  economic  growth.  
  Inflationary  pressures  were  generally  weaker  than assessed,  due largely  
to cost factors.  Headline  inflation  remained  negative,  but should  gradually  edge  
up in the latter  half of the year.  The MPC  assessed  the deflation  risk in Thailand  
to remain  low.

Japan)  exhibited  slower  growth  in 2015  Q1, owing  
primarily  to weaker  exports.  In particular,  exports  
to China  and regional  economies  continued  to 
decline,  on the back  of weak  demands  from 
trading  partners  and changes  in global  trade 
structure  (Article  in Box 1: The Changing  Global  
Trade  Structure  and Implications  for Exports  of 
ASEAN -5 Countries ). Preliminary  economic  data in 
2015  Q2 indicated  that the continued  weakness  in 
export  growth  has had adverse  impacts  on the real 
economy.  Manufacturing  production  has continued  
to slow since  the beginning  of 2015,  consistent  with 
the Purchasing  Managers’  Index  (PMI) being  below  
50 in almost  every  country  in the region . Domestic  
demand  in Asian  economies  (excluding  China  and 
Japan)  began  to show  signs  of moderat ing, with 
falling  investment  in machinery  and equipment  
reflected  by the decline  in imports  of machinery  and 
equipment  in several  countries.  Despite  sharply  
lower oil prices,  private  consumption  began  to fall 
because  declining  manufacturing  employment  and 
weaker  consumer  confidence  led the private  sector  
to be more  cautiou s with spending .  
Looking  ahead,  the Committee  judged  that 
the global  economy  would  continue  to recover , albeit  
at a more  modest  pace.  Downside  risks to growth  
are now more  than previously  assessed,  especially  24       Monetary Policy Report  June  2015   from the Chinese  economic  slowdown.  Additional  
risks are from the uncertainty  over finding  a resolution  
to Greece’s  financial  rescue  plan, and divergent  
monetary  policies  of major  advanced  economies , 
which  could  lead to greater  volatility  in the financial  
markets.  
The U.S. economy  will gain momentum  
from improv ing economic  fundamentals,  especially  
from the continued  recovery  of the labor  market  
where  employment  and wages  are picking  up. The 
private  sector  balance  sheet  will also strengthen  as 
a result  of continued  deleveraging.  Nonetheless,  
further  risks remain  from the sustained  strength  of 
the U.S. dollar  and greater  financial  market  volatility  
stemming  from the expectation  of the Fed’s  interest  
rate hike.  
The euro area econom y are projected  to 
recover  gradually  from the ECB’s  continuation  of 
easing  monetary  policy.  Going forward , however,  
economic  activit ies and confidence  in the euro area 
could  weaken  if the Greek  government  and its 
creditors  fail to reach  an agreement  on debt bailout  
terms  and structural  reforms.   
The Japanese  economy  is expected  to 
expand  at a gradual  pace.  The conclusion  of the 
negotiation  on annual  wage  rise could  lead to a 
signifi cant increase  in wages  in mid-2015,  which  
should  provide  a boost  to consumption.  Export  
growth  should  benefit  from continued  yen weakness , 
but could  be curtailed  by the slowdown  in China  and 
the rest of Asia.  However,  the Japanese  economic  
growth  in the long run is largely  dependent  on the 
outcome  of structural  reforms.  
The Chinese  and other  Asian  economies  
are likely  to grow at a slower  pace,  due mainly  to 
weaker  exports.  In the periods  ahead,  exports  from 
China  and other  Asian  countries  (excludi ng Japan)  Monetary Policy Report  June  2015                              25 are projected  to edge  up slowly.  However,  exports  
growth  is expected  to be lower  than the rate 
recorded  in the years  preceding  the global  economic  
crisis,  because  of the ongoing  slowdown  in China  
and the shifts  in global  trade  structure.  
2.2 The  domestic economy  
The pace of Thailand’s economic recovery 
slowed in 2015 Q1 (Chart 2.3).  The decline in 
exports since the start of the year was a result of 
sluggish global recovery and structural changes i n 
global trade that altered the contribution of global 
recovery to Thai economic growth. Weaker exports  
lowered employment, income and private sector 
confidence, prompting households to restrain 
spending.  Likewise, the business sector cut 
production and postponed investment that woul d 
upgrade  production capacit ies. In contrast to these 
setbacks, the tourism sector continued to expand 
and disbursements of government investment 
budget  became important driver s of growth. The 
policy rate reduction helped lower financial burden 
to some degree , but its effects on domestic demand  
were not evident  yet. 
Exports fell in quantity and price terms  
Exports contracted from the previous 
quarter, both in terms of quantity and price , 
due to structural and cyclical  factors . Structural 
problems included  the following : (1) Structural 
changes in global trade prompted major trading 
partners to rely less on imports.  As a result ,  
Thai export quantity benefited less from the 
recovery in trading partners’ economies  than in 
the past (Chart 2.4) . (2) Thailand’s international 
competitiveness declined as a result of higher

termination  of GSP  privileges  for Thai exports to 
the euro area  (Article in Box: Structural Problems 
in Thai Exports Sector ). Cyclical  factors were:  
(1) The slowdown in trading partners’ economies, 
especially China, hurt exports of ASEAN countries.  
(2) Prices of several export product s, such as 
commodities , plastics and chemicals, remained 
low in line with  crude oil price . 
Going forward, the Thai exports are 
constrained  by both the slowdown in trading 
partners’ economies and structural issues . Exporters  
need time to explore  new markets and develop 
higher value -added products.  However, in the 
short term,  the recent baht depreciation should 
help increase liquidity  for Thai export ers somewhat  
via higher revenue  in baht term.  
Households remain cautious with  regards 
to spending  
Private spending  recovery remained 
sluggish as non -farm incomes fell ( Article in Box: 
Changes in Household Incomes and Implications 
for Economic Recovery ). Other factors, i.e. falling 
farm incomes and private sector confidence, 
continued to weigh on private consumption (Chart 
2.5). Household debt levels were  persistently  high, 
while financi al institutions remained strict with 
lending  standards  to households  as the quality of  
consumer loans  worsened  (Chart 2.6) . In the 
periods ahead, consumption is likely to pick up 
slowly amidst these existing constraints. Although 
employment in 2015 Q2 edge d up slightly from  
the past quarter, the increase was mostly in   
the sectors  with relatively low wage per hour. 
Therefore, consumers  continued to remain cautious  
with their spending amidst concerns over future 
income  prospect . Nonetheless, the decline in

debt burden  for households.  In addition, s ome 
public financial institutions are also preparing  
to relax their lending standards in 2015 Q2 to 
provide support to private consumption, in line 
with government policy.  
Weak domestic and external demand 
prompted firms to cut back production  and delay 
investment plans for capacity expansion . 
Manufacturing production edged down 
from the previous quarter from the decline in 
manufacturing exports (Chart 2.7). Hard Disk 
Drive (HDD)  production fell significantly because 
more consumers switched to advanced computer 
components made of solid -state dri ve (SSD) . 
Mean while , some HDD factories also shut down 
for maintenance. Electronics production contracted  
amidst falling domestic and external demand, 
compounded by  the relocation of production base 
of major TV manufacturers to other countries   
in the region . Nevertheless , production of some 
manufacturing items expanded.  For example,  
automobile production  for exports  grew , especially  
in eco-cars and pick -up trucks  destined for the 
Australian and European markets. In addition, 
integrated circuits (IC) ma nufacturing was still in 
an expansionary phase (Chart 2.8) . 
Going forward, the recovery of the 
manufacturing sector will hinge mainly on the 
recovery of domestic and external demand, along 
with the ability to  upgrade  Thailand’s competitiveness.  
Private investment expanded at a slower 
pace amidst weak domestic and external demand.  
The business sector still  had ample spare production  
capacity, particularly export s manufacturers  whose  
capacity utilization was lower than other sectors

new investment, awaiting greater clarity on 
economic recovery and gover nment  plans on  
infrastructure investment. This is consistent with 
declining private sector confidence and private 
credit (Chart 2.10) .  
Imports dropped in line with subdued 
production and investment  
Imports edged down from the p revious 
quarter (Chart 2.11) . Imports of raw materials, 
excluding fuels and chemicals, contracted in line 
with declining manufacturing production. Imports  
of capital goods continued to shrink , consistent 
with subdued investment s. Fuel imports remained  
at very low level due to weak crud e oil prices. 
Imports of consumption goods edged up slightly 
because the rise in the number of  foreign tourists 
led to highe r imports of some  consumer  products, 
such as cosmetics and watches.  
Tourism growth and public spending, 
especially investment expenditure, became  important  
driving  forces  for the econom y. 
Public spending, particularly investment  
expenditure, rose from the  past quarter (Chart 
2.12) . Broadly consistent  with the government’s 
policy, public agencies  were urged to expedite  
government  procurement  before the  enactment of 
the Annual Budget Expenditure Act and to  enter 
into contracts for public projects before Dece mber 
2014.  Consequently, disbursements  picked up pace  
in February and March 2015.  However, p ublic 
investment spending moderated slightly in April 
because it was not the  period scheduled  for the 
project handover and  budget disbursement  of 
investment projects.

to play a key support ive role for  economic growth. 
The government already approved the second 
phase of economic stimulus comprising road 
transport infrastructure and water management 
system projects. Quick disbursements for these 
investment plans are likely because they consist 
mostly of small and medium projects  with most 
completion due within one year . Local government 
spending  is expected to pick up slightly in the 
second half of th e budget year, due to the 
expedited signing of contracts for government  
projects and  the tendency that disbursements  of 
subsidies are normally  back -loaded . However, 
several government megaprojects are still in the ir 
initial phase and will take some time to  materialize.  
Examples of ongoing  projects are  rail system 
development, inter -city motorway construction, 
and highway development linking the East-West 
Corridor .  
Tourism posted a solid growth owing  
to the growing number of Chinese and Malaysian  
tourists , which  helped offset  the drop of Russian 
tourists attributed to Russia’s economic woes and  
sharp  ruble  weakness  (Chart 2.13).   
Looking ahead, tourism is projected to 
continue growing despite a downside risk 
concerning  Thailand’s i nternational aviation  safety  
standards.2/ This concern is unlikely to significantly 
impact the number of foreign tourists because th is 
issue mainly centers on charter flights. Foreign 
tourists will be able to  travel by scheduled flights 
                                                        
2/ In March 2015, the International Civil Aviation Organization  
(ICAO) announced that a safety oversight audit conducted  
in Thailand found “Significant Safety Concerns” (SSC) in 
two areas, namely (1) air operator certification procedures  
and (2) transport of dangerous goods.

sector is likely to benefit  from the lifting of martial 
law on April 1, 2015, as some foreign governments  
have removed warnings against travel to Thailand 
and as a result, tourists are now able to  purchase 
travel insurance.  
Service sector posted a solid growth on 
robust tourism industry  
Tourism -related s ervice sectors  saw  
a strong growth. Hotels, restaurants and 
transport ation, especially air transport, posted  
a solid growth. These  businesses benefited from 
the rise in  the number of  foreign tourists and 
added support  to the retail sector through tourists’ 
spending.  Other service  sectors  also exhibited a n 
elevated  growth . The t elecommunications  sector 
grew from increased  demand for data services . 
Financial intermediaries saw the expansion of 
services by other depository institutions, as well as 
by insurance and life insurance companies  (Chart 
2.14) . 
2.3 Production cost and price 
 conditions   
Inflationary pressure was weaker  than 
previously assessed. Headline inflation edged 
down and is expected to remain in negative  
territory for a longer period, mostly due to 
depressed energy and fresh food costs. However, 
headline inflation is expected  to pick up in the 
second half of the year, bottoming out  in Q2 
before gradually rising in Q3 and turning positive 
in 2015 Q4.  Although core inflation edged down 
mainly from food costs,  it is expected to remain

Committee considered  the overall deflation r isk  
to be low.  
Recently , inflation  readings  in several 
countries including those in Asia bega n to stabilize,  
consistent with global  crude  oil prices  and clearer 
signs of economic recovery especially in the euro 
area (Chart 2.15) . Thailand’s general price level 
continued to decline, with headline inflation 
recording an average of negative 1.16 percent  for 
the first two months of 2015 Q2  (Chart 2.16) , 
mainly due to cost factors. Despite a pickup in 
global oil prices and recent baht depreciation, 
domest ic retail oil prices remained  stable  at low 
levels  following  the government ’s decision to lower 
the contribution to the Oil Fund.3/ Moreover , 
declining  headline inflation also reflected the 
reduction in  the fuel adjustment charge (F T) 
during May -August 2015 by 0.0935 baht per unit , 
in line with lower fuel costs . Falling raw food prices  
from an  oversupply of meat and eggs, combined 
with weaker -than-expected demand recovery , also 
contributed to  the persistence of negative headline 
inflation. Negative h eadline inflation  was previously  
projected to remai n until 2015 Q2, but i s now 
expected to last well into 2015 Q3. Meanwhile, 
core inflation edged down to 0.94 percent in May 
2015, mostly from lower raw food costs that 
contributed to subdued  food prices. Prices of other 
goods and services rose from the same period last 
year, but remained mostly stable relative to   
2015 Q1, in line with weak domestic demand  
(Chart 2.17).  This was consistent with underlying  
                                                        
3/ The government cut contribution to the Oil Fund 4 times 
during March –May 2015. Consequently, the prices of 
benzene, namely gasohol 95, E20 and gasohol 91, and 
diesel fell by 3.00, 2.80, 2.10 and 2.30 baht per liter 
respectively.

in inflationary pressure and limitation  on the 
business sector to raise prices  (Chart 2.18) . 
Nonetheless, going forward headline 
inflation is expected to pick up mainly from cost 
factors . In particular, t he high base  effect of  oil 
price s during  the first half of 2015 wi ll gradually 
diminish . Moreover, global crude oil prices are 
expected  to increase, while raw food prices  
are likely to edge up when the problem of an 
oversupply of agricultural products  begins to 
subside . At the same time, demand -pull inflationary  
pressure  is projected to increase slowly in tandem 
with economic recovery. The MPC thus judged 
that headline inflation will bottom out in 2015 Q2, 
before picking up in Q3 and turning positive in the 
last quarter of this year. Core inflation remained 
positive, but is likely to trend down until early 2016  
due to its  high base in the previous year and weak  
demand -side pressure.   
Although he adline inflation is expected  
to remain negative for longer than previously 
assessed,  the Committee considered deflation risk 
to be low because private consumption continued 
to expand , while  negative headline inflation resulted  
mainly from falling  energy and raw food costs.  
Prices of most goods and services also remained 
stable or rose. In addition, short - and medium -term 
inflation expectations, while declining  slightly,  
were still close to the inflation target (Chart 2.19) . 
This suggests that the possibility of a downward 
spiral that could lead to deflation  remain s low. 
Likewise,  deflation indicators  pointed to low 
deflation risk over the coming month s. While 
slower - or weaker -than-expected recovery  could

The slowdown  of Thai exports over the past three  years has been in part attributed to  
the global trade slowdown, an external factor. It also , however, stemmed from  a number of 
domestic structural problems within the Thai exports sector that undermine d the 
country’s competitiveness . The Thai export  recovery was therefore more sluggish than that 
of other countries  in the region  (Chart 1) . Moreover, t he share of Thai exports in the global 
market has constantly declined  (Chart 2) , while  Chinese, Vietnamese and the Philippines 
exports continue to gain market shares. In case of Malaysian and Indonesian , though their 
market shares  for global exports have  fallen, the decline  is due mainly to lower prices of 
energy commodities , which are  their key exports  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Domestic structural problems  could result from the following  factors :  
1. Thai export quantity  expanded at a lower rate than the past average  because of  a 
persistent lack of new investment to expand existing  capacities.  Since 2012, Foreign Direct 
Investment ( FDI) flows have slowed  in several industries (Chart 3) . By contrast , Vietnam, the 
Philippines, and Indonesia have managed to consistently attract FDI  inflows  from large Multi -
National Corporations  (MNC s), due largely to lower labor costs, large labor forces , vast 
domestic market s and abundant natural resources .  
At the same time, outward direct investment by Thai businesses rose steadily.  
The steady increase in  Thai investment  abroad  in capital -intensive industries, such as 
petrochemicals and chemicals, was motivated  by the environmental concerns of these 
industries in Thailand. Labor -intensive industries, such as textiles and apparels, have also 
relocated to neighboring countries like Vietnam and Cambodia , to take advantage of  lower 
wages and greater tax incentives  under  Generalized Scheme of Pref erences (GSP) and 
bilateral Free Trade Agreements (FTAs). Thai exports of these products, therefore,  either 
stagnate d or declined  steadily .

2. Our export quality  failed 
to match the improvements made 
by our  regional competitors (Chart 4) . 
Thailand’s Export Sophistication 
Index  declined in recent years , 
while those of China and Vietnam 
posted continued gains , pointing  
to Thailand’s diminishing quality 
competitiveness  and greater reliance  
on unsophisticated exports.  Quantity  
of exports, particularly for farm and 
processed food products,  is also 
sensitive to labor costs, tax rates 
and the exchange rate  movements . Moreover, in the electronics sector, hard disk drive 
exports suffer from steadily lower  global demand. Despite the increase in export quantity of 
eco-cars, the value of total exports might not improve  significantly  because thes e type of cars  
command low price  per unit . 
Stagnant quality  of Thai exports is likely caused by  the following  key factors : 
 Thailand’s progress on upgra ding its r esearch and development  (R&D) capabilities  
lags behind neighboring countries.  Thailand has, for a long time, neglected the importance of R&D,  
unlike other regional countries where there have been sustained efforts, led  by the government,  
to develop research infrastructure.  The Global Competitiveness Report 2014 -2015  clearly 
highlights  this problem (Table 1) . The quality of institutions and human resource  readiness  in 
R&D in Thailand has been falling  behind countries  in the region . Likewise , Thailand still lacks  
the necessary basic infrastructure  that would create an envi ronment conducive for research,

 The quality of 
human capital in Thailand  
is lower than many other  
countries  in the region .  
According to  the 2015 human capital index , Thailand was ranked 57th out of a total of 124 
countries, well below neighboring countries like the Philippines and Malaysia . Despite a 
higher rank than Vietnam, China and Indonesia, Thailand’s score does not differ significan tly 
from the m. These countries  also have larger populations than Thailand. T hailand’s score 
highlights the inadequate development of 
education quality and labor skills. These 
human capital factors are vital for both 
improving export sophistication and attracting  
FDI inflows  into high value -added industries  
(Table 2 ). 
These structural problems have been 
accumulating  for quite  some time, but the 
consequence has become much  more visible 
today. In addition to t hese domestic issues , 
structural changes in global trade have 
weakened the links between the volume of 
international trade and global growth. These 
internal and external constraints  severely 
limit the ability of Thai exports to enjoy the 
high growth  rates  like in the past . While  structural changes in global trade are an external 
factor , beyond our control,  the domestic structural  constraints can be addressed , which will 
undoubtedly  take some time. Rectifying these problems requires close multi -sectoral  
cooperation, guided by a clear and coordinated reform plan.  The academic sector should 
play a role in conducting research and formulating clear approaches  to sol utions , while the 
government should support labor skills development and encourage investment that would 
enhance production capabilities and  improve  product quality. In addition, the private sector 
should be proactive in upgrading their competitiveness and product quality  in order to avoid 
price competition in the long term. Unless these internal structural problems are firmly 
addressed, it will be difficult for the Thai exports sector to resume its usual role as the  main 
driver of growth , which will hurt  Thailand’s long -term economic potential.

Household income is an important determinant of private consumption, a major driver 
of the Thai economy. In recent years , however, household income was hit by  the global 
economic slowdown, causing low agricultural prices and weak demand for Thai exports . Farm 
income,  therefore, remained subdued in tandem with weak agricultural prices . Moreover, 
employment in the manufacturing sector recovered only slowly, further depressing household 
non-farm income.  Weaker fundamentals of both farm and non -farm sectors played major role 
in impeding the recovery of private consumption in recent years .  
Farm income1/ remained low.  
Farm income has continuously declined 
over the past two years (Chart 1) , due 
mostly to dwindling income from rice and 
rubber sales, which together accounted 
for 45 percent of total farm income. 
Domestic rice prices plunged  following 
the end of the rice pledging scheme in 
February 2 014. Demand for rubber from  
large consumers , especially China and 
Malaysia, posted a significant drop , causing  
rubber prices  to have fallen since June 
2014.  Moreover , drought and low levels of irrigation water  in 2014  prohibited  off-season  rice 
farming in almost half of the cultivated areas, further depressing farm income. Going forward,  
the impacts of  these drawbacks will be felt for some time , putting downward pressure on  
the purchasing power  of farm households  for the remaining of this year . 
Non-farm income2/ started to edge down (Chart 1) in 2015 Q1 , against the backdrop 
of falling exports.  In contrast, the overall non-farm employment rebounded, in line with strong 
tourism growth and gradual  recovery of domestic spending. However, most of recent  
non-farm employment took place  in sectors with low to medium hourly wages (Chart 2 and 
Chart 3) , such as computers and electronics, food and beverages, hotels and restaurants, 
retail and land transport. While employment  recovered only slowly  in industries  with high 
hourly wages, for example automobiles, hard disk drives and chemicals, as well as in service 
sectors, such as telecommunications and financial intermediaries. Therefore, improved 
                                         
1/ The agricultural sector employs 12.7 million people (33 percent of total employed in 2014). The three most 
grown crops are rice, rubber and cassava, which account for 65, 25 and 10 percent of farm households 
respectively. Each farm household grows an average o f 1.6 types of crops.  
2/  The non -farm sectors employ 25.3 million people (67 percent of total employed in 2014) across a number 
of sectors: 6.4 million in manufacturing, 6.2 million in trade, 2.6 million in hotels and restaurants, 2.3 million 
in construct ion, 1.3 million in transport and telecommunications, and 6.5 million in others.

materially boost ed non-farm income.  
Over the coming months , constraints  
on exports recovery will continue to 
weigh on non-farm income and private 
consumption.  
Looking ahead, the overall 
recovery  of farm and non -farm income 
will be subject  to these constraints , 
unable to provide a major boost for 
private consumption.  Nevertheless, 
employment fundamentals generally 
remain sound, helping  household s  
retain  some degree of spending  power . 
Moreover,  the migration of labor   
from farm to non -farm sectors, both  
manufacturing and services,  leads to 
higher income for workers.  Although 
these  business sectors tend to pay low 
to medium wages, non-farm pay is still 
higher than f arm income during this 
period of subdued agricultural prices , 
contributing to higher income and 
purchasing power for these  workers.  
Furthermore, Thailand  enjoys higher 
productivity gains due to the migration 
of labor from farm sector, characterized  
by low productivity, to manufacturing 
and service sectors with higher 
productivity. However, over the long term, the lifting of our labor income requires rising  labor 
productivity, both in farm and non -farm sectors. Th is can be done through labor skill 
development and  adoption of appropriate innovation in production.

(3-month moving average, seasonally adjusted)Monetary Policy Report June 2015  39 Assessing the probability of deflation risks in Thailand  
With headline inflation remaining negative and declining by an average of 0.8 percent 
for the first five months of 2015, there could be mounting concerns over the risk s of deflation  
in the Thai economy . The MPC recognizes the importance  of communicating with  the public 
the definition , causes and impacts of deflation on the  economy and financial stability —and the 
assessment of the probability of deflation risk s in Thailand.  
There are narrow and broad definitions of deflation .1/ Defined narrowly , deflation 
refers to a sustaine d contraction of overall prices. However, this narrow definition is rather 
incomplete because it does not  factor in the causes and consequences of deflation.  On the 
one hand, d eflation may arise from supply -side factors . For example, higher labor 
productivity, more advanced technology, and lower costs of inputs could translate into lower 
production costs and a general decline in prices , which are beneficial to the economy. On the 
other hand, deflation may be driven by demand -side factors . For example, in a prolonged 
recession, people may expect a fall in future prices and, therefore, delay consumption. This 
will discourage production and private investment,  lowering employment, wages and income, 
and ultimately creating a deflationary spiral.  Therefore, an assessment of deflation risk s 
should make use of the broader perspectives  that take into account the causes  and 
consequences of deflation.  Broadly defined , deflation arises  when the price level is 
persistently falling across a broad -based range of goods and services, and when  the central 
bank fails to anchor public inflation expectations. In this broader view, deflation often occurs 
during a period of a prolonged contraction of  demand and employment, as was  the case of 
the U.S. and the UK  in the 1930s and Japan from the late  1990s to the early 2000s.  
Taking this broader perspective , the Tha i economy is not experiencing deflation.  
This is because the  current  negative headline inflation stems mostly from  the sharp decline  
in global crude oil prices given the excess supply of oil.  This development bene fits the Thai 
economy, given the country’s  heavy dependence  on imports  of oil . Subdued oil prices also 
reduced costs  for household and business sectors, while helping to su pport  private 
consumption.  In addition, t he fall in prices is concentrated in energy and food categories from  
supply -side factors. Although the public’s inflation expectations  moderated, they remai n close 
to the inflation target . More importantly , consumption continued to expand . Looking  ahead into  
the second  half of the year, the effects of a high base of oil prices will gradually diminish, 
while global  oil prices and fresh food prices  are expected to pick up . Taking into account 
these factors, the Committee projected headline inflation to bottom out  in 2015 Q2, before 
picking up and finally turning positive in 2015 Q4 . 
                                         
1/ For details on definition of deflation, refer to the article  by European Central Bank (2014), Monthly Bulletin, 
June 2014 . 40 Monetary Policy Report June  2015 Core inflation edged down  in early 2015 but remains positive. The decline in core 
inflation stem med from lower food prices, amidst an  oversupply of meat and eggs, as  well as , 
feeble demand.  If domes tic demand turns out to be weaker than the current projection, 
it could put downward pressure on core inflation to drop further in the future . 
Apart  from assessing  the outlook for inflation, the Committee considers other factors 
that could elevate the risks of deflation as broadly defined.  The BOT has developed the 
Combined Deflation Risk Index (CDRI)  as a tool for evaluating  the probability of  deflation 
risks in Thailand.  In developing  the index, the BOT integrated  the concepts for index 
construction used by the ECB and the IMF2/. The index calculation  is based on different risk 
factors that could give rise to the kind of deflation which  undermine s economic and financial 
stability. Th ere are a total of 15 variables  divided into 5 categories as follows:  
(1) Costs and prices  includ ing changes in price of goods and services,  producer price 
index, real wages, and GDP deflator. The broadness and persistence of the decline of prices 
are taken into account.  
(2) Inflation expectation  is measured by the difference between current inflation an d 
inflation expectation 12 -month ahead. A significant fall in inflation expectation reflects   
the unanchoring of  public inflation expectation, which encourage households to delay 
consumption in anticipation of lower prices,  thereby reducing  current business earnings.   
(3) Excess capacity  includ ing the output gap and the average real GDP growth in the 
medium term relative to the long term. If there is large excess capacity,  there will be little 
incentive to invest.  
(4) Asset  prices  and exchange rate  includ ing changes in the stock exchange index 
and the  real effective exchange rate  (REER ). A fall in asset prices suggests declining wealth, 
while a rise in the REER reflects lower competitiveness, affecting  exports revenue.  
(5) Financial factors includ ing credit and money supply growth . Slow growth of credit 
and money supply point to sluggish economic activities.  
Each  variable is  assessed  against a  criteria.3/ A score of 1 is given to a variable that 
meets the criteria, and a score of  0 otherwise . The unweighted average4/ is then multiplied by 
100 to obtain an index with a possible value ranging from 0 to 100, with the value of 50 and  
                                         
2/ For more details on conceptual frameworks, see Norges  Bank  (2014)  Deflation  Indicator  for the Euro Area,  
Economic  Commentaries  No.1/2014, and  Decressin,  J., and Douglas  L. (2009)  Gauging  Risks  for Deflation,  
IMF Staff Position  Note.  SPN/09/01.  
3/ Criteria used are drawn from an IMF study (2009), which evaluated the experience s of countries that faced 
or are facing deflation problem .  
4/ The index calculat ion based on an unweighted average may fail to capture the varying importance of each 
variable. However, when calculating a weighted average, quite a lot of detailed data are r equired to 
determine the appropriate weights for different variables. Further studies will be conducted for this purpose. 
Nonetheless, in using the current index, the BOT uses discretion in interpreting the calculated average 
index, attaching greater impor tance to some variables that contribute significantly to deflation risks, such as 
public inflation expectations.   Monetary Policy Report June 2015  41 higher  indicating  high probability of 
deflation.  To test whether the index 
can accurately captures risk of deflation  
in practice,  the index for Japan over 
the 2009 -2012 period, where the 
Japanese economy was in deflation, 
was calculated.  The index had a 
value greater than 50, with almost all 
categories  of factors  signifying  higher 
deflation risks (Chart 1) . 
In the case of Thailand, t he 
index suggests that the probability 
of deflation  in Thailand  in 2015 is 
low. The index edged up in 2015 
from lower energy and raw food 
prices , causing  negative headline 
inflation. However, our assessment 
of the horizon  until the end o f the 
year points to lower probability of 
deflation (Chart 2)  in line with higher 
costs . The effects of the high base of 
oil prices  will gradually subside , while 
global oil prices  is expected to rise 
somewhat in the second half of this 
year.  In the meantime, d omestic raw 
food prices are projected to pick up after th e oversupply of meat and eggs begin s to abate . 
Demand -side inflationary pressure is also projected to slowly i ncrease as the economy 
recovers.  Nonetheless , slower - or weaker -than-expected economic recovery could contribute 
to higher deflation risks ahead.  Hence,  the MPC continues to closely monitor Thailand’s 
economic and financial developments, in particular those  factors affecting private consumption  
includ ing income, wages and employment, as well as  consumer and business  confidence.

meetings . Money market rates fell immediately 
after the policy decisions, while government bond 
yields fell only initially before rising  afterwards   
in tandem with global financial markets .    
Money and bond markets  
Monetary conditions eased after two 
reductions in policy interest rate on  March 11  
and April 29, 2015. Money market rates dropped 
immediately following both reductions  (Chart 3.1).   
Similarly  the yields on short -term government bonds  Policy interest rate reductions at the March and April 2015 meetings led 
to more accommodative monetary conditions, with lower money market rates and 
commercial banks’ lending rates. The baht weakened following the MPC rate 
decisions and the announcement of  BOT’s measures on  capital flows relaxation 
under Capital Account Liberalization Master Plan, and the expectation of the 
imminent Fed’s rate hike. Meanwhile,  bank  credits showed sign s of modest 
improvement.  
Financial positions of households and businesses, particularly small 
businesses, were adversely affected by slow economic recovery, leading to the 
deterioration in loan repayment abilities. Excess supply in real estate rose slightl y 
due to stagnant purchasing power. Looking ahead economic recovery and 
accommodative monetary conditions, should contribute to healthier  financial 
standings of households and businesses.  Commercial banks maintained strict 
lending standards in the face of rising NPLs. Nevertheless, sufficient levels of 
loan loss provision and capital base should help maintain  banking sector  stability 
amid  a decline in loan quality.

decision s, weake r economic momentum, as well as 
persistently subdued inflation  (Chart 3.2).   
In May 2015, h owever, yields on government  
bonds of medium to long maturit ies rose rapidly 
(Chart 3.2),  in line with other regional bond yields   
(Chart  3.3), following  comment s by the Fed’s 
Chairwoman on possible overvaluation of the U.S. 
equities and treasury bonds. The remark immediately  
triggered sell -offs of  assets across  emerging market s. 
In sum, government bond  yields up to the  5-year 
sector declin ed, whereas those of long er maturities 
increased  from the pre-March 11, 2015 meeting  
levels (Chart 3.4).  As a result, funding cost s of  
short -term corporate bonds fell steadily , unlike that 
of medium to long -term ones , which edged up from 
the previous quarter  (Chart 3.5).   
Equity market  
The equity market became less overheated  
compared to  the previous quarter , due to government  
measures t o curb speculation  as well as sluggish 
economic growth . Although valuations of small -
capitalization stocks remained elevated compared 
to historical average,  risk to f inancial  stability was 
deemed limited.    
Compared to  the first quarter , activities in 
the equity market became less overheated during 
the first two months of the second quarter , in line 
with sluggish economic activity . The Stock Exch ange  
of Thailand (SET) index remained  steady , while 
the Market for Alternative Investment (MAI) index 
fell. In April and May 2015, retail investors were 
net sellers in the SET market (Chart 3.6) , and 
they also reduced  new purchases in the MAI 
(Chart 3.7) . On the other hand, foreign investors, 
who were net sellers in the first quarter , became  
net buyers in the SET during  the second quarter .

Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and 
Stock Exchange Thailand (SET),  including  Trading 
Alert List and Turnover List, helped curb the 
overheating  of the market, as indicated by the 
continued decline in Price - Earnings (P/E) Ratio 
(Chart 3.8) . 
Despite these measures, the underpricing 
of risks among investors could pose a threat to 
financial stability . The Forward Price -Earnings 
(Forward P/E) Ratio1/ remained substantially above  
historical average s especially in the MAI (Table 
3.1), although it had moderated compared to the 
end of 2014. Because stocks  with high P/E ratio 
were mostly small -capitalization stocks, their total 
market capitalization was not large. More over, 
trading is  funded mostly by  cash, with low level s of 
margin loan. Therefore, these development posed 
limited risk s to the overall financial stability .   
 
  
 
 
It is worth noting that domestic institutional 
investors and mutual funds were net buyers in the 
SET throughout the first half of this year. This can 
be explained in part by the welcom e development 
of more efficient asset management by the general  
public. But th is was likely also a result of  growing 
search for yield b ehavior amid the prolonged

per share.

Foreign exchange market  
The Thai baht against  U.S. dollar  exchange  
rate stabilize d in April 2015, before weakening 
steadily  starting from  the end of the month (Chart 
3.9) as a result of  the unexpected rate reduction 
on April 29, 2015. The ensuing announcement of 
BOT’s measures on  capital flows relaxation on 
April 30, 2015 also cont ribute d to the continued 
weakening of the baht.  
In May, asset sell -offs by non -residents 
across  emerging economies, including Thailand, 
led to massive net outflows from the bond 
market. As a result, the baht depreciated further  
against U.S. dollar, closing at 33.66 baht per 
U.S. dollar on June 10, 2015, a 3.3 percent  
depreciation from the end of the first quarter .  
Also, the baht volatility surged compared to 
those of regional currencies during th e same  
period (Chart 3.10) .   
Depreciation of the baht against major and 
most regional currencies led to a decline in 
Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) and 
Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) in May 
2015.  In particular, t he NEER fell by 2.8 percent  
from the last quarter (Chart 3. 11)

Following  the monetary policy easing in 
March and April 2015, private  sector’s funding  
costs and returns on deposits declined. Commercial  
banks’ benchmark loan rate s and deposit rates 
dropped , although the degree to wh ich loan rates  
responded  to the policy rate cut  on April 29, 2015 
was more limited and slower than past average s. 
Meanwhile , credit expansion  showed signs of 
some improvements. On the other hand, deposit  
growth  continued to be subdued  as ample  liquidity 
amongst financial institutions reduced the competition  
for deposits.  
Interest rates, credits, and deposits  
Funding costs of commercial bank loans  
declined following lower policy interest rate, 
especially after the March 11, 2015  decision . The 
majority of commercial banks reduced their 
Minimum Lending Rate s (MLR) within the two weeks 
following the policy decision, although other 
benchmark rates, including Minimum Retail Rate 
(MRR), were kept constant (Table 3.2).  Actual 
funding cost s, however, would depend on each loan  
applicant’s credit risk  while  commercial banks 
tighten their lending standards for both business and 
household .    
The degree with which  loan rates followed  
lower policy rate  at the April 29, 2015 meeting was 
relatively slow and limited only to a few large 
commercial bank s. This was because most banks 
were concerned over the outlook  of bank earnings  
amid weaker -than-expected economic prospect  and 
rising NPLs. More recently, however, the lending 
rates to creditworthy retail bor rowers  (MRR) , offered 
by some large commercial banks, have been 
adjusted lower in line with the policy rate reduction s. 48    Monetary Policy Report  June 2015    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Meanwhile, commercial banks reduced their 
deposit rates in line with the fall in the policy rate 
(Chart 3.12). The reduction  was also partly  driven by  
ample liquidity among banks  stemming from 
sluggish demand  for credits . A more detailed look 
revealed  that most banks cut  the interest  rates  on 
fixed deposit and spec ial deposit products, while 
leaving those on current deposit and  savings 
accounts  unchanged , both of which constitute  the 
majority  of total deposits.  
Private credit  growth a ccelerated slightly  
in 2015 Q1, up to 5.4 percent from 4.5 percent in  
the last quarter of 2014 (Chart 3.13).  Signs of 
improvements in credit issuance became evident for 
both household and business, although growth  in 
business loans  was limited to just a few sectors  
(Chart 3.14) .

institutions2/ grew  from 2014 Q4. However, new 
loan issuance was largely working capital loans, 
whereas fixed assets loans continued to slow in 
line with weak private investment. New issuances 
were also concentrated in a few business sectors, 
likely a result of transitory factors. For example,  
anticipated rise in the excise tax  brought forward 
production and  hence accelerated  credit  demands  
by the food and beverages industry in February. 
With regards to the capital markets, b usinesses 
obtained more fund ing via the bond market 
compared  to the previous quarter (Chart 3.15) . 
The fall in short -term yields following policy rate 
cuts in March and April 2015 spurred the corporate  
bond issuance in the 1-3 year sector . Similarly , 
equity issuances rose sharply  in March 2015,  
led by construction  materials, real estate, and 
transportation  sectors . 
New issuance of household credits also 
expanded  somewhat compared to the last quarter 
of 2014, driven partly by credits that Specialized 
Financial Institutions extended to village funds and 
farmers under  the Ministry of Finance’s initiative s. 
But given  subdued  economic recovery and 
uncertainty over future income , consumers 
remained cautious with regards to their spending. 
Thus, there is great uncertainty over the degree 
which  consumption spending will ben efit from 
these new credits. Meanwhile, household credit 
approval rate dropped from  the previous quarter

standards.  
Looking ahead, the latest Senior Loan 
Officers’ Survey indicate s that demand for 
business credit s will pick up slightly . Most of the 
increased demand is for  working capital in sectors 
that mainly produce  for the domestic market , as 
well as tourism -related industries , such as food 
and beverages, hotel s and restaurants, and 
wholesale and ret ail trade. Household credits are 
also expected  to grow, especially those for o ther 
consumption categor ies. Nevertheless, given the 
concerns over weak economic prospect s and 
worsening credit qualit y, financial institutions will 
likely remain cautious in lending.  
Since 2014 Q4,  the liquidity  position  of 
commercial banks has increased , as indicated by 
loan to deposit (including  bills of exchange (B/E) ) 
ratio falling from 98.3 percent in June 2014 to 94.5 
percent at the end of April 2015 (Chart 3.16)3/. 
That, coupled with slower -than-expected economic  
recovery, led to a decline in competition for deposits  
among banks , resulting in lower  interest rates on 
special deposit products . As a result,  the amount 
of new deposits shrank in 2015 Q1 and in April 
(Chart 3.17) . Yet deposits and bills of exchange 
(B/E) for other depository institutions rose by 5.8 
percent from the same period last year, and by 4.0

Earnin gs and stability of financial institution  
system  remained resilient , although loan quality 
deteriorated somewhat from the end of 2014  
due to  the slow economic recovery.  Nevertheless, 
commercial banks have  maintained  high level of 
loan loss provisio n and capital  base  that would  
serve as  cush ion against economic uncertainties .  
Overall loan quality worsened, reflected  by 
the delinquency and NPL R atio (those loans with  
more than one month overdue)  that climbing to 6.0 
percent (Chart 3.19).  Worsening loan quality were  
detected among the  SME credits and all types of 
consumer credits (Table 3.3).  Nonetheless , sound 
risk management and high level of provision have 
continued to ensure the stability of financial 
institutions. The ratio of Actual to Regulatory Loan 
Loss Provision Ratio stood at 165.9 percent, while 
Capital Adequacy Ratio was at 16.6 percent, both 
indicating strong financial position which should be 
able to absorb  shocks from deteriorating  loan 
quality.  
3.3 Non-financial s ectors  
Household sector  
Sluggish economic recovery resulted in 
lower household income , thus weakening household  
financial position s. Therefore, consumers  have 
become more guarded  with respect to spending 
and incurring new debts. More cautious lending 
standard by financial institutions also contributed 
to the slowdown in household debt  accumulation . 
Furthermore , repayment ability among households 
with high debt outstanding was negatively  impacted  
by the weak economy, reflect ed by the ris ing

consumer loans . 
Weak economic recovery , coupled with  
prospects of falling income , caused households to 
be cautious in spending and incurring new debts. 
Household credits, therefore, dropped from 7.7 
percent at the end of 2014 Q3 to 6.5 percent at  
the end of 2014. With household debt grew faster 
than GDP  growth , household debt -to-GDP rat io, 
therefore,  continued to edge up to  85.9 percent at 
the end of 2014 (Chart 3.20).  
Slow economic recovery also lowered 
household  income and undermined consumer 
confidence. Income in the agricultural sector 
continued to contract following the downward 
trend in prices of agricultural  products . Similarly, 
non-agricultural  income (wages including  overtime 
pay) dropped  slightly (Chart 3.21) . Taken together,  
repayment ability of households declined, indicated  
by rising NPLs and delinquency ratio s (share of 
loans overdue by over 1 month)  which grew from 
5.9 percent at the end of 2014 to 6.1 percent at 
the end of 2015 Q1 (Table 3.3) . Overa ll, the 
decline in quality  of personal  loans and credit card 
loans , has been observed  across all income groups.  
In the coming months , the MPC will 
continue to closely monitor the impacts of 
economic activity  on household income and 
repayment ability, particularly among the low-
income and agricultural households whose debt 
burden s are more elevated compared to others .

Earnings of corporate sector declined 
slightly from the previous quarter. Moreover, 
financial standing of household s and businesses, 
especially  small businesses , were affected by 
slow economic recovery, causing a decline in 
repayment ability.   
In 2015 Q1, earnings of listed companies 
showed signs of slowing down  from the previous 
quarter, indicated by a decline in the Return on 
Asset ratio (ROA)  (Chart 3.22) . In the real estate  
sector , sluggish economic recovery led to lower  
sales , while firms incurred surges in marketing 
and operational expenses. As a result, Net Profit 
Margin (NPM)  for the real estate sector  fell. (Chart 
3.23) . Likewise , construction firms have not benefit ed 
significantly from government’s infrastructure 
investment . Mean while , the petroleum sector 
continued to be undermined  by the subdued 
global crude oil prices, resulting in the decline of 
the Asset Turnover Ratio (ATO) (Chart 3.24) .  
Nevertheless, their earnings were partly improved 
from the fact that stock losses and asset impairments  
had been realised  in the previous accounting 
periods.  On the other hand, growing tourism  sector  
benefited hotels and restaurants, as  well as 
transportation industries , particularly  the airline  
industry . Declining oil price s also boosted  the 
earnings of transportation group .  
Despite these  developments, risks to the 
stability of the corporate sector remain low , 
evidenced by the  stable Debt -to-Equity ratio 
(Chart 3.25) . Overall the repayment ability fell 
slightly, indicated by a small drop in Interest 
Coverage Ratio (ICR), but at levels still considered 
robust (Chart 3.26) . A closer look at firms across  
different sizes  (5 groups classified by sizes) ,

companies maintained high repayment ability, with 
high ICR (Chart 3.27) . On the other hand,  the 
smallest  firm group  exhibited sharp declines  in 
ICR, signaling potential liquidity risks . If the se 
small listed firms are taken  to reflect the situations 
of the non-listed  firms which tend to be  small and 
medium sized firms , this may indicate the worsening  
liquidity positions and lower repayment ability of 
SMEs as a result of the lethargic economy  as well . 
Thus, the MPC will  continue to  close ly monitor this 
issue going forward (Table 3.3 ). 
Real estate sector  
Excess supply  in the real estate  sector 
continued to rise, particularly for condominium s, 
as consumer  purchasing power was adversely 
affected  by slow economic growth and banks’ 
cautious  stance towards new  issuance  of mortgage  
loans . Nevertheless, the real estate sector, which 
is dominated by large firms, possessed solid 
financial position and continued to adapt to the 
changing business conditions. Thus, the sector is 
likely to pose lim ited stability risk to overall  
financial system  at the moment .   
Demand in real estate market slowed 
markedly over the first five months of 2015, as  
a result of weak economic recovery, subdued 
household income s, persistently elevated level of 
household debt, and more stringent  lending  
standards applied  to the sector by financial 
institutions. As such, most real estate firms 
postponed new project launches, although on 
balance the number of project launches rose 
because some large firms decided to relaunch 
shelved projects in April  (Chart 3.28).  The majority 
of these new projects were condominiums along 
mass transit rail routes, for which developers

Furthermore, a number of firms repositioned 
themselves towards the middle to high -income 
consumers , whose  purchasing power  remaining 
relatively unaffected (Chart 3.29) . Nevertheless, 
supply of new units still exceeded  demand. The 
reservation rate of new residential units declined 
furthe r to 20.9 percent in April 2015 from the end of 
2014, well below the 2004 -2014 average of 37.5 
percent. Excess supp ly of real estate  units, therefore,  
was expected to rise in the coming months . 
However,  since most real estate firms 
maintained solid f inancial standing, the risks to  
overall economic and financial stability of  the 
slowdown in the sector should be limited . 
Retained Earnings to Total Assets Ratio  (Chart 
3.30)  and Interest Coverage Ratio (Chart 3.31)  of 
the sector still indicated robust health. Moreover, 
the quality of pre -finance (Chart 3.32)  and post -
finance loans declined  only marginally , while 
banks remained ca utious with respect to lending. 
Ample levels of Allowance for Doubtful Account  
and capital base should sufficiently  deal with the 
risk of deteriorating loan qualit y.    
Fiscal sector  
Stability of the fiscal sector continued to be 
robust overall. Treasury cash balance was sufficient  
to buffer  the impact of lower -than-projected tax 
revenue collection. Moreover, the current level of 
public  debt remained low and does not pose threat 
to stability . Nevertheless, the level of public debt is 
likely to rise over the coming months as a result of 
transfers of debt incurred by Specialized Financial 
Institutions’ quasi -fiscal activities, as well as other 
outstanding debt that the  government owes to 
various funds and public enterprises . The fiscalization  
of such debt will raise public debt burden and thus

monitored going forward.  
The outlook for fiscal sector remained 
stable , as reflected by  a number of indicators.  (1) 
Treasury budget balance had increased and was  
sufficient to meet necessary demand of liquidity as 
well as offset the projected shortfall of revenue 
collection  this year,  marking two consecutive 
years of  revenue shortfall  in line with economic 
slowdown . Treasury budget balance at the end of 
April 2015 stood at 126 b illion baht, up from 116 
billion baht in January 2015. The increase was  a 
result of the fact that the government had 
borrowed more than needed to cover for monthly 
budget deficit s. (2) The ratio of public debt to 
GDP*/ grew slightly, but remained well below 
the fiscal sustainability threshold of 60 percent . 
In March 2015, the ratio recorded at 43.3 percent, 
up from 42.8 percent in December 2014 (Chart 
3.33).  New borrowings  that covered for  budget 
deficit s and those prov isioned for the restructuring 
of debt due on May 22, 2015 contributed to the 
increase  in the public debt to GDP ratio . 
Going forward, a major risk factor that 
requires close  monitoring is the potentia l surge in  
public debt  follow ing the debt transfer plan . First, 
debts incurred by SFIs for quasi -fiscal measures  
will be transferred to the government. M oreover, 
further outstanding debt burden includes the  
amounts  that the government owes to various 
funds and public enterprises , such as  rice su bsidy 
                                                        
*/ Debt -to-GDP ratio  is disseminated by the Public Debt 
Management Office of the Ministry of Finance.  The 
current series is constructed using the new chained 
volume measure GDP , publicized on May 18, 2015. The 
ratios in this series are significantly smaller than those 
constructed using the former GDP series (with fixed
