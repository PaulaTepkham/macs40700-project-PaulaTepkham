Monetary Policy Report  
 
 
The Monetary Policy Report  is prepared quarterly by staff of the 
Bank of Thailand with the approval of the Monetary Policy Committee 
(MPC ). It serves two purposes : (1) to communicate to the public the MPC ’s 
consideration and ratio nales for the conduct of monetary policy, and (2) to

Monetary Policy in Thailand  
Monetary Policy Committee  
Under the B ank of Thailand Act, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC ) comprises the governor 
and two deputy governors, as well as four distinguished external members representing various 
sectors of the economy, with the aim of ensuring  that monetary policy decisions ar e effective and 
transparent . 
Monetary Policy Objective   
The MPC implements monetary policy under the flexible inflation targeting regime . While regarding  
medium -term price stability as its primary objective, the MPC also aims at supporting sustainable ,  
full-potential economic growth and preserving financial stability, attributing to long -term price stability  
and economic sustainability  
Monetary Policy Target  
On December  22, 2020, the Cabinet approved the monetary policy target for 2021, which was 
mutually agreed between the MPC and the Minister of Finance to set the headline inflation  within 
the range of 1 –3 percent as the target for the medium -term horizon and for 2021 . 
In the event that average headline inflation in the past 12 months or a forecast of ave rage 
headline inflation over 12 months ahead breaches the target range, the MPC shall  send an open 
letter to the Minister of Finance to explain  reasons  for the breach of the target range,  together 
with measures taken and estimated time to bring inflation b ack to the target . In addition, the MPC 
will write an additional open letter to the Minister of Finance every six months if average headline 
inflation based on the above criteria remains outside the target range . 
Monetary Policy Instrument  
The MPC utilize s the 1 -day bilateral repurchase transaction rate as the policy interest rate to signal  
the monetary policy stance . 
Evaluation of Economic Conditions and Forecasts  
The Bank of Thailand takes into account information from all sources, the macroeconomic mod el, 
data from each economic sector, as well as surveys  of large enterprises, together with  small and 
medium -sized enterprises from all over the country, and various financial institutions  to ensure that 
economic evaluations and forecasts are accurate and c over all aspects, both at the macro and 
micro levels . 
Monetary Policy Communication  
Recognizing the importance of monetary policy communication to the public, the MPC employs  
various  channels of communication, both in Thai and English, such as (1) organiz ing a press statement  
at 14 :00 on the day of the Committee meeting, (2) publishing edited minutes of the MPC meeting two 
weeks after the meeting, and (3) publishing the Monetary Policy Report  every quarter

Monetary Policy Report   June  2021   5  
Monetary Policy Conduct in the Second Quarter of 2021  
At the meetings on May 5 and June 23, 2021, the Committee voted unanimously to maintain the 
policy rate at 0 .50 percent . The Committee assessed that Thailand ’s economic recovery would 
be slower and more uneven compared with  the previous assessment . The Thai economy was 
projected to expand by 1 .8 in 2021 and 3 .9 percent in 2022 . The third-wave  outbreak  would affect 
the recov ery in foreign tourist figures and domestic demand . Labor markets became more fragile and 
might pick up more slowly than in the past, especially the services sector and among the self -employed . 
Additional fiscal support and strong merchandise export growth  would only partially offset the impact of 
the third -wave  outbreak . Headline inflation rose temporarily in the second quarter of 2021 due mainly to  
supply -side factors . Meanwhile, rising inflation in advanced economies and supply constraints -including 
the shortage s of manufacturing inputs as well as higher costs of transportation and raw material -would 
have limited passthrough to domestic inflation . Medium -term inflation expectations remained well -
anchored within the target range .  
Key assumptions underpinn ing the latest economic forecasts were as follows . First, the third -
wave outbreak would be well contained by the beginning the fourth quarter of 2021 . Second, at least 
100 million vaccine doses would be procured and distributed within 2021 as planned, lead ing to the 
attainment  of herd immunity by the first half of 2022 . Third, additional fiscal stimulus would be 
forthcoming under the new Emergency Decree that authorized  500 billion baht of government 
borrowing . However, the Thai economic outlook would still  face significant uncertainties and 
downside risks,  including  (1) prolonged outbreaks and virus mutations, both the existing and new 
variants, (2) smaller -than-expected government spending on economic relief and restoration, (3) further 
deterioration in bu siness balance sheets from the new wave, especially those in the services sector, 
leading to widespread business closures and lay -offs, and (4) higher -than-expected impact of supply 
disruptions and higher shipping costs on Thailand ’s manufacturing and expo rt sectors .  
The Committee viewed that the most important issue facing the Thai economy at the present 
was the procurement and distribution of appropriate vaccines in an adequate and timely manner . 
Financial measures should be expedited,  particularly the s pecial loan facility and debt restructuring . 
These would provide more targeted assistance to the affected businesses and households than cutting 
the policy rate . The policy rate was already at a low level and cutting it might not lend much support to 
the e conomic recovery . The Committee thus voted to maintain the policy rate and would stand ready to 
use the limited policy space at the most effective timing . The Committee also viewed that all parties 
should swiftly push forward the implementation of various measures to support the economy, especially 
over the next six months where uncertainties would remain high . 
Assessment of the Economic and Financial Outlook as the Basis for Policy Formulation  
1. Global Economy  
The global economy continued to recover  on th e back of im proving private consumption and services  
sector, especially in the U .S. after containment measures were relaxed and financial aids were granted 
to the low -income . Meanwhile, Asian exports exhibited strong growth . Looking ahead, Thailand ’s tradi ng 
partner economies would continue to recover thanks to the abatement of the outbreak, the progress of 
vaccine distribution in many countries, as well as the additional fiscal stimulus measures and accomodative  
monetary policies supportive of the recovery . The Committee expected trading partner economies to 
expand 6 .0 percent in 2021 and 4 .1 percent in 2022 . Nonetheless, downside risks to trading partners ’ 
growth increased . New waves of infections and virus mutations could prompt governments to 
tighten con tainment measures again  and could also reduce vaccine efficacy . This would delay herd Executive Summary   
 
Monetary Policy Report   June  2021   6 immunity attainment  in each country and undermine consumer confidence . In addition, the global 
shortage s of manufacturing inputs could be more severe and more protracted than expected . 
Governments worldwide continued to implement monetary and fiscal measures  to alleviate the impacts  
of the pandemic . The U .S. government announced measures to rebuild the U .S. economy over the 
longer term, namely, the 2 .25 trillion U .S. dollars American Jobs Plan and the 1.8 trillion U .S. dollars 
American Families Plan . Central banks around the world continued to maintain accommodative 
monetary policy stances by keeping policy rates low and conducting quantitative easing . Nevertheless, 
the Fed eral Reserve and the Bank of England signaled potential shifts in monetary policy stances if 
economic growth remained robust and inflation returned to the target sustainably . Global financial 
conditions could therefore start  tightening in the period ahead .  
2. Financial Conditions and Financial Stability  
Overall financial conditions in Thailand remained accommodative . Short -term interest rates in financial  
markets remained at low levels consistent with the policy rate . Medium - and long -term Thai government 
bond yields fell in tandem with the long -term U .S. treasury bond yields and higher  foreign investors ’ 
demand for Thai government bonds . However, the new Emergency Decree authorizing 500 billion baht 
of government borrowing led to a slight increase in the l ong-term government bond yields due to an 
anticipation of  greater  bond supply . Benchmark lending rates of commercial banks remained low and 
new loan rates (NLR) declined particularly for larger -sized loans . On exchange rates, the baht against 
the U .S. dollar and the effective exchange rate continued to depreciate from the previous quarter due to 
(1) the third-wave outbreak  in Thailand and (2) the stronger U .S. dollar driven by the signaling of the 
Federal Reserve of potential faster -than-expected policy rat e hikes . Nevertheless, the Committee would 
continue to closely monitor developments in the foreign exchange market and capital flows, while 
continuously expedite the new foreign exchange ecosystem in Thailand .  
The Thai financial system remained vulnerable  due to the impact of the third -wave  outbreak  that 
delayed the recovery and increased uncertainties . Weak balance sheets and debt servicing 
capabilities of households and businesse s were exacerbated by the third -wave  outbreak . In the period 
ahead, risks po sed by  the highly uncertain recovery and the pandemic would remain . Households and 
businesses  would therefore need continued support from fiscal and financial measures to alleviate the 
impacts . Their balance  sheets and debt servicing capabilities warranted  close mon itoring, especially 
during the phase -outs of support measures . 
3. Economic and Inflation Outlook  
The Thai economy was projected to expand 1.8 percent in 2021  due to the more prolonged and 
severe third -wave  outbreak  that affected domestic spending  and foreign tourist figures . Nevertheless, 
additional fiscal stimulus from the new Emergency Decree, clearer plans for vaccine procurement and 
distribution, as well as strong merchandise export growth on the back of trading partners ’ economies 
would help the Thai economy to avoid a sharp slowdown . Growth would pick up and expand 3.9 
percent in 2022  underpinned by continuing support from government measures . Furthermore, herd 
immunity in Thailand was expected to be achieved within the first half of 2022 , facilitating a gradual 
resumption in economic activities and increasing foreign tourist admissions in 2022.  
Merchandise export value was expected to post solid gain at 17.3 percent in 2021  and 4.9 percent 
in 2022  following much stronger -than-expected outtur ns in the first quarter of 2021. Looking ahead, 
merchandise exports would see robust expansion in tandem with trading partners ’ economic growth . 
However, global supply constraints such as the shortage of freight containers, higher costs of transportation  
and raw materials, and the shortage of electronic components could have some impact s on Thai 
merchandise  exports going forward . 
Exports of services would continue contracting and slowly recover . Foreign tourist figures were 
revised down to 0.7 million in 2021 and 10 million in 2022. This was on account of the new wave of the  
 
Monetary Policy Report   June  2021   7 COVID -19 outbreak and virus mutations abroad and in Thailand, which prompted some countries to 
maintain international travel restrictions . Thailand would also be unable to relax quaranti ne requirements 
for travelers arriving from abroad .  
The current account balance would record a deficit  of 1.5 billion U .S. dollars  in 2021  due to lower 
foreign tourist figures, as well as higher transport costs and oil prices . For 2022 , the current accoun t 
surplus would be smaller than the previous assessment,  recording 12 billion U .S. dollars due in line 
with a decline in tourism receipts due to  lower foreign tourist figures .  
Private consumption would gradually recover in the latter half of 2021.  Despite  being restrained in  
the first half of 2021 from the new outbreak and more stringent containment measures, private consumption  
was expected to gradually recover in the second half of the year  thanks to additional government relief 
and stimulus measures . Progress in vaccine distribution would partly contribute to improving consumer 
confidence, leading to a recovery in tourism and services sector spending in  2022.   
Private investment recovery would be sustained , growing 7.0 percent in 2021  and 6.0 percent in  
2022  in line with the stronger export growth . The third-wave outbreak  held back private investment 
somewhat during the first half of 2021  with investments in large infrastructure projects declining slightly . 
Despite that, private investment would pick up in the second half of 2021  driven by strong export growth 
and gradual upturn in private consumption .  
The risks of the Thai economic outlook underperforming the baseline projection would  be 
significant . First, protracted outbreaks and virus mutations from  both the existing  and new variants 
could reduce vaccine efficacy while prolonging and intensifying the pandemic . These could lead to a 
public health crisis, affect domestic spending and delay  the re -opening plan to admit foreign tourists . 
Second, governmen t spending on economic relief and restoration could be lower  than expected if the 
projects under the new Emergency Decree faced approval delays or low disbursement rates . Third, 
balance sheets of businesses  could be exacerbated by the new outbreak, especia lly those in the 
services sector  leading to widespread business closures and lay -offs. Dismissed workers could be 
unemployed for extended periods and eventually give up finding jobs . Further deterioration in business 
and household balance sheets would thus  impinge on economic activities and cause a rise in debt 
defaults . Fourth, supply disruption and higher shipping costs may have more impacts on Thailand ’s 
manufacturing and export sectors than expected .  
Headline inflation was projected to be 1.2 percent i n both 2021 and 2022.  For 2021 , inflationary 
pressure would rise on account of supply -side factors . Energy prices increased in tandem with the rise 
in global crude oil prices, although the government measure to reduce electricity bills temporarily eased 
some of the price pressures . For 2022 , headline inflation would be higher than previously assessed as 
the effects of measures to reduce electricity bills dissipate . Headline inflation would remain within the 
target range throughout the forecast horizon . Core  inflation was revised down to 0.2 percent in 2021 and 
0.3 percent in 2022 given that demand -pull inflationary pressure would be subdued and recover more 
slowly following recurring outbreaks . 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
Monetary Policy Report   June  2021   8 1. The Global Economy  
The global economy continued to rec over, driven by improving  private consumption and 
services sector, especially in the U .S. where COVID -19 containment measures were 
relaxed and financial aids were granted to the low -income . The global economic 
recovery was also driven in part by strong exp orts growth in Asia where the impact of the 
new waves of outbreak  were still limited . However, the economic outlook of Thailand ’s 
trading partners faced higher risks stemming from the new outbreak and virus mutations, 
as well as potentially severe and prol onged  supply disruption .   
In the first quarter of 2021, economic recoveries among advanced economies  
diverged . The U .S. economy registered stronger -than-expected growth driven mainly by 
private consumption . This was partly due  to the relaxation of contai nment measures after 
vaccination became more widespread and the 1,400 U .S. dollar stimulus checks  paid to  the 
low-income . Meanwhile, the euro area and Japan continued to contract as the resurgence of 
COVID -19 cases prompted the governments to tighten conta inment measures, affecting  the 
recovery of  domestic demand . 
Looking ahead, the growth of 
advanced economies would  improve  
especially for the U .S and the euro area, 
underpinned by strong private consumption  
and the resumption of services sector  
activitie s (Chart 1 .1). Containment measures 
were gradually relaxed  following  declines  
in new COVID -19 cases and higher  
vaccination rates . The improved outlook was 
also attributed to better exports in tandem 
with the global economic recovery . Meanwhile,  
the Japanes e economy faced challenges 
from the  new severe  wave of COVID -19 
outbreak  that prompted the extension of 
containment measures through to the end 
of the second quarter . This would continue 
to weigh on the already subdued private 
consumption despite benefits from strong 
export growth in line with global demand . 
The shortage of semiconductors would 
likely intensify due to production constraints  
with output being insufficient to meet surgin g 
demand . Semiconductor shortage  would 
also be exacerbated by freight con tainer 
shortage  resulting in longer transport times . 
Nevertheless, it was expected that the shortage of semiconductor would mainly impact 
automobile production  (Chart 1 .2) and could possibly last until the end of 2021 .

Monetary Policy Report   June  2021   9 China and other Asian economies woul d continue to expand on the back of strong 
export growth . The new wave of COVID -19 outbreak in Asia became more widespread 
but would primarily affect services sector activities . 
The Chinese economy exhibited  strong growth in the first quarter of 2021  
driven by continued expansion of domestic demand in line with  the improving outbreak 
situation, although growth had slowed down somewhat following the acceleration in 
manufacturing and construction activities 
in the earlier period  (Chart 1 .3). Looking 
ahead, t he Chinese economy would 
continue to expand thanks to strong 
export growth in line with  the global 
economic recovery . This would benefit 
the manufacturing sector and domestic 
demand, enabling a strong expansion 
exceeding pre -pandemic levels . Anothe r 
suppor ting factor underpinning China ’s 
economic outlook was  quickly rising 
vaccination rates as a result of government 
incentives to encourage residents to 
get vaccinated .  
Asian economies (excluding Japan and China ) continued to expand in the first 
quarter  of 2021 driven mainly by strong exports growth especially electronic products and 
biomedical equipment s, in line with a continued recovery in global demand (Chart 1 .4). 
However, private consumption in many Asian countries were affected by more -prolonged -
than-expected measures to contain the new outbreak . In the period ahead, Asian economies 
would continue expand on the back of strong export growth, especially exports to the U .S., 
Europe, and China . Meanwhile, consumption was expected to recover at a gradua l pace 
given that the number of COVID -19 cases remained high in some countries such as Taiwan 
and Malaysia . Infections had prompted governments to tighten containment measures and 
led to the postponement of the Singapore -Hong Kong travel bubble  which would  impact the 
recovery of the services sectors .

Monetary Policy Report   June  2021   10 Governments worldwide continued to implement fiscal measures to alleviate the impact 
of COVID -19 and restore economies after the abatement of the pandemic . 
Governments in many countries deployed additio nal fiscal stimulus to alleviate 
the economic impact of the COVID -19 pandemic . Most of the budgets  were allocated 
toward employment retention, assisting small and medium -sized enterprises (SMEs ), and 
public health . These included the new economic stimulus measures rolled out in Malaysia 
(Pemerkasa Plus, 40 billion ringgits or about 2 .8% of GDP ), Italy (40 billion euros or about 
2.5% of GDP ), France (26 billion euros or about 1 .1% of GDP ), and Korea (14.9 trillion won 
or about 0 .8% of GDP ). Meanwhile, the U .S. government announced measures to rebuild 
the U .S. economy over the longer term  that were focused on infrastructure investment and 
upgrading labor productivity . These measures were the 2 .25 trillion U .S. dollar  American 
Jobs Plan (about 10 .5% of GDP ) and the 1 .8 trillion U .S. dollar  American Families Plan 
(about 8 .4% of GDP ) currently being proposed to the U .S. Congress .   
Central banks in major advanced economies continued to maintain accommodative  
monetary policies, including both low policy rates and q uantitative easing . The 
Federal Reserve (Fed) maintained the purchases of government bonds and mortgage -
backed securities in the amount of at least 120 billion U .S. dollars per month . However, the 
Fed started to signal that it would discuss the appropriate  timing to taper quantitative easing 
if the U .S. economic data continued to indicate robust improvements . The European Central 
Bank (ECB) scaled up bond purchases under the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program 
(PEPP ) in the second quarter of 2021 to further  ease financial conditions . The ECB also 
maintained bond purchases under the Asset Purchase Program (APP) in the amount of  
20 billion euros per month while  keeping its policy rate low . Similarly, the Bank of Japan 
(BOJ) continued to implement Quantitative  and Qualitative Monetary Easing with Yield 
Curve Control . The Bank of England  (BOE ) maintained its policy rate and the asset 
purchase quantity at the meeting on 6 May 2021 but signaled that continued improvements 
in economic indicators and growing inflati on concerns may necessitate monetary tightening . 
Regional central banks maintained accommodative monetary policies , keeping 
policy rates at low levels to support recoveries in the period ahead amid high uncertainties .   
The growth projections for Thailand ’s trading partners were revised up throughout the 
forecast period, but the balance of risks tilted further to the downside .  
Trading partner economies were projected to register higher growth in 2021 
and 2022 compared to the previous Monetary Policy Report . In the first half of 2021, 
pent-up demand turned out higher than expected, especially in the U .S. where 1,400 U .S 
dollar stimulus checks were granted to the low -income . In the euro area, private 
consumption and services sectors activities would recover b etter than expected  in the 
second half of 2021 under the view that the COVID -19 situation in Europe would gradually 
unwind . The acceleration in vaccination progress of many countries and the stronger -than-
expected growth of Asian exports would also provide  additional growth momentum in 2021 . 
For 2022, trading partner economies were projected to post stronger gains than previously 
assessed . This was because the effects of stimulus measures in the U .S. (Build Back Better ) 
were greater than expected and had be nefited exports of various countries, while the euro 
area saw improvements after containment measures were gradually relaxed in 2021 . The  
 
Monetary Policy Report   June  2021   11 Committee thus revised up the projections of trading partners ’ growth to 6 .0 percent 
in 2021 and 4 .1 percent in 2022 (Table 1 .1). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Committee asssessed that the balance of risks to trading partners ’ growth 
tilted further to the downside  due to the following . First, new waves of COVID -19 and virus 
mutations may prompt governments to reinstate lockdowns if the  outbreak could not be 
contained . Mutations might also reduce vaccine efficacy, delay the attainment of herd 
immunity, and  undermine consumer confidence . Second, the global shortage s of 
manufacturing inputs could be more severe and protracted than expected . Third, central 
banks in advanced economies, especially the U .S., could  tighten monetary policy sooner 
than expected, resulting in tighter overall financial conditions . This would exarcebate the 
situation in countries still grappling with the outbreak and  could lead to debt defaults and 
credit rating downgrades . At the same time, trading partner economies could still 
outperform the baseline forecasts if (1) the COVID -19 pandemic subsided and 
vaccination was timelier than expected,  (2) financial and fiscal stimulus measures of various 
countries provided larger -than-expected econ omic boost,  (3) global trade recovered more 
than expected, and (4) international tourism recovered faster than expected, especially for 
advanced economies that were likely to attain h erd immunity relatively sooner .   
In the second quarter of 2021, capital flows beg an returning to emerging market  bonds 
following the decline in U .S. government bond yields . There were some inflows into 
equities in June partly driven by the global economic  recovery, vaccination progress,

Monetary Policy Report   June  2021   12 reflected by the fall in the VIX1/ index between April and May . However, there were continued  
outflows from equities  partly due to concerns over reflation that could prompt the Fed to 
tighten monetary policy sooner, as well as concerns over the new waves of outbreak  in 
many EMs . Nevertheless, the risks of severe EM asset sell -offs due to Fed tapering were 
lower than the Taper Tantrum period in 2013 . This was  because (1) the Fed would likely 
tighten monetary policy at a gradual pace and engage in forward -looking communications to 
minimize impacts on the global financial markets, and (2) the share of foreign investors in 
EM financial assets  continued to declin e over the years . 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In early June, foreign investors continued to increase investment in EM bonds 
and, to some extent, equities . This was due to the global economic recovery, vaccination 
progress in many countries, and accomodative monetary policies  of central banks around 
the world . These factors improved investor  confidence and risk appetite,  reflected by the 
lower VIX index compared to the April -May period .  
Looking ahead, capital flows in EMs would be highly volatile  depending  on 
several factors including, (1) future monetary policy directions of the U .S. and other major 
advanced economies, with investor  concerns growing  after the June 2021 Federal Open 
Market Committee (FOMC ) meeting where  sooner -than-expected monetary policy tightening 
was signa led, (2) the outlook of global recovery and inflation, especially developments in the 
U.S. labor markets, (3) the global COVID -19 vaccination progress, (4) global financial 
vulnerabilities from elevated levels of public and private sector debt leading to h igher 
probabilities of defaults, and (5) re-escalating  U.S.–China trade tensions .

Monetary Policy Report   June  2021   13 In the second quarter of 2021, Dubai crude oil prices rose from the previous three 
months due to the expected pick -up in oil demand in tandem with the global economic 
recovery, as well as the temporary decline in U .S. oil output after cyber -attacks on an  
oil pipeline .   
Dubai crude oil prices rose  from the previous three months in the second 
quarter of 2021 (Chart 1 .6) due to (1) the expected pick -up in oil demand in tand em with 
the global economic recovery  given better -than-expected outturns of  key economic 
indicators in major advanced economies in the first quarter of 2021, together with the 
improving progress of vaccine distribution  in many countries and  the start of  containment 
measures’ easing , and (2) temporary decline in U .S. oil output after a major oil pipeline 
was shut down by cyber -attacks causing short -term disruptions to oil transport .  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Committee revised up Dubai crude oil prices assumptions from 60 .0 to 
62.5 U.S. dollars per barrel in 2021 and from 62 .3 to 65 .5 U.S. dollars in 2022 . The 
upward revision was mainly attributed to the prospects of a better -than-expected global 
economic recovery . However, in the period ahead, crude oil prices would incre ase at a more 
gradual pace due to supply side factors, namely,  (1) the gradual increase in oil output from 
OPEC members and their allies after the end of production cut agreements, (2) higher  
Iranian oil output if the nuclear deal with the U .S. and related  parties could be reached, and 
(3) the gradual increase in U .S. oil output if global oil prices continued to rise .    
Risks to the outlook for Dubai crude oil prices remained balanced . Downside 
risks included  (1) prolonged outbreak of COVID -19 and vaccinat ion delays leading to lower oil 
demand,  (2) re-escalating U .S.–China trade tensions, and (3) the failure of OPEC members 
and their allies to meet production cut agreements, while Iranian oil output might pick up 
sooner and more than expected . Upside risks included  (1) more  severe geopolitical risks in oil 
producing countries such as Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Libya, and (2) the U.S. president ’s policy  
of cutting  fossil fuel subsidies that could raise production costs of U .S. oil producers .

Monetary Policy Report   June  2021   14 2. The Thai Econo my 
2.1 Recent developments  
The Thai economy recovered on the back of strong exports growth in the first quarter of 
2021 . However, the recovery was not as stron g as expected due to the second -wave 
outbreak . Further, the severe and protracted third-wave outb reak would cause the Thai 
economy to slow down in the second quarter of 2021, particularly private consumption .  
The Thai economy contracted 2 .6 percent in the first quarter of 2021, an improvement  
from the 4 .2 percent contraction in the previous quarter . Private consumption fell due to 
the second -wave outbreak which dampened confidence and household purchasing power . 
Stringent containment measures in some areas also held down economic activities, while 
government stimulus measures only  shored up household purchasing power partially . The 
tourism sector continued to experience a large slump due to the current domestic tourism 
situation and international travel restrictions . Public consumption moderated somewhat . 
Nevertheless,  merchandise exports registered st rong growth across many goods thanks to the 
recovery in external demand of trading partners, especially the exports of automobile and 
automobile parts, electronics, processed agricultural goods, and other oil -related products 
such as plastics and chemicals . This resulted in improvements in the manufacturing sector 
and private investment . Public investment also expanded .  
For the second quarter of 2021, latest economic indicators reflected that the 
Thai economy would expand for the first time since the COVID -19 pandemic  driven by 
private consumption, private investment, exports, and public expenditure . However, this 
was mainly due to the low -base effect from the same period last year . The Thai 
economy would slow  down from the previous quarter due to the sever e and protracted  
third -wave outbreak . Private consumption contracted due to deteriorating confidence and a 
sharp decline in household purchasing power . Some vulnerable workers were negatively 
affected by reduced labor income or by being laid -off. These wer e despite the fact that 
government measures had already shored up purchasing power to some extent, and 
progress was being made in the government ’s vaccine procurement as well as the more pro-
active approach to vaccine distribution . Exports of services rema ined low due to international  
travel restrictions and a more severe domestic outbreak . Meanwhile, merchandise exports 
continued to expand on the back of trading partners ’ recovery  which  benefited the  
manufacturing sector . Nonetheless, supply disruptions fr om the shortage s of manufacturing 
inputs, especially semiconductors and containers, became more pronounced, albeit the impact  on 
the manufacturing sector and exports were still limited . Private investment remained stable 
from the previous quarter .   
 
 
  
 
Monetary Policy Report   June  2021   15 Overall household income became more fragile due to the third-wave outbreak  despite 
improvements in farm income .  
 Non-farm income became more fragile due to the third -wave outbreak , especially 
for the self -employed  which accounts for one -third of the emplo yment in non -agricultural 
sectors . Social listening2/ data indicated that the self -employed were significantly affected 
by the third-wave outbreak  (Chart 2 .1). For employees in the social security system, which 
accounts for two -fifths of employment in non -agricultural  sectors,  unemployment claims 
remained high even as they were lower than during the first -wave outbreak . This was 
partly because some vulnerable workers had already been laid -off in the previous period 
(Chart 2 .2).   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Farm income grew in  tandem with higher agricultural prices, especially rubber, 
fruits, and palm oil . Rubber and durian prices increased on the back of recovering external 
demand, especially China . Palm oil prices rose from stock -ups by refineries to replenish their 
inventory  of raw materials that had been low for some time . Agricultural output increased 
slightly on account of higher  rice output due to heavier rainfall across all regions compared 
to last year .   
Headline and core inflation rose sharply in the second quarter of  2021 . This was due to 
the temporary low -base effect of energy prices and water bills last year in line with crude 
oil prices and the government measures to lower the cost of living .  
Headline inflation  averaged 2 .93 percent in the first two months of the second 
quarter of 2021, a marked increase from the -0.53 percent during the previous quarter 
(Chart 2 .3). This was attributed to the low -base effect of energy prices last year when crude 
oil prices slumped and the government implemented electricity bill su bsidies to lower of the 
cost of living in the wake of the first -wave outbreak . Meanwhile, fresh food prices registered  
a smaller contraction compared  to the previous quarter due to higher fruit prices .   
                                      
2/ Social listening data is a leading indicator that evaluate positive or negative sentiments towards being  
self-employed based on information gathered from comments and opinions on various online platforms that 
has phrases relating to self -employment such as  “Day-to-day jobs ”, “Grab drivers ”, and “E-commerce .”

Core inflation in the first two 
months of the second quarter of 2021 
averaged 0 .40 percent, an increase 
from 0 .12 percent in the previous 
quarter . Core inflation in the non -food 
category increased from higher prices 
of housing and furnishing mainly due 
to the low -base effect of water bills 
last year from government subsidies 
to lower the cost of living in the wake 
of the first -wave outbreak (Chart 2 .4). 
Meanwhile, core inflation in the food 
category increased from higher prices 
of prepared food and of seasoning and  
condiments (Chart 2 .5). Core i nflation 
in other categories saw small increases  
as demand -pull inflationary pressures 
remained low due to the impact of the 
third-wave outbreak .

Monetary Policy Report   June  2021   17 Both the short -term and long -term 
inflation expectations remained within  
the target range . The short -term (one-year 
ahead ) inflation expectations was 1 .7 
percent according to the survey  of 
businesses in May 2021, while those based  
on the survey of households in April 2021  
was 2 .3 percent . The short -term inflation 
expectations according to the survey of 
professional forecasters in March 2021 
was 1 .1 percent . The long -term five-year 
ahead  inflation expectations based on 
the survey of professional forecasts was 
1.8 percent in April 2021 (Chart 2 .6).  
 
 
 
 
 
The overall costs of financing  through bank loans and  bond markets remained low .  
During the second quarter of 2021,  
the overall costs of financing remained  
accommodative  as indicated  by the real 
policy rate in Thailand which remained low  
and consistent with other EMs  (Chart 2 .7). 
Short -term interest rates i n financial 
markets and short -term government 
bond yields remained at low levels 
close to the policy rate (Chart 2 .8). 
Medium -term and long -term government  
bond yields declined  particularly  in 
April 2021 (Chart 2 .9). This was mainly 
due to the decline in U .S. Treasury yields 
after the Fed signaled that it would maintain  
accommodative monetary policy until the U .S. economy achieve a sustainable recovery . The 
decline in medium -term and long -term yields was also attributed to foreign investors 
returning to Tha i government bonds to diversify portfolio amid low global yields . However, 
the new Emergency Decree led to a slight increase in the long -term Thai government bond 
yields in anticipation of increasing bond issuance . Nevertheless, the recent announcement 
by the Ministry of Finance regarding government bond issuance plans for the third quarter of 
2021, which did not include bond issuance under the new Emergency Decree,  saw 
government bond yields declined slightly, especially medium -term yields .

Overall private sector financing costs through commercial banks remained low 
as reflected by the benchmark lending rates of five largest commercial banks which were 
largely unchanged from the previous quarter . The MLR and MOR remained stable while the 
MRR e dged up slightly (Chart 2 .10). New loan rates (NLR)3/ declined from the last quarter to 
3.06 percent in April 2021 (Chart 2 .11), especially for loan contracts larger than 100 million 
baht in the trade and manufacturing sectors . Meanwhile, deposit rates  declined slightly from

Monetary Policy Report   June  2021   19 Private sector financing slowed down mainly on account of business credit,  while 
household credit continued to expand .   
In April 2021, private sector loans and bond issuances (private credit )4/ grew 
3.7 percent  from the sa me period last year (Chart 2 .14). This was a continuous slow -down 
from the first quarter of 2021 due to business loans and corporate bond issuances  which 
decelerated to 2 .5 percent from the same period last year (Chart 2 .15). Business loans 
slowed down acr oss many sectors including chemical products, construction, textile and apparel,  
real estate, and trade . However, lending to export -related manufacturing businesses such as 
petroleum and electrical appliances saw a slight expansion in line with strong expo rts growth . 
Corporate bond issuances in April 2021 registered a small expansion of 1 .4 percent from the 
same period last year . Bond issuance by businesses in the hotel and restaurant industry as 
well as other services sector continued to contract since the  second quarter of 2020 in tandem  
with sluggish activities in the services sector . Nevertheless, corporate bond issuance in the 
real estate sector picked up as most property developers needed additional financing for 
debt repayment and working capital purp oses . Bond issuance by logistics and warehousing 
businesses increased slightly . 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Household credit grew 4 .8 percent in April 2021 due to a continued expansion in mortgage  
loans driven mainly by sales promotion offered by developers .  
For the second quarter of 20215/, businesses and households would continue 
to require liquidity due the prolonged and highly uncertain outbreak . However, 
commercial banks would likely be more cautious in extending loans to vulnerable 
SMEs and households . It was expected that both large corporates and SMEs would seek 
financing mainly through commercial banks for the respective purposes of project financing

Monetary Policy Report   June  2021   20 and working capital . Bond issuance  would likely continue as normal because corporate 
credit spreads declined in all cr edit rating groups . However, it would still be necessary to 
monitor financing activities of businesses that are vulnerable and affected by the outbreak 
given that a prolonged outbreak could impact how much financing businesses can obtain as 
well as their a bility to rollover bonds . Meanwhile, household  credit demand was expected 
to pick up , especially auto leasing, credit cards,  and other personal loans, to be used for 
general consumption and liquidity management purposes given  low household  savings .  
Additi onal measures to provide financial assistance  for those affected by the new 
wave in the second quarter of 2021 would help some businesses and households obtain 
more credit . These measures include the special loan facility, the third phase of debt 
restructu ring programs to help retail borrowers, and debt mediation fairs . The efficacy of 
these measures warranted monitoring going forward .  
The baht against the U .S. dollar and the nominal effective exchange rate depreciated from 
the previous quarter in tandem w ith the third-wave outbreak  in Thailand . 
In the second quarter of 2021, 
the baht against the U .S. dollar  
depreciated from the previous quarter 
(Chart 2 .16). This was due to the third-
wave outbreak  in Thailand  and the high 
number of new COVID -19 cases whi ch 
continued to rise despite the 
vaccination progress . Towards the end 
of the second quarter, the baht quickly 
depreciated against the U .S. dollar on 
account of the stronger dollar after the 
Fed signaled the possibility of hiking the 
policy rate sooner tha n previous  market 
expectations . Between June 1 –22, 2021, 
the exchange rate averaged 31 .30 baht 
to the U .S. dollar, a 1 .7 percent  
depreciation from the March 2021 average .  
Between June 1 – 22, 2021, 
the nominal  effective exchange rate 
(NEER ) averaged 118 .62 and depreciated  
by 2 .1 percent from the March 2021 
due to the underperformed baht relative  
to most trading partner currencies (Chart 
2.17). The preliminary real effective 
exchange rate (REER ) in May 2021 
depreciated by 1 .8 percent from the  
March 2021 ave rage.

Monetary Policy Report   June  2021   21 The financial system remained vulnerable due to the impact of the third-wave outbreak  which 
exacerbated  fragile financial positions of some households and businesses . Debt servicing 
capabilities of the private sector must therefore be closely monit ored, especially after 
various support measures gradually phase out . 
The overall financial system remained vulnerable due to the impact of the  
third-wave outbreak  that delayed the recovery and increased uncertainties . On the one 
hand, financial institutio n stability remained robust, as reflected by the high level of capital 
buffers and reserves held by commercial banks as well as the ample liquidity in the banking 
system . This should allow financial institutions to withstand shocks from economic 
uncertaint ies in the period ahead . However, the balance sheets and debt servicing capabilities  of 
households and businesses remained fragile . For some households and businesses, these 
fragilities were also exacerbated by the third-wave outbreak . The details were as follows :  
1. Fragile household balance sheets remained a key financial stability risk . 
Household debt as a share of GDP rose from 89 .4 percent at the end of 2021 to 90 .5 
percent in the first quarter of 2021 . This was mainly due to contractions in GDP growt h in the 
first quarter in 2021 as well as the slight increase in household debt from the previous 
quarter . It would therefore be necessary to monitor the economic recovery that became 
more uncertain due to the third-wave outbreak , which could raise future household debt as a 
share of GDP . Debt servicing capabilities of households must also be monitored 
closely . Nonetheless, the share of non -performing consumer loans remained largely stable 
at 2.9 percent in the first quarter of 2021 due to (1) the relaxatio n of loan classification that 
slowed the deterioration in credit quality and (2) debt restructuring measures such as debt 
mediation fairs .  
Looking ahead, households  would still face risks stemming from the uncertain 
economic recovery due to the outbreak, especially those working in the services sector and 
the self -employed . This could hold down  their income and exacerbate debt servicing capabilities . 
Moreover, these households would still rely on continued financial and fiscal measures to 
alleviate the imp acts. As such, the credit quality of consumer loans must be monitored 
closely, especially the impact of the new wave and during the phase -outs of government 
measures .  
2. Financial positions of businesses, especially tourism -related businesses, 
remained fr agile and were aggravated by the third -wave outbreak . Overall balance 
sheets of businesses improved slightly in the first quarter of 2021, both the operating profit 
margin (OPM ) and interest coverage ratio (ICR), especially for the manufacturing and 
petrol eum-related businesses which partly benefited from improved exports growth . However, 
the financial positions of SMEs and tourism -related businesses, especially hotels, remained 
fragile . These businesses continued to incur losses, their debt servicing  capab ilities weakened, 
and the third-wave outbreak  would delay tourism recovery . The share of non-performing 
business loans remained stable at 3 .2 percent in the first quarter 2021, and that of SMEs 
was still elevated at 7 .3 percent in the first quarter of 2021 .   
While continued support from government measures partially alleviated the impact of 
the outbreak, in the period ahead the third-wave outbreak  remained highly uncertain and 
could result in a slower and more uneven economic recovery . Therefore, it was de emed  
 
Monetary Policy Report   June  2021   22 necessary to closely monitor the more fragile financial positions and debt servicing capabilities  of 
businesses, especially SMEs and tourism -related businesses . 
3. The real estate market remained fragile given the weak housing demand due 
to the impact  of the new outbreak and declining number of new projects from developers . 
In the first quarter of 2021, both demand and supply in the real estate market declined after 
having gradually improved during the second half of 2020 when the outbreak situation wa s 
subsiding . The number of ownership transfers for low -rise housing and condominiums in 
Bangkok and the vicinities  saw a sharp contraction  of 6.6 percent and 24 .3 percent from the 
same period last year,  respectively, when the outbreak was not as severe . The number of 
ownership transfers would likely decline in the period ahead from growing concerns over the 
outbreak and the uncertain economic outlook . 
Property developers continued to cut down new projects which resulted in a significantly  
lower number of ne w projects in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the pre-pandemic 
period . New low -rise housing and condominium projects in Bangkok and the vicinities fell by 
59.1 and 27 .7 percent, respectively, from the same period last year . Going forward, it would 
be necessary to monitor the behavior of property developers . In particular, competition 
among property developers could intensify amid the protracted outbreak of COVID -19. Such 
competition could prompt many developers to require additional liquidity, especia lly SMEs .  
Future risks pertaining to the oversupply of commercial properties  warranted 
close monitoring, especially office spaces . This was because office space supplies would 
increase markedly over the next 1  – 2 years . CBRE Thailand6/ assessed that the re would be 
approximately 300,000 square meters of new office space emerging in 2021, higher than the 
average of 200,000 square meters over the past 5 years . At the same time, there remained 
risks relating to the changes in renters ’ behavior that could res ult in lower rent, such as work 
from home arrangements and businesses opting to rent smaller office spaces to reduce costs .

Monetary Policy Report   June  2021   23 2.2 Outlook for the Thai Economy   
Thailand ’s economic growth was projected to slow down from the previous Monetary 
Policy Rep ort due to the prolonged third-wave outbreak  which could become more 
severe due to virus mutations . Risks that the economic growth would underperform the 
baseline projection were significant . Headline inflation outlook was largely unchanged 
and was expecte d to remain within the target range throughout the forecast period .  
The Committee assessed that the Thai economy would grow 1 .8 percent in 
2021 and 3 .9 percent in 2022, lower than the projected growth of 3 .0 percent in 2021 
and 4 . 7 percent in 2022 in  the previous Monetary Policy Report  (Table 2 .2). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The third-wave outbreak  that began in April 2021 had a severe and drawn -out impact 
on the Thai economy  from virus mutations that led to more widespread infections . The 
implementation of more stringent co ntainment measures negatively affected domestic 
spending . In addition, the assumption of foreign tourist arrivals was revised down significantly  
given the more severe outbreak situation in Thailand and abroad most recently . 
Nevertheless, greater clarity pe rtaining to the plan to procure and distribute  
COVID -19 vaccines helped to offset some of the economic impacts from the third-wave 
outbreak . It was expected that Thailand would attain herd immunity in the first half of 2022,  
supporting the resumption in e conomic activities and the further opening of Thailand ’s borders  
to foreign tourists by 2022 . Meanwhile, vaccine distribution among advanced economies were  
timely and began to produce results . Economic activities among trading partner economies 
thus recove red better than expected which benefited Thai merchandise exports . 
The government played a critical role  in supporting economic growth through the 
accelerated disbursement of funds under the 1 trillion baht Emergency Decree during the 
first half of 2021 as  well as the new Emergency Decree7/ (Box: Fiscal measures in response 
to the new wave of COVID -19). These  would provide additional economic boost through 
cash transfers and government spending . Progress in COVID -19 vaccine procurement and 
distribution as w ell as the global economic recovery would also support the Thai  economic  
recovery despite significant impacts from the third-wave outbreak . Overall, the Thai 
economy would slightly moderate and was expected to gradually recover in the latter 
half of 2021 b efore picking up further in 2022 .

Monetary Policy Report   June  2021   24  Additional assumptions underpinning the latest growth forecasts were as follows . 
First, the third-wave outbreak Thailand would be well contained by the beginning of the 
fourth quarter of 2021 . Second, at least 100 million  vaccine doses would be procured and 
distributed within 2021 as planned, leading to the attainment of he rd immunity by the first 
half of 2022 . Third, additional fiscal stimulus would be forthcoming under the new 
Emergency Decree that authorized 500 billion  baht of government borrowing .  
Headline inflation projection for 2021 was unchanged from the previous forecast  at 
1.2 percent  given subdued domestic demand and government subsidies to lower  the cost of 
living, despite higher crude oil p rice assumption  throughout the forecast period . Headline 
inflation projection for 2022 was revised up to 1 .2 percent  from 1 .0 percent in the previous  
Monetary Policy Report . This was attributed to the low -base effect from government subsidies  to 
lower the cost of living in 2 021. Headline inflation was expected to remain within the target 
range throughout the forecast period .  
Merchandise exports was expected to register higher growth thanks to strong outturns 
and expanding global demand .  
The value of Thai merchandise export s was projected to expand by  17.3 percent , 
significantly higher than the previous Monetary Policy Report at 9.0 percent . This upward 
revision was thanks to the much -higher -than-expected outturns in the first quarter of 2021 
across all product categories an d markets . Looking ahead, merchandise exports  was expected 
to maintain a strong expansion in tandem with trading partners ’ economic growth and a 
continued recovery in global trade . Supply -side constraint s such as migrant worker shortag e, 
factory outbreaks,  container shortage, higher costs of transport and raw materials, and electronic  
component shortage  may have some impact s on Thai merchandise exports going forward . 
However, it was expected that the impact s would be limited (Chart 2 .19) and thus the value of 
merchandise exports in 2021 would exhibit a strong expansion . The value of merchandise exports  
was expected to grow by 4 .9 percent in 2022 , a slight slowdown from the acceleration in 2021 .

Monetary Policy Report   June  2021   25 Exports of services would continuously contract  and r ecover more slowly than previously 
assessed .  
The tourism sector was expected to recover more slowly than previously assessed  
due to the third-wave outbreak  as well as more easily transmissible and severe mutants . 
Thailand could thus not start reducing qua rantine requirements to 7 days for travelers  arriving 
from abroad from the second quarter of 2021 . While the Phuket Sandbox would commence 
in the third quarter of 2021 as planned, the third-wave outbreak  would likely be a concern for 
foreign tourists and d eter trips to Thailand . For 2022, vaccine distribution plans around the 
world, including Thailand, would become clearer but the highly contagious and more severe 
variants could reduce vaccine efficacy . As such, tourism would unlikely make a swift 
recovery and the re -opening of Thailand ’s borders to foreign tourists must proceed with 
caution . The Committee revised down foreign tourist figures from 3 million to 0 .7 
million in 2021, and from 21 .5 million to 10 million in 2022 . 
The current account balance was p rojected to register a deficit of 1 .5 billion U .S. 
dollars in 2021 instead of a surplus of 1 .2 billion U .S. dollars from the previous forecast . 
The service balance would record a larger deficit due to lower tourism receipts as well as higher 
transportation  costs and oil prices . The trade balance was expected to record a larger surplus 
due to stronger merchandise export growth . For 2022, the current account surplus was 
projected to record 12 billion U .S. dollars, down from 25 billion U .S. dollars in the prev ious 
Monetary Policy Report owing to lower tourism receipts in line with foreign tourist figures .   
Private consumption was expected to gradually recover in the second half of 2022 .  
Private consumption would likely decelerate throughout the first half of 2022 
due to the more severe third-wave outbreak  and stricter containment measures . Nevertheless, 
private consumption would gradually recover in the second half of 2021 supported by 
cash handouts and additional stimulus, both under  the 1 trillion baht Emerg ency Decree that 
was effective from 2020 and the new 500 billion baht Emergency Decree  that came into 
effect on May 25, 2021 . In addition, the distribution of COVID -19 vaccines  had been  improving 
and was expected to meet the government ’s target . This would  be a key factor supporting 
private consumption recovery, especially during the first half of 2022 when Thailand was 
expected to attain herd immunity . This would improve consumer confidence and expedite 
the recovery in tourism and services spending in 2022 .   
Recovery of private investment would continue despite a slight slowdown  after the third wave .  
Private investment was projected to expand more than the previous forecast  in 
line with  significantly improving merchandise exports . However, the new wave of  COVID -19 
delayed investment somewhat during the first half of this year . These were reflected by the 
private investment outturns in  the first quarter of 2021 which decelerated but still higher than 
the previous assessment . Private investment in large infr astructure fell slightly  due to delays 
in the MRT Orange Line project, while investment for the third phase of Laem Chabang Port 
would commence sooner . From the second half of 2021 onward, private investment would 
continue to expand in line with strong mer chandise export growth and the gradually  
improving private consumption . The Committee thus revised up private investment from 
the previous Monetary Policy Report to 7.0 percent in 2021 and 6 .0 percent in 2022 .   
 
Monetary Policy Report   June  2021   26  
 
 Summary of key forecast assumptions  
 Trading  partner economies  would improve given better -than-expected outturns in the first 
quarter of 2021, especially the U .S. and Asian exports . Trading partner economies were 
projected to continue expanding throughout the forecast period supported by the timely 
implementation of vaccine distribution plans that would enable the re -opening of borders 
in 2022 . Meanwhile, the new waves of outbreak in many Asian countries and the shortage  
of electronic parts would have some short -term impact s on trading partner econom ies.  
 The Federal Funds Rate  assumption was unchanged at 0 .00 – 0.25 percent . While the dot 
plot from the latest FOMC meeting indicated an earlier rate hike, most FOMC members 
did not expect a rate hike during 2021 – 2022 .   
 Regional currencies (excluding the Chinese yuan ) weakened slightly in the short run due 
to the recent wave s of COVID -19 in many countries and improved investor sentiment 
regarding the U .S. economic recovery . Looking ahead, regional currencies would see 
some appreciation in tandem with t he regional economic recovery thanks to the U .S 
economy and further vaccination progress .   
 Dubai crude oil prices  were revised up throughout the forecast period on account of recent  
price outturns and the expected pick -up of oil demand in line with the gl obal recovery . 
 Farm income (excluding government support measures ) was revised up for 2021 on account  
of higher prices and output of key crops  driven by higher global demand, namely, rubber, 
palm oil, sugar cane, and off -season rice . In the period ahead, f arm income was expected  to 
benefit from more favorable weather conditions given higher -than-usual average rainfall 
in 2021 . Farm income growth would slow down in 2022 due to the high -base effect of 
agricultural prices in 2021 .  
 Public spending at current p rices  was revised down slightly owing to (1) lower -than-
expected budget disbursement during the first quarter of 2021 and (2) the change in 
planned expenditures under the 1 trillion baht Emergency Decree that were converted  into 
more cash transfers to alle viate the impact of the outbreak . The new Emergency Decree 
that authorized 500 billion baht of government borrowing would also bring about 
additional stimulus in the form of cash transfers to alleviate the impact of COVID -19. 
Expenditure under the new Emer gency Decree would commence in 2021 and continually 
provide economic stimulus through to 2022 .

Monetary Policy Report   June  2021   27 Headline inflation projection was largely unchanged . Core inflation project was revised 
down given subdued demand -pull inflationary pressures . 
Headline infl ation faced upward pressures mainly from supply -side factors . 
Costs of energy and fuel rose in tandem with global crude oil prices which resulted in higher 
inflation in the energy category . This was despite the government ’s electricity bill subsidies 
from May to June 2021  which helped to reduce energy costs somewhat . It was expected that 
rising global commodity prices such as metal and rubber would have limited impact on 
headline inflation . So far, the increase in price of those commodities had yet to spill  over to 
domestic consumer good prices due to difficulties of  producer price passthrough during the 
economic downturn . Thus, the likelihood of headline inflation continually rising was quite low 
(Box: Reflation in Thailand is coming ?). Meanwhile, core infl ation projection was revised 
down given that demand -pull inflationary pressures remained subdued and would recover 
more slowly due to the third-wave outbreak . The Committee projected that headline 
inflation would be 1 .2 percent in both 2021 and 2022, and r evised down core inflation 
projection to 0 .2 percent in 2021 and 0 .3 percent in 2022 .  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Thai economic outlook faced significant risks of underperforming the baseline due to  
virus mutations that could intensify the outbreak and reduce vaccine e fficacy .  
The Committee assessed that Thailand ’s economic outlook was subject to 
significant risks that could see growth underperforming the baseline . This is reflected 
by the risk fan chart based on Vine Copula models (Chart 2 .20) which is skewed to the 
downside , especially in 2021 (Box: Assessing risks to economic forecasts using Vine Copula 
models ). Nevertheless, there were several supporting factors counteracting those risks, 
namely,  (1) positive developments in vaccine distribution plans, (2) accelerat ed approvals of 
economic restoration projects under the previous Emergency Decree, and (3) the new 
Emergency decree authorizing 500 billion baht of government borrowing . Nonetheless, these 
tailwinds could not fully offset significant downside risks that co uld see the Thai economy  
underperforming the baseline . First, protracted outbreaks and virus mutations from both 
existing and new variants could lead to a public health crisis, affect domestic spending, and

relief and restoration could be lower than expected if projects under the new Emergency 
Decree faced approval delays or low disbursement rates . Third, balance sheets of businesses  
could be exacerbated by the new outbreak, especially the services sector, leading to 
widespread business closures and lay -offs. Dismissed workers could be unemployed for 
extended periods and eventually give up finding jobs . Further deterioration in business and 
household balance sheets w ould thus impinge on economic activities and cause a rise in 
debt defaults . Fourth, supply disruption and higher shipping costs may have more impact on 
Thailand ’s manufacturing and export sectors than expected .  
Risks to headline inflation and core inflati on outlook were balanced . Upside risks  
that could see headline and core inflation edge up higher than the baseline stemmed  from 
inflation abroad and greater -than-expected passthrough of rising global commodity prices to 
domestic inflation . Meanwhile, downs ide risks to the headline inflation and core inflation 
outlook were the same as those for the economy (Chart 2 .21 and 2 .22).

(500 billion baht Emergency Decree ) 
Recently, the government approved projects to help alleviate the impact of COVID -19 and resolve the 
outbreak in Thailand. These projects were funded by the Emergency Decree Authorizing the Ministry of Finance to Raise 
Additional Loans to Solve Economic and Social Problems as Affected by the Coronavirus Disease Pandemic, B.E. 2564 
(1 trillion baht Emergency Decree). So far, the government has used up almost all of the permitted borrowing amount 
and was facing a deadline to finalize its borrowing and bond issuance plans by 30 September 2021 . In this regard, 
it was necessary for the government to issue a new Emergency Decree authorizing up to 500 billion baht of government 
borrowing which would come into effect on May 25, 2021. This new Emergency Decree would provide additional funding to 
respond to the uncertainties pertaining to the COVID -19 outbreak as well as to alleviate its impact and restore economic 
growth once the pandemic subsides.

 Reflation in Thailand is coming ? 
In the recent p eriod, some countries had been experiencing reflation, global commodity  
prices saw large increases, and headline inflation in Thailand accelerated in the second 
quarter of 2021 . This raised the question of  whether domestic inflation  would rise further and 
what its outlook would be . Considering Thailand ’s inflation dynamics in recent times and the 
current inflation outlook, it was assessed that the reflation abroad, rising global commodity  
prices, and the sharp rise in domestic inflation all stemmed from tem porary factors 
that would not lead to significantly rising  domestic inflation . This is in line with the 
outlook of subdued medium -term inflation in Thailand . Key considerations were as follows : 
Consideration 1 : Inflation rose sharply in the second quarter  of 2021, but this was 
only a temporary increase on account of low -base effect from the previous year and 
thus cannot be characterized as stagflation . Inflation picked up to 2 .3 percent in the 
second quarter of 2021 . The increase was temporary and mainly a ttributed to the low -base 
effect of crude oil prices and the government measures to reduce electricity and water bills 
to lower the cost of living in 2020 . It was expected that inflation would gradually decline in 
the third quarter of 2021 and would be 
moving around the lower bound of the 
target range from mid -2022 onward due 
to several factors . First, demand -pull 
inflationary pressures remained soft . While  
demand would gradually recover thanks  
to government stimulus measures and the 
relaxation of containme nt measures, there 
would be several factors holding down  
demand -pull i nflationary pressures going 
forward, namely, elevated household debt, 
fragile labor markets, and consumer confidence  
that could be hampered by prolonged outbreak . 
Second, supply -side inf lationary pressures  would be limited  given that global energy 
prices were expected to rise at a gradual pace . This was in line with the pick -up in oil 
demand on the back of the global economic recovery and higher oil output from both the U .S 
and OPEC + coun tries. Fresh food prices would remain low given limited risk of drought at 
the present (Chart 1 ).   
Consideration 2 : Reflation in advanced economies and the rise of global commodity 
prices due to supply shortages would have limited spillovers to domestic i nflation 
due to several factors . First, Thailand ’s CPI basket has low import content at about 16 
percent . Rising global commodity prices would be transmitted mainly through oil prices . It 
was expected that inflationary pressures from oil prices would moder ate in the period ahead 
given gradual pace of crude oil price increases . Moreover, Thailand has an Oil Fund as a 
mechanism to stabilize domestic oil prices, limiting the first -round effect on domestic oil 
prices . The second -round effect on core inflation a nd fresh food prices would also be limited, 
since historical data indicated that oil prices would have significant impact on food prices and 
production costs only given sustained and sharp increases in oil prices . Second, reflation in 
advanced economies an d supply shortages are temporary and would likely resolve in 
early  2022  when pent -up demand is normalized and the manufacturing sectors gradually

 recover from the pandemic . Production costs would be slightly higher but would have limited 
impact on domesti c inflation (Chart 2 ) because rising production costs would be limited to 
some goods such as automobiles and electrical appliances that make up a small share of 
Thailand ’s CPI basket . Most businesses would also be able to cope with higher production 
costs  in the short -term for about 3 -6 months  
 
 
 
 
. 
   
 
 
Consideration 3 : Medium -term inflation in Thailand would remain low due to the following 
structural factors that  were  aggravated by the pandemic . First, the long -term unemployment  
and the number of people who exited the labor force rose . This was owing to the slow 
and uneven economic recovery as well as the increasing use of automation in  the 
manufacturing process to lower infection risks  and reduce costs in the long run . Second, the 
rapid growth of e -comme rce usage  by both businesses and consumers since the COVID -19 
pandemic intensified price competition . Third, other structural factors  continued to pose 
impacts, namely, aging population and the advancing shale oil technology .   
Nevertheless, inflation in T hailand could face some upward pressures from factors  
such as (1) pent -up demand  during the pandemic being released, triggering a pick -up in 
inflation,  (2) reduced reliance on global supply chains (de-globalization ) from strained 
global trade might result in higher costs of production and services, and (3) lower market 
competition in Thailand post -COVID  due to businesses being either permanently closed 
or acquired by a few large players . Overall, it was assessed that upward inflationary 
pressures  would not be as prevalent as downward pressures . As such, inflation 
would remain low over the medium -term and move within the target range .  
Various factors that led to the recent rise in inflation were transitory . Reflation in 
advanced economies and supply shortage s would have limited spillovers to domestic 
inflation . Inflation would thus be unlikely to increase significantly and remain within the 
target range . Medium -term inflation would be subdued mainly owing to structural factors .

Assessing risks to economi c forecasts using Vine Copula  models  
The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC ) had been using fan charts as the main tool 
to communicate about risks to its economic and inflation forecasts . Risk assessment  was 
based on the standard deviation of historical foreca st errors  together with expert judgement to 
ensure that uncertainties surrounding the forecasts account for all relevant risks and factors 
outside the model such as uncertainties of COVID -19. 
Nevertheless, the previous  risk assessment methodology for the fan charts had 
two limitations . First, it relied heavily on expert judgement . An analysis of past data found 
that fan charts constructed using the old methodology were much wider than those constructed 
using Vine Copula models, which reflected that experts  who provided their judgement might have  
overstated the risks (Chart 1 ). Second, the old methodology did not sufficiently account  for 
financial risks . The old fan charts primarily captured risks pertaining to the real sector .  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Against this backdr op, the Bank of Thailand (BOT ) developed a new risk 
assessment  methodology using Vine Copula models8/. Vine Copula models use  the 
distribution of different variables to analyze their  pairwise correlation and connecting them 
together until a system -wide cor relation is found . Analyzing different economic variables 
such as consumption, investment, exports and imports, policy rate, and financial cycle 
together under a single model with this methodology can explain how the distribution of 
these variables and eco nomic growth would be affected by distribution of other variables like 
trading partner economies ’ growth or foreign tourist figures . Vine Copula models are therefore  
suitable for risk assessment to construct a fan chart . The structure of Vine Copula models  is 
illustrated in Chart 2 . 
 
                                      
8/  For more details on Vine Copula Models, see Czado (2019 ), “Analyzing Dependent Data with Vine Copulas ”. 
The BOT is also publishing a new research paper – Woramongkhon (2021 ), “Analyzing Economic Tailed Risk 
in Thailand Through Vine Copula Simulations .”

Benefits of using Vine Copula models for risk assessment : 
(1) Transparent and less expert judgement . Vine Copula models cover a broad range 
of variables and analyze them in a systematic manner . Changes to the fan c hart are  thus 
determined largely by model correlation results, preventing it from being too wide or too skewed .  
 (2) More accurately identify the sources and impacts of risks . Using models in risk 
assessment makes visible the transmission channel and size  of the risks within the system .  
It can also assess the net impact of the risks affecting each of the variable . For instance, it will be 
able to illustrate how the overall risk to the growth outlook would change if trading partner 
economies ’ growth turned  out much stronger than expected but the severe COVID -19 outbreak 
also caused  delays in public investment . 
In addition, Vine Copula models can  assess how monetary policy affects  economic  
risks . In some cases, policy rate cuts could have a small effect on t he baseline economic 
growth but greatly reduce the risk that the economy would undergo a severe contraction . In 
such circumstances, the BOT ’s main forecasting model, which focuses heavily on the 
baseline, might not be able to reflect all the relevant infor mation . As such, the new Vine 
Copula -based model has a role in assessing growth  at risk9/ which would allow the MPC to 
have a more comprehensive set of information to assist their policy decision . 
(3) Provide insights on macro -financial linkages through co rrelation between the 
financial cycle and risks to economic growth10/. Empirical evidence showed that if an economic  
crisis and a financial crisis happened at the same time, the contraction in economic growth

would be exacerbated by tighter financial condi tions which affected growth severely and took 
a long time to recover .  
(4) More complexity in risk impact assessment . Vine Copula models can handle 
non-linear relationships without the need for additional assumptions . Thus, it could model 
highly complex re lationships between economic variables without requiring expert judgement . 
Examples include the asymmetric relationship between the financial cycle and private 
investment where private investment would not start picking up until later stages of the upturn  
in the financial cycle .    
The new methodology would help improve and sharpen the BOT ’s communication  
and assessment of risks to the economic forecasts , while also capturing financial 
sector risks . This new tool would be one of the tools that the MPC uses to assess risks to 
the economic outlook and deliberate the appropriate forward path of monetary policy which 
must carefully balance the intertemporal trade -off between supporting economic growth and 
safeguarding macro -financial stability . The BOT will publ ish fan charts that are constructed 
using the new methodology starting from the June 2021 Monetary Policy Report  onward . 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
Monetary Policy Report   June  2021   35 3. Monetary Policy Decision  
The MPC maintained the policy rate at 0 .50 percent . The Committee viewed that the 
procurem ent and distribution of vaccines together with expedited financial measures 
were the most important priorities for the Thai economy at  present . These  would provide 
support to the economic recovery more than cutting the policy rate from an already low level .     
At the meetings on May 5 and June 23, 2021, the Committee voted unanimously  
to maintain the policy rate at 0 .50 percent . The Committee assessed that Thailand ’s 
economic recovery would be slower and more uneven compared to the previous 
assessment . The third-wave outbreak  would affect the recovery in foreign tourist figures 
and domestic demand . Labor markets also became more fragile and might recover more 
slowly, especially the services sector and the self -employed . Nevertheless, the Thai 
economy would gain additional momentum from the increase in government spending from 
the new Emergency Decree and strong merchandise export growth in line with the global 
recovery . Headline inflation rose temporarily in the second quarter of 2021 due to the low -
base eff ect of crude oil prices in the same period last year . Meanwhile, reflation in advanced 
economies and supply constraints would have limited spillovers to domestic inflation . 
Medium -term inflation expectations remained well -anchored within the target range . Looking 
ahead, Thailand ’s economic outlook would still be subject to significant downside 
risks,  namely (1) the COVID -19 outbreak both in Thailand and abroad that could become 
more severe owing to virus mutations,  (2) the distribution and efficacy of vacci nes which 
would affect the re -opening of Thailand ’s borders to foreign tourists and domestic activities, 
and (3) more fragile balance sheets of businesses and households .  
The Committee viewed that the most important priority facing the Thai economy  
was the procurement and distribution of appropriate vaccines adequately and timely, 
together with expediting financial measures  especially the special loan facility and debt 
restructuring . These would provide more targeted assistance to the affected businesses a nd 
households than policy rate cut . The policy rate was already at a low level and cutting it 
might provide limited support to the economic recovery . The Committee thus voted to 
maintain the policy rate and would stand ready to use the limited policy space  at the most 
effective timing . In determining the appropriate course of monetary policy, key considerations  
were as follows . 
Thailand ’s economic outlook was subject to significant downside risks that could exacerbate  
the uneven economic recovery and the fr agile labor markets . 
The Committee assessed that there were significant risks that could result in 
the Thai economy underperforming the baseline projection . The protracted and more 
severe outbreak would further squeeze business liquidity and labor income i n the services 
sector, resulting in an uneven economic recovery that is more severe and prolonged . The 
Committee assessed different outbreak scenarios including the size and speed of vaccine 
distribution (Chart 3 .1) . Under the scenario that a new outbreak emerged due to a more 
easily transmissible and deadly mutant, herd immunity attainment  would be delayed from the 
first half of 2022 to the end of 2022, affecting foreign tourist figures and domestic demand . 
The Thai economy would slow down significantly fr om the baseline projection and the timing  
 
Monetary Policy Report   June  2021   36 in which it would return to the pre -COVID 
level would be pushed back from the end  
of 2022 to early 2023 .Therefore, the  
Committee viewed that the most importan t 
priority for the Thai economy at the present  
was the procurement and distribution 
of appropriate vaccines to tackle virus 
mutations adequately and timely, which 
would prevent the outbreak from being 
prolonged . Meanwhile, all parties should  
swiftly push forward the implementation  
of various measures, both fin ancial and 
fiscal, to produce results and support 
the economy especially during the next 
six months where uncertainties would 
remain high .   
The Committee viewed that 
the recurring outbreaks  increased 
labor market fragility . Recovery in 
labor markets wou ld be W -shaped 
and slower than the past  (Charts 
3.2 and 3 .3). It was expected that 
the number of people who transition 
from medium -term unemployment 
into long-term unemployment or exit  
the labor force would increase, most  
being from the services sector . 
This group of labor were dismissed 
but were unable to reallocate to 
the manufacturing sector where a recovery is underway due to skill mismatch . Meanwhile, 
the newly -graduated unemployed would continue to rise .Against this backdrop, the 
government should add ress vulnerabilities in the labor markets in an adequate and 
continuous manner to reduce long - term scarring effects after the COVID -19 outbreak 
subsided .

had been already fragile, were further  
affected by stricter containment measures . 
Credit risks also increased as a result of 
greater business uncertainties, making it 
harder for some businesses to access 
credit . Vulnerabilities in household balance  
sheets had been accumulating before the  
pandemic due to elevated debt levels .Most 
household debt are consumer loans  which  
are short -term and carry high interest rates , 
resulting in a hi gh monthly debt burden 
(Chart 3 .4). Meanwhile, household savings  
had been low in recent periods and would  
likely decline further . In this regard, the 
fragilities in household financial positions 
stemmed from both high debt burden and  
low savings . This was then exacerbated 
by the income shock from recurring  
outbreaks,  especially for employees in 
the services sector  and the self -employed  
(Chart 3 .5). As a result, private consumption  
would be negatively affected  and default 
risks would increase . 
The Committee viewed that the continuity of government measures and policy 
coordination among agencies would be critical given the highly uncertain economic 
recovery (Box: Risks to Thailand ’s economic recovery in the period ahead ). Measures 
should be designed so that th ey are well -targeted, adequate, and timely to provide a swift 
relief from the impact of the new wave outbreak . Fiscal measures must continue to provide 
adequate and continuous economic stimulus . Monetary policy must remain accommodative . 
The implementation  of targeted financial and credit measures should be expedited . These 
include  the special loan facility, the asset warehousing program, and other financial measures  
from specialized financial institutions (SFIs) to distribute liquidity to businesses and ho useholds  
affected by the new wave, reduce debt burden,  restore the economy, and encourage financial  
institutions to continuously expedite debt restructuring for its borrowers . The Bank of 
Thailand  (BOT) would continue to monitor and assess the progress of these measures 
closely going forward .

Monetary Policy Report   June  2021   38 The Committee viewed that the BOT  should assist financial institutions to 
expedite additional assistance to help borrowers . In the short term, measures to 
reduce debt burden, generate income, and reduce expenses  to enhance liquidity for 
affected households should be expedited . For example, the measures should expand the 
options for debt restructuring tailored to debt servicing ability of the borrowers and increase 
the channels for credit assistance through SFIs  and ke y non -banks in the retail loan market . 
The Committee also viewed that the extension of debt assistance programs for retail 
borrowers and the amendments in supervisory regulations would help financial institutions 
further assist the affected borrowers  and a ddress fragile household balance sheets (Box: 
BOT’s latest debt relief measures ) .  In the long run  all parties must cooperate to push 
forward measures to sustainably solve Thailand ’s household debt problem and  strengthen 
households ’ financial resilience aga inst future uncertainties . The measures should  
emphasize the prevention of excessive debt formation, promote financial  literacy, and 
expand options for reducing debt burden such as the refinancing market for retail borrowers . 
In addition, measures to gener ate sustainable income and promote  long-term savings would 
also be necessary . 
Thailand ’s economic structure and long -term growth potential will change after the pandemic  
subsides . Structural reforms will be critical to uplift Thailand ’s long -term growth po tential .  
The Committee reiterated the need for structural reform policies to raise the 
long -term potential  growth of the Thai economy  which had been affected by recurring 
waves of COVID -19 outbreak . This was reflected by the uneven recovery across differe nt 
sectors, especially the severely affected tourism sector, as well as the more fragile financial 
positions of businesses and households . Moreover, multiple waves of COVID -19 outbreak 
also aggravated existing structural problems  namely aging population, r ising income 
inequality with parts of the labor force facing longer unemployment and the self -employed 
earning less income, and excess capacity in some businesses . As a result of these structural 
problems, Thailand ’s long -term growth potential would likely  decline going forward . The 
Committee viewed that all related parties should jointly support structural transformation  
of the Thai economy by identifying key objectives and establish policy guidelines for 
both the short and long term as well as push forwar d their implementation . Upskilling 
and reskilling workers for the post -COVID environment and developing digital infrastructures 
would foster a sustainable economic recovery and bolster the resilience of the Thai economy 
against future negative economic sho cks. 
The Committee continued to put emphasis on supporting the economic recovery and stood  
ready to use additional appropriate monetary policy tools if necessary . 
 Under the monetary policy framework with the objectives of maintaining price 
stability, supp orting sustainable and full -potential economic growth, and preserving 
financial stability, the Committee continued to put emphasis on supporting the economic  
recovery . In addition, the Committee would monitor key factors affecting the economic outlook,  
namely the distribution and efficacy of vaccines, the possibility of the outbreak situation in 
Thailand and abroad becoming more severe owing to virus mutations, as well as the adequacy  
of fiscal, financial, and credit measures . The Committee would stand read y to use additional 
appropriate monetary policy tools if necessary .

 Risks to Thailand ’s economic recovery in the period ahead  
The Thai economy would likely experience a slower and more uneven economic 
recovery as a result of the third -wave outbreak . This most recent wave had been severe 
and protracted to the point of impacting domestic demand and exacerbating the fragile 
balance sheets of businesses and households . In the period ahead, economic growth would 
be supported by fiscal measures namely the recent  Emergency Decree authorizing  500 billion 
baht of government borrowing and from the progress of vaccine procurement . Nevertheless, 
there are significant downsides from the new wave of outbreak in Thailand and abroad that 
would likely become more severe due  to virus mutations and possible declines in vaccine 
efficacy . This would have significant impact on Thailand ’s economic recovery particularly  for the 
tourism sector . In this regard, the most important priorities for the Thai economy at the present 
are pro curing and distributing the appropriate vaccines in an adequate and timely manner to 
reduce downside risks to growth over the next six months . Meanwhile, all parties must help 
expedite the implementation of various measures, both financial and fiscal, to p roduce swift 
results and support the economy through these difficult times .  
Chart 1 . The Thai economy received additional tailwinds from financial and fiscal measures, but faced 
risks stemming from virus mutations .

  H2 - 2021  H1 - 2022  H2 - 2022  
Headwinds  - Credit relief and other 
financial measures expire  
at the end of 2021 .  
- Fiscal stimulus under the  
1 trillion baht Emergency  
Decree gradually phases out . 
- The outbreak becomes 
more protracted than 
expected and affects 
domestic spending . 
- The government is unable 
to reduce quarantine 
requirements from 14 days 
to 7 days .  
- Supply disruptions have 
significant impact and  
last longer than expected .   -  The 500 billion baht 
Emergency Decree 
expires in September 
2022 .  
 
Government spending is lower than expected due to  
a smaller FY2022 budget .  
Risks - The efficacy and coverage of 
vaccine distribution remain 
uncertain . 
- Virus mutations reduce  
vaccine efficacy . 
- The re -opening of Thailand ’s 
borders is delayed due to 
concerns over the virus 
mutations and vaccination 
delays in Thailand and abroad .  
- Supply disruptions could 
become more severe . - Tourism could change  
in the post -COVID world, 
resulting in lower -than-
expected foreign tourist 
figures .  
- Infrastructure 
investment and  
public -private 
partnership investment 
projects are delayed .  
Tailw inds to growth in addition to those already stated in the previous Monetary Policy Report  
come from the more broad -based distribution of vaccines, additional fiscal measures, and 
the re -opening of Thailand ’s borders to foreign tourists under the sandbox pr ograms .  
 In the second half of 2021, tailwinds to economic growth would come from the 
ramping up of vaccines distribution across the country and the additional fiscal 
measures in response to the third -wave outbreak . The latter include the “Half-Half”  
co-payment scheme and the “Ying Chai Ying Dai ” scheme to provide income support for 
those affected by the outbreak and boost domestic spending . Other fiscal measures are 
expedited FY2021 budget disbursement and the commencement  of government spending under 
the new 500  billion baht Emergency Decree . Financial measures  such as the special loan facility 
and the asset warehousing program would continue to provide liquidity support for businesses 
and help alleviate debt burden . In addition, the re -opening of Thaila nd’s borders to foreign tourists 
under the sandbox programs in certain tourist destinations would also foster a gradual  resumption 
of economic activities . For the first half of 2022, the re -opening  of Thailand ’s borders to 
foreign tourists without quaranti ne requirements if traveler s possess vaccination and

 COVID -19 test certificates  would help support the recovery in foreign tourist arrivals and in 
tourism -related services .  
Risks to growth in addition to those assessed in the previous Monetary Policy Rep ort are 
delays in the re -opening of Thailand ’s borders due to concerns over the mutation s of COVID -19 
and delays in COVID -19 vaccine distribution in Thailand and abroad .  
Risks to growth increased due to potential delays in the re -opening of Thailand ’s 
borders  due to concerns over the virus mutations and delays in COVID -19 vaccines 
distribution in Thailand and abroad . If the mutations of COVID -19 result in deadlier variants  
of the virus and reduce vaccine efficacy to the extent that new vaccines must be 
developed, plans to admit foreign tourists into Thailand might have to be pushed back . 
Toward the end of 2021, credit relief and other financial measures would expire and fiscal 
stimulus under the 1 trillion  baht Emergency Decree would phase out . It would be necessary 
to monitor  the situation closely and assess whether support is still needed . Supply d isruptions 
such as the shortage  of migrant workers and containers  could become more severe and 
prolonged, impacting the manufacturing sector . However, this situa tion was expected to be 
resolved within the first half of 2022 .  
Government measures would play a key role in driving Thailand ’s economic recovery which 
remained highly uncertain . Economic growth requires adequate and sustained financial and 
fiscal measure s.  
  Thailand ’s economic outlook remained highly uncertain and thus financial and 
fiscal measures would need to be adequate and sustained to  alleviate the economic 
impact and restore economic growth . Monetary policy  should remain accommodative . 
Financial measures and credit reliefs  should channel liquidity to those affected in a well -
targeted and timely manner and help support the economic restoration efforts going forward . 
Debt restructuring should also be expedited to reduce vulnerabilities among busines ses and 
households . The BOT must monitor and assess the effectiveness of the various measures 
closely, especially the asset warehousing program so that it could be adjusted to better suit 
the evolving circumstances .  
  Fiscal measures  must continue to supp ort the economy by sustaining an expansionary  
fiscal impulse . The government should also prepare additional fiscal measures  as contingency 
for the worst -case scenario . Meanwhile, supply -side policies  should be implemented  to 
transform business models and u pgrade labor skills so as to support a strong and sustainable 
economic recovery .

  BOT’s latest debt relief measures  
The highly uncertain COVID -19 outbreak had a broader and more severe impact  
on the economy . Many workers were affected by the sharp decli ne in income and their debt 
repayment capabilities deteriorated . Individual borrowers that received assistance from the 
recent measures still required continued support . New debtors whose fragile balance sheets 
were exacerbated by the new wave of COVID -19 outbreak also required assistance .  
In response, the BOT announced the third phase of its debt relief measures for 
retail borrow ers on May 14, 2021 . In this third phase, existing measures were upgraded  to 
respond to the more severe situati on and the focus shifted toward  reducing the debt  
burden in the long -term so that debtors have more options and flexibility , and were 
clearly aware of the various procedures . The BOT collaborated with eight financial 
service provider groups11/ to ensure that the credit reli ef measures could appropriately 
support affected borrowers . The measure covered  four types of loans (details in Chart 1 and 2 ). 
Debtors could apply for debt relief until December 31, 2021 . Financial service providers 
could also provide additional assistanc e on top of the BOT ’s measures .

10, 2021, a review of its banking regulations so that financial institutions could 
provide additional assistance for debtors affected by the most recent wave of COVID -19 
outbreak . Further, t he BOT implem ented mechanisms to incentivize financial institutions  
to expedite the debt restructuring efforts taking into account the debtor ’s potential 
and ability to adjust in the future  while maintaining the stability and sound risk management  of 
the financial inst itution  system by extending debt moratorium to December 31, 2021 as
