Monetary Policy Report 
 
 
The Monetary Policy Report  is prepared quarterly by staff of the 
Bank of Thailand with the approva l of the Monetary Policy Committee 
(MPC). It serves two purposes: (1) to communicate to the public the 
MPC’s consideration and rationales for the conduct of monetary policy, 
and (2) to present the latest set of economic and inflation forecasts, based 
on which the monetary policy decisions were made.

1.1 Growth and inflation prospects  
The Thai economy was likely to moderate 
more than previously proj ected, while inflationary 
pressure was poised to ease. 
In 2013, the Thai economy was expected 
to grow at a slower pace than previously 
projected. Main economic activities were likely to 
slow down. Private consumption softened from 
waning effects of the firs t-car subsidy scheme which 
came sooner than expect ed, coupled with rising 
household debt burden whic h constrained consumer 
spending. Meanwhile, private investment moderated 
in line with lower demand, both domestic and external, while merchandise exports were further The Thai economy was expected to grow at a slower pace than 
previously assessed. Private consumption was likely to moderate after having 
accelerated sharply in the previous periods driven by government stimulus measures. Export recovery could delay on the back of China’s economic 
slowdown and domestic supply constraints. Weaker domestic and external 
demand in turn caused further delays in private investment. Meanwhile, inflationary pressure was expected to ease in line with softening private demand, 
lower-than-anticipated world prices of oil and non-fuel commodities, as well as 
additional effects from domestic energy price policies.      
In the past two meetings, the MPC voted to reduce the policy rate by 
0.25 percent in the first meeting and hold the policy rate in the latter meeting. The 
MPC deemed that an accommodative monetary policy stance to help support domestic demand remained appropriate given rapidly changing global economic 
and financial conditions as  well as financial stabilit y risks which warranted close 
monitoring going forward.

-122    Monetary Policy Report  July 2013  affected by China’s economic slowdown and 
domestic supply-side problems following the disease 
outbreak in shrimps. Nevertheless, the MPC 
assessed that the Thai economy would gain momentum gradually going forward, supported by 
favorable income and employment conditions, 
accommodative monetary condi tions, both in credit 
and interest rates, as well as the gradual recovery of 
the G3 economies, which would help support Thai 
economic growth in 2014 (Chart 1.1  and Table 1.1) . 
The fragile global economy remained the 
key risk factor that could cause the Thai economy 
to expand lower than the baseline projection. The 
MPC viewed that Thailand’s trading partners’ 
economies could grow at a slower pace than 
expected if China’s econom ic slowdown persisted 
longer than anticipated  and caused widespread 
effects on Asian economies. Nevertheless, positive 
contributions from conti nued economic recovery in 
the US on the back of improving economic 
fundamentals, and the pick-up in the Japanese 
economy led by government  stimulus measures, 
would help support overall global economic recovery. 
However, in the short run,  the financial markets could 
be somewhat volatile due to  the anticipation that the 
Federal Reserve (Fed) could wind down its 
quantitative easing (QE), whic h in effect could cause 
further capital outflows from emerging markets. Domestic risk factors also shifted to the 
downside . There was a possibility that private 
consumption and investment  could slow down by 
more than expected during the end of 2013 when 
positive contribution from  government stimulus 
measures would end with the termination of these 
measures. Furthermore, spending on the water 
management projects could be delayed on account of 
the Administrative Court’s ruling that a public hearing must be sought on the projects. Overall, the MPC 
assessed that risks to economic growth would tilt -10-505101520

assessment of balanced risks.  The fan chart for growth 
was thus skewed down throughout the projection 
period  (Chart 1.2) . 
At the same time, inflation was poised to 
remain stable at the currently low level with 
inflationary pressure easing further compared to the previous projection.  This stemmed from lower 
demand pressure on the back of softer private 
demand, and lower cost pressure following the downward trend of world oil and non-fuel commodity 
prices. In addition, inflationary pressure also 
alleviated from the Committee on Energy Policy Administration’s (CEPA) decision to postpone the 
LPG price hike by another two months. Overall, 
inflation projections were thus lower than previously 
projected (Table 1.1) . Going forward, the MPC 
assessed that risks to inflation would slightly tilt 
towards the downside given the possibility that demand pressure could be lower than assessed in 
the baseline case as downside risks on economic 
growth outweighing upside risks. Fan charts for inflation were thus skewed downwards slightly, 
compared to those that were previously skewed up 
(Charts 1.3 and 1.4) .

and calculation by Bank of Thailand  4    Monetary Policy Report  July 2013  1.2 Economic outlook  
The Thai economy was likely to grow less 
than previously project ed due to moderate private 
spending, possible delays in export recovery and 
lower government stimulus than previously expected.  
The Thai economy was poised to moderate 
Thai economic growth was expected to 
slow down given that the main engine of growth, namely private demand, declined substantially 
from the previous projection. Economic indicators 
in April and May suggested that economic activities 
continued to slow down from the first quarter of the 
year. On this front, positive effects from the first-car 
tax rebate scheme on priv ate consumption faded 
sooner than expected. Priv ate investment moderated 
significantly on the back of weaker demand, both 
domestic and external. This  was consistent with 
manufacturing production which was expected to 
experience year-on-year contraction. Meanwhile, 
fiscal stimulus was likely to be lower than previously 
assessed in tandem with lo wer-than-expected budget 
disbursements of local governments coupled with 
disbursement delays in the water management projects. With regard to the external sector, 
exports were still poised to recover gradually , but 
possibly at a slower pace  than previously assessed 
owing to the more-than-expected slowdown of 
Chinese and Asian economies.  Nonetheless, imports 
of goods and services we re also expected to 
decelerate in line with softer exports and private 
investment. As a result, net  exports as a whole would 
contribute positively to ec onomic growth more than 
previously assessed.  
 Monetary Policy Report  July 2013                  5 Weakening domestic and external demand 
momentum could lead to lower Thai economic 
growth (Chart 1.5 and Table 1.2), especially in 2013 
where economic growth pr ojections were adjusted 
downward quite significantly (Table 1.1) . However, 
going forward, momentum of the overall economy 
was expected to improve gradually from the following supporting factors: (1) high employment and income, 
(2) investment demand by businesses as part of their 
production restructuring pl ans and in accordance with 
the government’s large-scale  investment projects, 
and (3) expected gradual recovery of export income 
in tandem with the recovering trend of the G3 economies. These positive fa ctors would help boost 
Thai economic growth in 2014 to grow close to the 
rate previously projected. 
 
           
The global economy should recover gradually  
Overall, the global economy would continue to 
recover slowly, but at a slower pace than previously assessed due mainly to China and Asia’s economic 
slowdown.  
Thailand’s trading partners’ economies 
were expected to recover gradually, although the 
momentum of recovery would be slightly lower 1,0001,0501,1001,1501,2001,2501,3001,3501,400

drag was the greater-than-expected slowdown of the 
Chinese economy, which in turn could cause Asian 
economies to moderate furthe r. Nevertheless, positive 
growth momentum from the US economy, which was 
expected to recover continuously on the back of 
improving economic fundamentals, and the recovery of the Japanese economy led by government stimulus 
measures, should support the overall recovery path of 
Thailand’s trading partners’ economies to remain intact. 
The US economy was likely to improve 
slowly as previously assessed (Chart 1.7) , 
consistent with impr ovements in economic 
fundamentals, especially in the housing sector which 
showed clear signs of recovery  as reflected by rising 
confidence and house prices . Moreover, the labor 
market recovered continuously with the unemployment 
rate trending downwards and non-farm payroll remaining strong.  Improvements in US’ real economic 
data were in accordance with the Fed’s signal to 
reduce asset purchases this  year which caused short-
term volatility in the global financial markets and could 
lead to an increase in long-term interest rates. 
Nevertheless, the MPC assesse d that a rise in long-
term interest rates would not have a large impact on 
the real economy. Although private spending in the US 
was likely to recover continuously going forward, reductions in government spending and uncertainties 
regarding deliberations on the debt ceiling increase 
would continue to put constraint on US economic recovery in future periods.  
Euro area economies became more 
stabilized and were expecte d to recover gradually 
(Chart 1.8) . The MPC viewed that euro area 
economies would recover more concretely during the 
latter half of 2013 as previously expected, mainly supported by major member economies. The recovery 2008 Q1

-1Monetary Policy Report  July 2013                  7 would be driven mainly by improvements in core 
member economies such as Germany which started to 
show signs of improvements in consumption and 
exports as well as in the manufacturing sector. Nonetheless, fiscal austerity measures implemented in 
many countries would continue to put constraint on 
recovery going forward and could affect economic activities more than assessed. The MPC evaluated 
that the Fed’s inclination to gradually reduce asset 
purchases would not have a significant effect on euro area economies. In addition, the MPC expected that 
improving US economic conditions and the stronger 
US dollar trend would somewhat help boost the euro area’s exports.     
The Japanese economy was likely to 
expand more favorably in 2013 (Chart 1.9) thanks to 
domestic spending which benefited from government 
stimulus measures, both the supplementary budget 
and continuous monetary policy easing which aimed to help pull Japan out of deflation. The MPC assessed 
that impacts from these measures would pass through 
to the real economy more concretely. Private consumption was expected to expand continuously, 
while the manufacturing sector started to exhibit 
positive signs as reflected by a pickup in the Manufacturing Production Index and business 
confidence. However, a more prolonged economic 
slowdown in Japan’s key trading partners-namely China and other regional countries-than expected, 
could pose risks to the Japanese economy going 
forward.  
Notwithstanding the improvement in 
Japan’s economic outlook, the outlook for 
Chinese and Asian economies weakened overall (Chart 1.10).  China’s economy was expected to slow 
down by more than anticipated by the market due 
mainly to sluggish exports and moderate investments in the manufacturing sector. In addition, liquidity

-18    Monetary Policy Report  July 2013  problems in the financial markets turned more 
severe, partly resulting from credit control measures 
and demand for liquidity which was sharply risen. 
Nevertheless, the manufac turing sector and business 
investments were expected to improve gradually 
during the latter half of the year spurred by economic 
recovery of the G3 count ries coupled with strong 
business profits and government measures to 
expedite investments. Meanwhile, China’s economic 
slowdown was expected to adversely affect other Asian economies via lower trade and commodity 
prices. The MPC evaluat ed that support from 
economic recovery in the US and Japan would not be enough to fully offset China’s economic slowdown. 
Furthermore, going forward, the MPC viewed that 
downside risks to Asia’s economic growth would increase from the risk that China’s economic 
slowdown could protract for longer than anticipated 
and from the risk of capital outflows from emerging markets due to the tapering of asset purchases by 
the Fed.  
Thai export recovery could be delayed Recovery of the Thai ex port sector was likely 
to be delayed. Economic recovery in the US was 
unable to fully offset the economic slowdown in China and Asia. Meanwhile, imports also decelerated in line 
with exports and investment. 
The export sector remained stable during 
the first half of the year, but a recovery in the next 
periods was likely to be slower than previously assessed due to the slight deceleration in trading 
partners’ economic recovery (Table 1.3). The MPC 
assessed that manufacturi ng exports across most 
industries, except for automobiles, were poised to 
slow down going forward. Exports of hard disk drives 
could moderate in line with softer world demand, while exports of integrat ed circuits could recover 
gradually with the economic recovery of the G3 Monetary Policy Report  July 2013                  9 countries. Meanwhile, exports of fishery and 
agricultural products were expected to be affected by 
supply shortages due to the disease outbreak in 
shrimps. Moreover, the expansion in rice exports was likely to be limited on account  of deteriorating price 
competitiveness.
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
The MPC evaluated that positive effects 
from the US economic recovery was unable to fully offset negative effects from China and Asia’s 
economic slowdown. Thai exports to the US had 
not yet fully benefited from the US’ economic recovery. This could be because improvements in US 
economic fundamentals would take time to pass 
through to the real economy. In addition, the disease outbreak in shrimps led to tepid exports of fishery 
products to the US sinc e the start of the year. 
Meanwhile, merchandise exports to China could be further affected from the Chinese slowdown, 
especially those for final consumption in China. 
However, exports of intermediate goods were expected to expand cont inuously thanks to the 
gradual economic recovery of the G3 countries.    
 At the same time, imports of goods and 
services were likely to moderate more than 
previously assessed (Table 1.3).  This was 
consistent with the expec ted slowdown in private 
spending and exports which had not yet fully 
recovered. The import value of machinery and 
equipment, especially that of  export-oriented sectors, Table  1.3 Forecasts for the external sector

the medium- to long-term should gain support from a 
gradual pickup in investm ents of manufacturers to 
restructure their produc tion process and from the 
government’s large-scale investment projects.  
 Looking ahead, the current account 
balance1/ was likely to record a lower surplus, but 
remained similar to the previous projection (Table 
1.3). This was attributable to improvements in the 
services account balance following the decline in freight payments due to lower merchandise imports, 
which helped compensate for the decline in the trade 
balance from softer export value. 
Private demand was poised to soften 
 
Private demand plateaued after accelerating 
sharply last year. Look ing ahead, private demand 
was expected to moderate from the previous 
projection. 
Private consumption was likely to remain 
stable after accelerating sharply in the previous 
periods on the back of government stimulus measures. The MPC assessed that private 
consumption would expand at a lower rate than 
previously anticipated due mainly to (1) sooner-than-expected waning of positive im pacts from the first-car 
tax rebate scheme, while higher debt burden from 
this scheme led households to become more cautious in their spen ding behavior which would 
affect consumption spendi ng, especially in durable 
and semi-durable goods, going forward, and (2) a decline in purchasing power of farm households 
compared to the previous assessment following lower 
farm income, partly due to rubber prices which could be adversely affected by the Chinese economic 
slowdown, while rice prices would continue to benefit 
                                                        
1/ Including reinvested earnings  Monetary Policy Report  July 2013                  11 from the government’s rice pledging scheme for 
some time. Nevertheless, the MPC viewed that 
sound economic fundamental s would continue to 
sustain consumption,  and would help support 
consumption growth to return to normal levels by 
2014. These economic fundam entals included (1) 
strong purchasing power of non-farm households, 
consistent with tight labor market conditions and high 
non-farm income, (2) accommodative monetary 
conditions given low interest rates and continued private credit expansion despite some signs of 
financial institutions’ credit tightening, (3) the 
depreciation of the baht wh ich would benefit export 
income in baht terms, and (4) persistently low and 
stable inflation. 
Private investment was expected to 
expand at a lower rate, particularly in 2013, in line 
with the export and domestic consumption 
trends.  This partly stemmed from excess capacity in 
the business sector which l ed to investment deferrals 
during periods of weak foreign demand and sluggish 
domestic demand. Overall, however, investment 
demand would still remain in order to restructure the 
production process to replace manual labor 
replacement. The aforementioned slowdown was consistent with the declining import value of capital 
goods in the manufacturing sector, particularly 
export-oriented, which had remained low since early 2013. Nevertheless, the MPC assessed that 
investment would gain moment um more concretely in 
2014, thanks to medium and long-term supporting 
factors, most importantly (1) the need to restructure 
the production process to accommodate labor 
shortage problems, (2) high levels of application and 
issuance of investment prom otion certificates by the 
Board of Investment (BOI), of  which most were found to 
undertake their investments in accordance to their investment promotion applications, (3) supportive 
monetary conditions for corporate loan expansion, and 12    Monetary Policy Report  July 2013  (4) large-scale public invest ment projects which were 
expected to crowd in privat e investment, especially 
long-term public investment in infrastructure, despite 
short-term investment delays in the water management projects.  
Looking ahead, the MPC vi ewed that the Thai 
economy would still be fac ed with many important 
structural problems, such as problems regarding the 
logistic system, water management, as well as the 
labor supply problems which are currently the main structural constraints on corporate investment, 
both in terms of labor shortages and low labor 
productivity growth . The MPC assessed that the Thai 
labor market would remain tight, while labor force 
growth would be limited. This in turn could affect 
businesses’ investment de cisions to expand capacity 
utilization, as well as put pressure on some 
entrepreneurs to move their production base to 
neighboring countries with lower wages. Moreover, Thai labor productivity in previous periods had decelerated 
sharply from the past, and grew substantially slower 
than other countries in the region. This was in part a result of labor movement from high productivity 
economic sectors to low produc tivity sectors. The MPC 
viewed that these limita tions were long-standing 
structural problems which would take time to resolve 
and emphasized that macroeconomic policies that 
aimed to reduce constraints on the manufacturing sector and to support continued private demand 
momentum were of essenc e (more details in BOX: 
Labor Supply Constraints and Economic Growth). 
Continuous fiscal stimulus 
The public sector would continue to provide 
economic stimulus. Howeve r, overall spending could 
decline slightly from the previous assessment given 
risks of delayed disbur sements of non-budgetary 
expenditures.  Monetary Policy Report  July 2013                  13 Fiscal policy would continue to provide 
economic stimulus going forward  as reflected by 
budget deficit  which was relatively high in proportion 
to GDP. Although the budget deficit was expected to decline from 300 in fiscal year 2013 to 250 in fiscal year 
2014, non-budgetary expenditures were likely to 
increase in the next fiscal year (Chart 1.11) . 
Compared to the previous projection, fiscal 
stimulus was likely to decline slightly  as a result of 
deferred disbursements of local governments and postponement of some spending on the 
water management projects (Table 1.4). Budgetary 
expenditures declined from both current and capital expenditures, due partly to lower-than-expected 
disbursements of local governments owing to the 
delay in disbursements of transfers and allocation of funds from the central government. For non-
budgetary expenditures, the MPC reduced its 
assumption on the amount of funding for the water management projects throughout the projection 
period to comply with the ruling of the Administrative 
Court that a public hearing must be sought before proceeding with the projec ts. This could cause 
postponement of projects  that had not yet been 
approved. Meanwhile, the assumption on the two trillion baht infrastructure project remained 
unchanged as the bill drafting process was in 
accordance with the expected plan.

Source: Bureau of the Budget and calculation by Bank of Thailand14    Monetary Policy Report  July 2013  Inflationary pressure was likely to ease  
 Inflationary pressure eased continuously 
since the beginning of the year due to softening 
demand and lower production costs. Risks to inflation were slightly skewed downwards . 
 Going forward, inflationary pressure was 
likely to remain low, with demand pressure 
easing from sluggish private spending. This was 
consistent with the output  gap remaining close to 
zero throughout the projection period (Chart 1.12) . 
The MPC assessed that  household consumption 
could be affected by the higher debt burden, while the purchasing power of farm households could 
decline in line with the subdued farm income trend. 
Meanwhile, the corporate sector was likely to postpone some investments on the back of delays in 
export recovery and softeni ng domestic consumption. 
Lower demand pressure would also lessen the pass through of production costs to prices. 
 Cost pressure was also likely to soften in 
line with the expected decline in world oil and non-fuel commodity prices. The MPC slightly 
reduced the Dubai oil price  assumption in the 
baseline case to average at 104 US dollars per barrel for 2013 before stabilizing at 105 US dollars per 
barrel for the rest of the projection period (Chart 
1.13) . This adjustment was on account of the 
somewhat lower global demand trend, mainly from 
China and Asia. Meanwhile, the supply of world 
crude oil was likely to increase slightly following higher crude oil production in non-OPEC countries. 
Overall however, the MPC viewed that world oil 
prices would remain close to the current level going forward, with demand and supply fundamentals 
balancing out. As a result, high case and low case 
assumptions on the Dubai oil price was balanced at half a standard deviation above and below the 
baseline path. At the same time, pressure from world -12-10-8-6-4-2024

-10Monetary Policy Report  July 2013                  15 non-fuel commodity prices  also declined (Chart 
1.14)  in tandem with metal prices which fell in line 
with lower demand from China. The MPC viewed that 
commodity prices would grow at a low level throughout the projection peri od, consistent with the 
gradual global economic recovery. Meanwhile, fresh 
food prices  increased somewhat in the short-term 
from higher-than-expected actual prices and 
prolonged supply problems (Chart 1.15) .   
Moreover, Thailand’s policy on energy 
prices would also have an impact on cost 
pressure. The MPC maintained the assumption of a 
diesel excise tax exemption throughout the projection 
period and postponed the hike in LPG prices for 
another two months for both the household and 
transport sectors to adhere to the Committee on Energy Policy Administrati on’s (CEPA) decision. This 
was expected to further ease cost pressure in the 
short-term, despite higher oil import costs from the relatively weak baht compared to the previous periods. 
Looking ahead, the MPC assessed that 
risks to inflation would tilt slightly towards the downside  given the possibility that domestic 
spending could grow less than expected, which in 
effect, would lead to lower production cost pass-through.  
Alternative scenarios 
The MPC appraised that there were various 
scenarios where Thai economic growth could deviate 
from the baseline case. T he MPC thus took these 
scenarios into consideration to reflect key risk factors 
on the Thai economy and inflationary pressure going 
forward. 
Scenario 1: The Chinese economic slowdown 
intensified and protracted  more than assessed.

could adversely affect Chi na’s manufacturing production 
and cause Asian economic growth to slow down more 
than anticipated. Furthermore, there was a chance that tight liquidity problems in the financial markets in 
China could spread out and turn into a systemic risk. 
Under this scenario, the MPC appraised that Thailand’s economic growth could be lower than 
assessed in the baseline case due to an additional 
factor of sluggish exports of consumer goods for Chinese consumption. Moreover, world commodity 
prices could decline further from softer Chinese 
demand, in particular rubber prices which make up  a significant proportion of Thai farmers’ income.  
Scenario 2: Private consumption grew less 
than the baseline case. Although the adjustment in 
private consumption during the first half of the year 
was expected, the slowdown was more pronounced 
than anticipated. Moreover, there was a possibility that 
household spending could be lower than assessed in 
the baseline case should the higher household debt 
burden from the first-car scheme cause commercial banks to tighten their lending standards and 
consumers to exercise more caution in their spending 
behavior, in particular those in low and medium- income households. This could further affect 
consumption of durable and semi-durable goods more 
than expected in the baseline case. In this scenario, the MPC assessed that the Thai economy would 
expand less than the baseline case from lower 
spending and postponement of businesses’ investment decisions.  
Under both scenarios, the MPC appraised that 
an accommodative monetary policy stance remained appropriate. The MPC would take a wait and see 
approach and could postpone interest rate 
normalization for some time.
 Monetary Policy Report  July 2013                  17 1.3 Monetary policy decision   
 Monetary policy stance remained accommodative  
In the past two meeti ngs, the MPC voted to 
reduce the policy rate by 0.25 percent in the first 
meeting and hold the policy rate in the latter meeting. 
The MPC deemed that an accommodative monetary policy stance to help support domestic demand 
remained appropriate giv en rapidly changing global 
economic and financial conditi ons, as well as financial 
stability concerns which wa rranted close monitoring. 
In its meetings on May 28-29, 2013, the MPC 
assessed that the global economic recovery was 
slower than expected due mainly to China and Asia’s 
lower-than-expected economic growth. Meanwhile, global financial markets remained volatile, which 
could lead to capital flow and exchange rate volatility 
in the region. In 2013 Q1, The Thai economy grew less than expected from tepid domestic demand, 
which could weigh on ec onomic momentum going 
forward. Moreover, exports were subjected to more downside risks from growth moderation in regional 
economies, especially China.  Meanwhile, inflationary 
pressure eased further owing to lower production costs, while growth of private credit and household 
debts remained elevated. The MPC judged that the 
Thai economy should continue to expand on the back of sound economic fundament als, although downside 
risks had increased from lower ‐than-expected growth 
in the first quarter of this year. As inflation remained well within the target, monetary policy had room to 
further cushion against downside risks from domestic 
demand. Against the backdrop of continued financial stability concerns, the MPC thus voted unanimously 
to reduce the policy rate by  0.25 percent from 2.75 to 
2.50 percent per annum. The MPC would closely monitor developments of the Thai economy, financial 18    Monetary Policy Report  July 2013  stability risks as well as the capital flow situation, and 
stand ready to take appropriate action as warranted. 
In its subsequent meetings on July 9-10, 
2013, The MPC appraised t hat the overall global 
economy expanded less than assessed in the 
previous meeting due to China’s economic slowdown 
which weighed on the recovery of Asian exports, despite some improvement s in the US economy  
and stronger Japanese economic growth from 
government stimulus policie s. Growth of the Thai 
economy moderated from a slowdown in domestic 
demand and exports. This was partly because 
consumers exercised more caution in their spending 
behavior as a result of t he rising debt burden, coupled 
with waning government st imulus measures. Exports 
decelerated from domestic supply constraints as well 
as China’s slowdown. Weak domestic and external 
demand in turn caused further delay in private 
investment. The MPC evaluated  that the slowdown in 
domestic demand was partly an adjustment from the 
previous extraordinary growth induced by government 
stimulus measures, and t hus should resume its 
normal growth path in the periods ahead. This was 
supported by sound underlyi ng fundamentals, as well 
as accommodative monetary and fiscal policies as reflected in continued privat e credit growth and fiscal 
deficits, which would help  boost domestic demand 
growth. Meanwhile, rapidly changing global economic and financial conditions, as well as risks to domestic 
financial stability warrant ed close monitoring. The 
MPC thus voted unanimously  to maintain the policy 
rate at 2.50 percent per annum.

2.1 The global economy  
The US economy recovered gradually 
following improvements in employment and the 
housing sector which would be important drivers of 
economic growth going forward.      
In 2013 Q1, the US economy expanded by 
1.8 percent on a quarter-o n-quarter, seasonally 
adjusted annualized basis (qoq saar) (Chart 2.1) , 
accelerating from the previous quarter which grew 
0.4 percent. This was attributable to a pickup in domestic demand, especially from strong private 
consumption growth fo llowing improvements in 
employment and the housing sector. 
In 2013 Q2, the US economy was expected 
to slow down from the previous quarter. This was 
mainly due to budget sequestration which came into effect since March 2013, re sulting in public spending The global economy was expected to expand at a more subdued pace in 
light of China’s and Asia’s slower gr owth. This would weigh on Asian export 
recovery in the period ahead. Meanwh ile, G3 economies were expected to 
improve gradually, with the US economy showing some signs of recovery on the 
back of improving housing and labor mark et conditions. The euro area economy 
started to stabilize, while Japanese ec onomic growth gained better pace thanks 
to the government’s econ omic stimulus package. 
The Thai economy in 2013 Q2 was expected to moderate compared to 
the same period last year due to softer domestic demand on the back of more 
cautious household spending and waning fiscal stimulus measures. Exports 
slowed down as a result of the weaken ing Chinese economy as well as domestic 
supply constraints. Weak domestic and external demand in turn caused further 
delay in private investment. Meanwhile , inflationary pressure eased due to 
softening domestic demand and lower production costs.

industry would be particular ly affected by the budget 
cuts. At the same time, tax hikes, for example on 
personal income taxes and payroll taxes, which came into effect in January, would start to weigh on private 
consumption from this quarter onwards.  
Nevertheless, the MPC anticipated that the 
US economy would conti nue to show gradual 
improvements despite the dr ag of sequestration. This 
was due to continued improv ements in employment 
conditions and a concrete recovery in the housing

Euro area economies remained weak, but 
started to show some signs of improvement and was 
expected to recover gradually in the latter half of 2013.  
In 2013 Q1, euro area economies

quarter-on-quarter by 0.2 percent, compared to the previous quarter’s cont raction of 0.6 percent (Chart

the first quarter, compared to  the previous quarter’s 
contraction of 0.7 perc ent. The improvement was 
attributable to private cons umption growth which had 
turned positive, while growth in exports and private 
investment remained negative. Meanwhile, the 
French economy contracted by  0.2 percent, the same 
level as the previous quart er, on the back of declining 
domestic and external demand. The Italian economy 
contracted by 0.6 percent, wh ile that of the Spanish 
economy continued to contra ct by 0.5 percent  
(qoq sa) owing to fiscal austerity measures and high 
unemployment.   
The second quarter of 2013 saw further 
economic stabilization, as reflected by continuous 
growth in manufacturing production and an expansion in export growth to non-euro countries 
after experiencing contracti ons in the last 2 months. 
In particular, exports to the US started to turn positive. At the same time, economic sentiment 
indicators of the euro area economy and core 
members improved continuous ly after the political 
situation in Italy and the financial crisis in Cyprus 
subsided. The Purchasing Managers Index adjusted 
upwards slightly from last quarter’s average of 47.6 to 
stand at 47.8, while Germany ’s indicator of economic 
sentiment increased from 105.3 to 106.1 this quarter 
(Chart 2.4). 
 
 Looking ahead, the MPC assessed that the 
euro area economy would gradually recover in the 
latter half of 2013, driven by the manufacturing sector which started to show si gns of improvement and a 
continuous pickup in private sector confidence. In the 
longer term, the economy was expected to benefit from greater emphasis placed on economic 
restructuring with recommendations having been 
given to member states to focus on enhancing competitive advantage and addressing high Source: BloombergChart 2.4 Euro Area Purchasing Managers Index

The Japanese economy star ted to show signs 
of recovery and was poised to expand gradually. Main drivers included privat e consumption and public 
spending stemmed mainly from  government stimulus 
measures.  
In 2013 Q1, the Japanese economy grew by 
1.0 percent, accelerating from the previous quarter which expanded by 0.3 percent (Chart 2.5) . This was 
mainly attributable to private consumption which 
benefited from government st imulus measures and a 
pickup in exports following recovery in demand of 
trading partners’ economie s, especially the US.  
The Japanese economy in 2013 Q2 was 
expected to recover cont inuously thanks to funding 
from the supplementary budget in 2012 which had 
begun to enter into t he economic system via 
investments to repair buildings damaged by the 2011 
earthquake and maintenance repairs on infrastructure. 
At the same time, consum er and producer confidence 
picked up, in part from  government stimulus 
measures and increased bus iness profits from the 
weaker yen. This in turn, helped boost recovery in private consumption. M eanwhile, manufacturing 
production was expected to recover gradually, as 
reflected by the continuous increase in the Manufacturing Production Index
 since the previous 
quarter.   
Looking ahead, the MPC appraised that the 
Japanese economy would improve on the back of 
increased public spending as  part of government 
stimulus package, and priv ate consumption thanks to 
continuous improvements in  consumer confidence. 
This was reflected in an increase in financial asset 
prices and the healthier l abor market. The continued 
accommodative monetary policy also helped support -3-2-10123

market operations from an uncollateralized overnight 
call rate to a monetary base. 
Chinese and Asian economies were expected 
to moderate in 2013 Q2 following the deceleration in the manufacturing and export sectors, while domestic 
demand continued to play a key role in economic 
growth.  
In 2013 Q1, the Chinese economy grew by 
7.7 percent, slowing down from 7.9 percent in the 
previous quarter, due mainly to a decline in investment. Economic activity moderated in 2013 Q2 
compared to the first quarter, following a slowdown in 
the manufacturing sector, investment and exports, 
while consumption remained unchanged (Chart 2.6) . 
The substantial decline in exports was in part due to 
the new rules issued on May 5, 2013 that strengthened the oversight of  over-trade invoicing. 
Going forward, the MPC appr aised that the Chinese 
economy would grow less than anticipated due to 
lower-than-expected expor ts and investments, 
particularly in the first half of 2013. The economy was 
expected to improve in the second half of 2013 driven by domestic consumption with support from strong 
employment and income as well as exports which 
would recover slowly in line with an anticipated pickup in the global economy.
 Nevertheless, 
economic growth would not be as high as observed 
in the past following the Chinese government’s policy to give priority to economic stability.
  
In 2013 Q1, most regional economies grew 
less than previously expe cted, which led economic 
activity in the second quarter to also grow at a slower Chart 2.6  China’s economic indicators

in line with softer manufacturing production and 
investment, while exports remained sluggish despite 
gradual improvements in some export categories such as electronics, in particular smart phones and 
communication equipment. In order to support 
economic recovery, the South Korean and Taiwanese governments announced measures  
to help stimulate consumpti on and investment in May 
2013. In 2013 Q2, economic activities of ASEAN 
economies began to show signs of weakening from 
the previous quarter. This was in part due to 
persistently sluggish exports, particularly those to China which had moderated continuously since the 
first quarter. However, strong domestic demand in 
this region so far had remained an important driver of economic growth. 
 Looking ahead, the MP C appraised that 
regional economies would see lower than anticipated 
growth, due to the more-than-expected economic 
slowdown in China, one of the region’s major trading 
partner. However, regional economies would gradually improve in the latter half of 2013 in 
anticipation of continuous domestic demand strength 
and a slowly recovering export sector in tandem with the global economic recovery , particularly in the US 
and Japan which would help boost exports to some 
extent. 
2.2 The domestic economy  
 In 2013 Q1, the Thai economy expanded at a 
slower rate compared to the same period last year, 
both in terms of expenditures and manufacturing 
production. Consumption and investment of the 
private and public sectors slowed down from the 
previous quarter. At the same time, the gradual Monetary Policy Report July 2013                                       29 recovery of global economy had yet to offset sluggish 
domestic demand, which resulted in a moderation in 
manufacturing overall. 
Economic conditions in 2013 Q1  
In 2013 Q1, the Thai economy grew year-on 
year by 5.3 percent (Chart 2.7) , slowing down from 
the previous quarter owing mainly to the deceleration 
in manufacturing and services sectors. 
Manufacturing production  expanded year-on-year 
by 4.8 percent, slowing from the previous quarter 
which rose considerably from a low base in 2011 due 
to the floods. Manufactu ring for domestic demand 
grew at a slower rate compared to the previous 
quarter in which the automobile production was 
accelerated to full capacity. Consequently, the production could not incr ease further until capacity-
enhancing investments were to be completed. 
Meanwhile, manufacturing fo r exports contracted 
year-on-year as production of hard disk drives and 
integrated circuits were affected by sluggish external 
demand. In addition, production of frozen shrimp declined from a supply shor tage following a disease 
outbreak.   
The services sector  expanded year-on-year 
by 6.7 percent, but slowed down from the previous 
quarter mainly from the trading sector and the hotel 
and restaurant sector. This was consistent with the 
slowdown in domestic demand and the tourism 
sector as reflected by the number of foreign tourists. 
At the same time, the construction sector moderated in line with public and private investment and was 
also affected by higher construction material and 
labor costs.   
Agricultural outputs,  overall, grew slightly at 
0.5 percent from the same period last year, slowing 
from the previous quarter due to major agricultural outputs, namely rubber and sugar cane, which -10-505101520

conditions. Meanwhile, production of rice, palm oil 
and cassava continued to expand well. Fishery 
production contracted as a result of a substantial 
decline in shrimp output  due to the continued 
outbreak of the early mortality syndrome (EMS). 
Continual economic expansion led to a low 
unemployment rate of 0.7 percent in 2013 Q1, similar 
to the same period last year. So far, the nationwide 
minimum wage hike to 300 baht implemented since January 1, 2013, had not shown to cause abnormality 
in unemployment condition. This was due to 
continued tightening of the l abor market over the past 
several years. As demand for labor remained high, 
laid-off workers were thus generally re-employed in 
other manufacturing sectors. In addition, businesses had already made adjustments to mitigate impacts 
from higher labor costs.  
Demand in 2013 Q1 expanded at a slower 
rate following last year’s sharp acceleration both in 
consumption and private in vestment. At the same 
time, exports slowed down in line with the slow pace of global economic recovery , consistent with the 
decline in export-oriented manufacturing production.

by 4.2 percent (Table 2.1) , decelerating from the 
previous quarter due to lower demand for non-
durable goods, particularly in oil and gas. Demand for durable goods also slowed, in particular that for 
automobiles, as extraordinary expansion of car 
orders induced by the fi rst-car tax rebate scheme 
started to taper off. Private investment  expanded by 
3.1 percent year-on-year, sl owing from the previous 
quarter. Investment in machinery and equipment decelerated considerably after having increased 
substantially last year to replace and repair flood-
related damages. Furthermore, the slow recovery in the global economy led some businesses to 
postpone their investment plans. Investment in 
construction also moderated due mainly to a slowdown in residential and office building 
constructions.   
The slow global economic recovery led 
exports of goods and services  to expand by merely 
8.4 percent, a significant decline compared to the 
previous quarter, particul arly in electronics, metal 
products, machinery and automobiles. In addition, 
exports of fishery products also shrunk due to the 
supply shortage of shrimps.  However, exports of 
agricultural products improved led by rubber and 
cassava exports. At the same time, exports of 
services expanded in res ponse to a continuous 
increase in the number of foreign tourists, particularly 
from Russia and China. Meanwhile, freight receipts 
and other transport receipts declined in line with slower international trade.  
The slowdown in domestic consumption 
together with a slow recovery in exports led to a deceleration in imports of goods and services  
which recorded 8.2 percent growth from previous 
quarter. The moderation was seen across all import categories, in particular, the import of capital goods, 32                          Monetary Policy Report  July 2013  raw materials and intermediate goods such as 
electronic parts, metal products and petroleum 
products. Import of services also slowed down from 
the previous quarter due to a decline in freight payments in line with slower international trade, 
despite the increase in travel expenditures as more 
Thais travelled abroad.  
The public sector  expanded at a slower rate 
both in terms of consumpt ion and investment due to 
delays in disbursements by local governments and disbursement under the Emergency Decree on Water 
Management. Nevertheless, disbursements on 
budgetary spending by the central government and 
investments by state-owned enterprises were at 
normal levels. 
The economic outlook for 2013 Q2
3/  
In 2013 Q2, the Thai economy was likely to 
expand from the same period last year, but at a 
slower rate compared to the previous quarter, owing mainly to a slowdown in private consumption. At the 
same time, investment and exports contracted 
slightly on the back of slower global economic 
recovery. This was consis tent with manufacturing 
production which was expec ted to contract due 
mainly to the decline in export-oriented production. 
The contraction was also owed to some transitory 
                                                        
3/ Economic indicators used in assessing the outlook for 2013 Q2 
were produced by the Bank of Thailand, except data on the 
Manufacturing Production Inde x and capacity utilization 
rate, which were provided by  the Office of Industrial 
Economics. The number of t ourists and occupancy rate 
were, in part, compil ed by the Tourism Authority of Thailand. 
Data on the labor market were obtained by the National Statistical Office. The governm ent expenditure data were 
provided by the Comptroller General’s Department, and 
compiled by the Fiscal Policy Office, Ministry of Finance. 
The economic outlook was obtained from the 
Economic/Business Information Exchange Program 
between the Bank of Thailand and the business sector. Monetary Policy Report July 2013                                       33 factors, namely temporary supply shortages and a 
decline in production in some industries as a result of 
their cooperative efforts to  reduce energy usage in 
April. Meanwhile, the servic es sector was expected to 
expand favorably. 
Manufacturing production  in the second 
quarter was expected to contract from the same period last year, mainly stemming from the decline in 
export-oriented production (Chart 2.8) . Production of 
hard disk drives and integrated circuits and parts declined on the back of weak external demand 
despite its slow recovery. Furthermore, the frozen 
seafood industry also decreased due to shrimp shortages following the disease outbreak which 
protracted since the end of last year. Overall 
production for domestic demand also contracted. However, the contraction was in part a result of lower 
petroleum production due to cl osures of refineries for 
maintenance in the latter part of the quarter. In addition, a number of industries reduced production 
in April to comply with the energy reduction policy. 
Nevertheless, the automobile industry was expected to continue to expand, although slowing down 
somewhat compared to the previous quarter as 
deliveries of cars under the first-car tax rebate scheme were nearly filled. The decline in overall 
manufacturing production led to a lower capacity 
utilization rate than the same period last year (Chart 
2.9).  
The services sector  in the second quarter 
was expected to expand well from the same period last year, despite some deceleration when compared 
to the previous quarter. Trade and transportation 
sectors were expected to moderate following a slowdown in economic acti vity both in private 
spending and manufacturing production. Meanwhile, 
the hotel and restaurant sector continued to grow strongly, as reflected by  the number of tourists, -60-300306090

May which continued to increas e. This led to a higher 
hotel occupancy rate when compared to the same 
period last year (Chart 2.10) . The construction sector 
should expand at a slower rate in line with private 
investment in construction  and constraints from labor 
shortages and increasing costs.  
Agricultural production  in the second 
quarter was likely to expand only slightly from the 
same period last year despite the anticipation of an increase in rubber and palm oil outputs following 
expansion in the planting area. This was due to a 
decline in rice output as a result of unfavorable water 
supply and weather conditi ons. A high base effect 
should also be noted as rice output in the same 
period last year was much higher than usual due to an increase in rice cultivation to compensate for 
those damaged by the previous year’s  floods.              
Although production was likely to slow down 
during this quarter, firms retained their workers 
thanks to the tight labor market  condition 
experienced in the past periods. The Business Sentiment Survey also revealed that most firms 
desired to hire more workers, but was faced with 
recruiting difficulties. As a result, the unemployment rate in this quarter was likel y to be low, similar to the 
level recorded in the same period last year (Chart 
2.11).  However, a slowdown in production and 
impacts from the nationwide minimum wage hike to 
300 baht per day led entrepreneurs outside the 
agricultural sector to reduce overtime hours in order to mitigate the impact from rising costs. This was 
reflected in the declining number of non-farm workers 
working overtime which was observed since the beginning of the year.

consumption was expected to slow down from the 
same period last year. Exports were likely to recover 
slowly following still fragile external demand. Private 
investment contracted slightly, while public investment 
continued to lend support  to economic growth. 
Private consumption  was expected to 
moderate from the same peri od last year, as reflected 
by a declining trend of the Private Consumption Index 
in April and May (Chart 2.12) . This was attributable in 
part to last year’s high base when large automobile 
manufacturers returned to full capacity production 
last year after the floods, as well as the near complete delivery of automobiles under the first-car 
tax rebate scheme. In additi on, farm income declined 
in line with prices of rice and rubber. Nevertheless, there remained supporting factors for consumption 
including high employment and non-farm income, as 
well as accommodative m onetary conditions which 
would help support spending.  
Private investment  was expected to decline 
from the same period last year, as reflected by the downward trend of the Private Investment Index in April 
and May (Chart 2.13) . This was partly due to a high 
base effect in the previous year following investment in machinery and equipment after they were promptly 
imported by manufacturers to replace those damaged 
by the flood. In additi on, the slowing domestic 
economy combined with fragile external demand 
reduced the need for imm ediate investment and led 
some manufacturers to dela y their investment plans. 
Nonetheless, the private se ctor still had investment 
plans in the pipeline. This included investments for 
manual labor replacement in response to labor 
shortages and for production process restructuring to 
enhance efficiency as well as to accommodate 
anticipated higher domes tic and foreign demand 
following a closer regional economic integration -4-2024681012

was consistent with the op inions expressed by most 
entrepreneurs under the Business Liaison Program 
between the Bank of Thailand and the business sector, and was reflected by the high level of 
applications and issuance of  investment promotion 
certificates by the Board of  Investment, as well as 
strong business confidence.   
Exports of goods were expected to recover 
slowly from the same period last year as the repercussions from the global economic crisis 
remained (Chart 2.14) . Exports of key manufacturing 
products in nearly all product categories, with the exception of automobiles, were expected to slow 
down. Moreover, exports of fishery and agricultural 
products were likely to moderate due to shrimp supply shortages for fr ozen seafood production and a 
decline in rice exports following deteriorating price 
competitiveness. Nevertheless, exports of services  
were expected to conti nue improving from the 
previous quarter, prompted by an increase in foreign 
tourists from almost all regions, in particular those 
from Russia and China.    
Imports of goods were likely to decelerate 
from the same period last year (Chart 2.15)  
stemming from a slowdown in capital goods imports 
following the private invest ment trend. In addition, 
imports of raw materials and intermediate goods moderated in line with manufacturing production, 
while imports of consumer goods were likely to slow 
in line with private spending. Meanwhile, imports of 
services  were expected to expand at a rate similar to 
that in the previous quarter, due to travel 
expenditures which increased in tandem with the number of Thais travelling abroad. However, freight 
payments declined in tandem with import volume.

the same period last year. This was a result of 
continuous budget disbur sements which were 
consistent with the gover nment’s disbursement plan  
(Chart 2.16) . Furthermore, local government expenditures 
were likely to increase following large budget 
allocations in the previ ous periods. Nevertheless, 
non-budgetary expenditures remained low due to a 
delay in the contractor sele ction process for the water 
management projects.  
In summary, the Thai economy in 2013 Q2 
was expected to moderate fr om the previous quarter 
owing both to tepid dom estic demand and exports, 
consistent with the sl owdown in manufacturing 
production. 
2.3 Costs and prices  
 Inflation 
Headline inflation in 2013 Q2 stood at 2.32 
percent, declining from 3.09 percent in the previous 
quarter (Chart 2.17)  due to a slowdown in energy 
prices and core inflation.  Energy prices in 2013 Q2 
increased year-on-year by merely 4.60 percent, 
decelerating considerably from 8.76 percent observed 
in the previous quarter. The slowdown was prompted by a fall in domestic retail oil prices following world 
crude oil prices which was on a decline in accordance 
with the fragile global economic recovery. 
Meanwhile, prices of raw food rose year-on-
year by 6.60 percent, increasing slightly from 6.08 
percent in the previous quarter due to an increase in prices of vegetables and fr uits, meat, poultry, aquatic 
animals and eggs following extremely hot weather 
conditions which led to low outputs.

Core inflation in 2013 Q2 stood at 1.00 
percent, slowing down c ontinuously from 1.47 
percent in the previous quarter (Chart 2.18)  owing 
mainly to low production costs, as well as sluggish domestic demand and high market  competition. This 
resulted in limited pass-through of costs to prices of 
goods and services, as reflec ted by a contraction in 
the Core Consumer Price Index on a quarter-on-
quarter, seasonally  adjusted basis (Table 2.2).  
Production cost conditions Costs of production remained low overall, as 
reflected by an increase in  the Producer Price Index 
of 0.4 percent in 2013 Q2, a slight increase from 0.1 
percent in the previous quarter (Chart 2.19). This 
followed the acceleration in the price of agricultural 
products, mainly vegetables and fruits. However, the 
price of manufactured pr oducts contracted further 
owing to a decline in the pr ice of petroleum products 
in line with world crude oil prices. At the same time, the price of rubber and pl astic products decreased 
following a continuous decline in purchases by China, 
the world’s largest buyer of rubber.  -2-101234

Inflationary pressure in the short-term was 
likely to rise from the current level but would remain 
low, mainly due to the s light increase in domestic 
demand pressure, while costs and inflation 
expectations remained stable.    
(1) Demand pressure was likely to increase 
slightly following gradual improvements in domestic 
demand. At the same time, exports were expected to 
gradually recover on the back of trading partners’ economic recovery. Overa ll, the output gap remained 
close to zero in 2013 Q4, reflecting low inflationary 
pressure.  
(2) Going forward, cost pressure was likely to 
remain stable compared to the current level, in 
tandem with world prices of crude oil and commodities. The w eaker baht would not have much 
effect on domestic energy cost pressure as the 
government was expected to maintain domestic retail diesel prices. In addition, upward adjustment to the LPG 
price, which would take e ffect in September 2013, was 
expected to have minimal impact on cost pressure as the price adjustment woul d be done at a gradual pace. 
(3) Inflation expectations remained stable, as 
reflected by the 12-month- ahead inflation expectations 
in May 2013 which remained close to that of the 
previous month at 3.5 percent (Chart 2.20).

Source: Bank of Thailand’s Business Sentiment SurveyShare Percent40   Monetary Policy Report  July 2013  Labor constraints  and economic growth  
.During the past several years, t he Thai labor market has been tight ening , with 
unemployment rate standing at  0.9 percent in April 2013 , the lowest level amongst Asian 
countries.  Tight labor market has been  one of the key structural constraint s facing the Thai  
econom y, and an important impediment to businesses in Thailand . This  is in line with 
business  survey results which found that labor recruitment  has become  increasing ly difficult in 
the past 2 -3 years. Labor supply constraint is thus an often -cited problem among businesses . 
However, a nother important issue of the Thai labor market  that should also be addressed  
concurrently is the slow productivity growth of Thai labor.  
Impact on  Thailand’s  economic growth  
The Thai economy has been  
driven by both  employment and 
productivity  growth  (Chart 1) . However, 
since  the Asian financial crisis in 1997 , 
Thai economic growth  slowed  down  
considerably as a result of lower  growth 
in both the employment  and productivity.  
With regard to low employment  
growth , during 2000 -2010 , the 
employment  grew on average by  1.9 
percent per year, compared to 2.4 
percent pe r year during 1986 -1996. This 
was mainly due to a continuous drop in 
the fertility rate.  Most recently, the 
average number of children  born to  one 
female during her  reproductive years is 1.6 children, resulting in low working -age population  
growth . Furthermore, Thailand is one of the first nations to become an aging society in 
ASEAN.  Given these factors together with the fact that Thailand’s  labor participation rate is 
already quite high, standing at 71 percent of total  labor  force  in 2012, further labor force 
expansion will likely  be difficult.

growth fell from 2.86 prior to the 1997 crisis to a mere  1.56 in the period after the crisis . This 
shows that Thai labor productivity has slowed down by  more  than the rate of employment  
growth slowdown , which  is the main factor weighing on  economic growth. In addition, wh en 
compared to other countries (Chart 2) , it was found that in the decade following the Asian 
crisis, economic growth from labor productivity and employment  slowed in nearly every  
countr y. Interestingly, however, the slowdown  in employment  was not much  different among 
these countries  (with  the ex ception of Singapore  where employment  accelerated from the 
government ’s policy), while the rate of deceleration  in productivity growth differed , with the 
sharpest slowdown in the case of Thailand.  
What accounts  for slow productivity growth  
Labor p roductivity in 
Thailand slowed down 
considerably due to (1) labor 
reallocation  from high 
productivity sectors to low 
productivity  sectors .1/ In the 
period leading up to the Asian 
crisis, Thai labor continuously 
moved away from the 
agricultural sector, which had 
low productivity, to  the 
manufacturing and services  
sectors , which had higher 
productivity. Employment  in 
the agricultural sector  declined  
from approximately 20 million 
in 1990 to approximately 14 
million in 2000 (Chart 3) . As a 
result , this pattern of labor 
reallocation  had contributed  
as a key driver of productivity 
growth  in Thailand  (Chart 4) . 
However, more recently, th is 
driver  became  weakened  and 
eventually reversed  its 
direction . Its contribution  to 
productivity growth turned 
negat ive, particularly during 
2011 -2012 when up to 
700,000 people moved into 
                                                 
1/  Following the calculation used in the study by Sra Chuenchoksan and Don Nakornthab , 2008 , and Nicholas Oulton and 
Sylaja Srinivasan, 2005 , which calculated the weighted average of each sector in the economy  and accounted for the  
effect of labor reallocation  on overall productivity.

price s in both  domestic and global markets . (2) Slower capital accumulation  (Table 1) . In 
2008 -2011, the growth rate of total capital to labor  ratio fell to a mere 1.4 percent compared to 
8.5 percent before the Asian crisis. In part, this was because many industries that relied 
heavily on l abor were able to  continue  their businesses on the ba ck of unskilled migrant labor 
supply from neighboring countries. These industries  therefore lacked the motivation to invest, 
for example , to replace manual labor with machine ries or to move up the value chain to a  
more complex and more value -added  producti on. Low investment in terms of both quantity 
and quality led to a significant slowdown  in productivity growth from capital deepening, which 
declined from 4.3 percent in 1987 -1996 to 1.2 percent in 2009 -2011.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In conclusion, labor  constraint problem s aro se from both the shortage  of labor and a 
slowdown in labor productivity. This  led to a declin e in Thailand’s potential economic  growth in 
recent years , and the problems  could intensify going forward . Resolution to t his structural 
problem will take t ime and must take into consideration the costs and benefits in the short and 
long term . Short -term m easures to address this  problem , such as expanding  the number  of 
immigrant  labor s so as  to reduce constraints in the manufacturing sector in the short  run, 
without controlling for the type of work  allowed , could in turn  reduce businesses’  motivation to 
invest  to increase  their potential  in the long term. More importantly , measures  that will 
encourage reallocation of  existing labor to highly productive sectors  should be fostered . This 
can be  achieved  by re moving  measures that may distort  returns in each economic sector, 
while implement ing measures that promote  continuous  restructuring of production  as well as  
invest ing in public infrastructure to enhance  private investment  capacity .

3.1 Financial markets 
Money market rates adjusted downwards in 
line with the policy interest rate. Government bond 
yields were somewhat volatile owing to foreign 
investors’ sales as well as market expectation of a decrease in the policy interest rate at the May 29, 
2013 Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting. 
Money and bond markets 
In April and May of this year, short-term 
money market rates remained stable and close to the policy interest rate, before adjusting downwards in 
line with the MPC’s decision to cut the policy interest 
rate from 2.75 to 2.50 perc ent per annum at the May 
29, 2913 meeting. The over night interbank lending Thailand’s overall economic and fina ncial stability continued to be 
well maintained. Money market inte rest rates adjusted downwards in 
tandem with the policy interest rate . Meanwhile, stability in financial 
institutions and corporate sectors re mained intact, while signs of over- 
expansion in the real estate  sector began to dissipate.  
Nonetheless, financial market s and households became more 
fragile. The Stock Exchange of Thailand Index and the Thai baht became significantly more volatile during this period following the trend in global 
markets which was driven in part by market anticipati on of a sooner-than-
expected tapering of the US quantitative easing meas ures. With regard to 
the household sector, debt burden continued to  rise as a result of the strong 
pace of househould debt expansion in the previous period. As for the 
banking sector, high competition fo r deposits between commercial banks 
and Specialized Financial Inst itutions (SFIs) in ant icipation of loan demand 
expansion and the funding needs rela ted to the government’s large 
investment projects coul d negatively impact banks’ liquidity in the next 
periods.

trended downwards throughout the quarter, following 
the policy rate cut, to reach 2.53 percent at the end of 
June. Subsequently, at the July 9-10, 2013 meeting, 
the MPC decided to maintain the policy interest rate 
at 2.50 percent per annum, causing short-term interest rates on July 10, 2013 to remain close to the 
2013 Q2 end level (Chart 3.1) .  
Short-term government bond yields in 2013 Q2 
edged lower in line with the policy interest rate and an 
increase in demand by both domestic and foreign 
investors. Moreover, medium to long-term government bond yields trended down throughout April and the 
first half of May along with movements in the US 
government bond market which continued to be dictated by fragile confidenc e in the global financial 
markets, foreign investors’ portfolio rebalancing to 
longer-term government bonds, and market expectation of a decrease in th e policy interest rate at 
the May 29, 2013 MPC meeti ng. For the rest of the 
quarter, however, medium to long-term government bond yields rose significantly in tandem with an 
increase in the US governm ent bond yield, owing to 
foreign investors’ sales that were driven by an anticipation of a sooner-than-expected tapering of the 
US quantitative easi ng measures. The shift in risk 
appetite also led to an increas e in volatility during this 
period (Chart 3.2) .

index was seen to rise, peaking at 1,643.43 on May

the rest of the quarter, the SET index declined to 
stand at 1,364.09 on June 24, 2013. This was due mainly to the continued sell- offs by foreign investors 2.402.602.803.003.203.403.603.804.00

Key risks to be monitored in the periods

trend of the Chinese economy,  which could result in

At the end of 2013 Q2, the Thai baht stood

(Chart 3.4).  The volatility of the Thai baht 
increased markedly during this period, as at the beginning of the quarter the Thai baht was still 
on its appreciating trend that began since the 
start of the year . The appreciation during the earlier 
period was attributable to several factors including 
(1) Thailand’s strong economic fundamentals relative 
to those of regional and advanced economies,

Japan’s announcement of additional stimulus 
measures, and (3) exporters’ sales of US dollars to 
hedge against foreign exchange risks. Together, these factors moved the Thai baht to peak at 28.61 
baht per US dollar on April 19, 2013. 
Towards the end of April, however, the 
Thai baht began to reverse its direction. The 
depreciation that followed could be viewed in part 
as a market correction after the currency had appreciated substantially si nce the beginning of the 
year. This was reinforced by investors’ anxiety 
regarding a possible implem entation of capital flow 
management measures to curb the rapid 
appreciation. In addition, the lower-than-expected 
GDP in 2013 Q1 also raised concerns about the Thai economic outlook and possible credit rating 
downgrade, which subs equently caused foreign 
portfolio investments to slow down. 
From the end of May to the start of June, 
the Thai baht depreciated sharply  as a result of 
investors’ anticipation of a sooner-than-expected 
unwinding of the US quantit ative easing measures, 
given clearer signs of US economic recovery. Capital 
flows began to pour out of emerging market economies and into the US and other advanced 
economies. As such, the Thai baht along with 
regional currencies depreciated sharply and continued trending downwards through the end of the 
quarter. In the second quarter, the Thai baht 
averaged at 29.90 baht per US dollar and stood at 31.02 baht per US dollar at the end of the quarter, 
depreciating by 8.42 percent from the strongest level 
recorded on April 19, 2013. 
The Nominal Effective Exchange Rate  
(NEER) averaged at 109.91 in 2013 Q2, depreciating 
by 1.73 percent from the pr evious quarter’s average. 
In mid-April, the NEER rose  to its strongest level due Monetary Policy Report  July 2013                    47 mostly to the substantial weakening of the Japanese 
yen. Afterwards, the NEER started to depreciate in 
line with regional economies owing to the 
strengthening of major curr encies, namely, the US 
dollar, the euro, as well as the Chinese renminbi, 
following an improvement in the global economic 
outlook. Meanwhile, the Real Effective Exchange 
Rate (REER)  averaged at 111.66 in May,  
appreciating by 1.08 percent  from the end of the 
previous quarter , in line with the NEER during the 
same period (Chart 3.5) .  
3.2 Financial institutions 
In 2013 Q2, deposit and lending rates of the 
four largest commercial banks remained unchanged 
from the previous quarter partly due to high 
competition for deposits between commercial banks 
and SFIs. This was reflected in part by continued 
releases of special depos it campaigns paying higher 
interest rates than those of  normal time deposits in 
order to meet loan demand and the funding needs 
related to the government’s large-scale investment 
projects. As a result, deposit s of financial institutions 
accelerated from the previous quarter. Meanwhile, 
private credits slowed down slightly, both in the 
consumer and corporate loan components.  
 Interest rates, credits and deposits  
Commercial banks’ deposit rates in 2013 Q2 
decreased in line with the policy interest rate with 
small- and medium-sized banks responsible for most

deposit products which paid higher interest rates 
than those of normal time deposits. 
Interest rates on the 12-month deposits of 
the four largest commercial banks2/, however, 
remained unchanged from the previous quarter, 
standing at 2.40 percent per annum, owing to high competition for deposits in ant icipation of private loan 
demand expansion and the funding needs under the 
government’s large-scale investment projects. 
Meanwhile, the average MLR of the four 
largest commercial banks remained unchanged from 
the previous quarter at 7.00 percent per annum.  
Private credits at end-May 2013 grew at 12.0 
percent from the same peri od last year, decelerating 
from 14.0 percent in the previous quarter (Chart 3.6) . 
The slowdown in private credits was attributed to 
both household and corporate loans. Although 
consumer loans, especially  auto leasings and other 
personal loans
3/, expanded at a high level, it was 
likely to slow down as consumers became more 
cautious in their spending behavior after having paid 
large sums previously to take advantage of the first-
car tax rebate scheme. Meanwhile, corporate loans 
slowed down in line with private investment. 
Deposits and bills of exchange (B/E) at end-
May 2013 expanded at 11.9 percent from the same 
period last year, accelerati ng from 9.6 percent in the 
pervious quarter. The increase in deposits was 
induced in part by commercial banks’ and SFIs’ 
continued releases of special deposit campaigns that 
paid attractive interest ra tes in order to mobilize

funding needs related to the government’s large-
scale infrastructure invest ment projects. The fierce 
competition for deposits could tighten commercial 
banks’ liquidity in the periods ahead. 
Stability of financial institutions  
The overall stability of fi nancial institutions in 
2013 Q2 remained sound as reflected by strong 
profitability, high capi tal adequacy ratio and low 
delinquency and NPL ratio.  
Commercial banks continued to pose strong 
profitability in 2013 Q1 wher eby net profit stood at 
52.3 billion baht, increasing from 39.2 billion baht recorded in the previous quarter (Table 3.1) .  
Moreover, the ratio of capital adequacy remained 
high. The implementation of Basel III at the beginning of the year only caused a small impact on 
commercial banks’ capital adequacy ratio. In this 
regard, the ratio of capital adequacy stood at 16.1 percent in April 2013, increasing from 15.9 percent in 
March. With regard to liquidity, the loan to deposit 
and B/E ratio edged up from 93.1 percent at the end of 2012 Q4 to 93.4 percent  at the end of 2013 Q1, 
signaling a slight tightening in commercial banks’ 
liquidity. Nonetheless, loan quality in the banking 
system remained sound as  reflected by the 
delinquency and NPL ratios of  private credits which 
continued to stabilize at a low level of 5.3 percent 
(Chart 3.7) .  
Looking ahead, loan quality would need to be 
monitored closely given t he potential impact of the 
Thai economic slowdown on corporates’ and 
households’ debt servicing abilities.

Stability in non-financial sectors remained 
intact overall. Household income and employment were high, while corporate enjoyed strong profitability. However, ke y risks that warranted 
monitoring in the next periods included the weakening of economic outl ook which could affect 
debt servicing ability of  households as well as 
corporate performance.  
Household sector 
Stability of the household sector remained 
sound, with high levels  of employment and 
household income. However, households’ debt servicing ability would still require close monitoring 
due to rising debt burden.  
Households’ income and employment 
remained high, with rising average income in both farm and non-farm sectors (Chart 3.8) . Employment 
conditions remained favorabl e, as reflected by the 
low unemployment rate of 0.9 percent in April 2013. 
Moreover, debt servicing ability of households remained satisfactory, as reflected by a low NPL ratio which edged up only marginally from 4.7 percent at the end of 2012 to  4.9 percent at the end 
of 2013 Q1. Moreover, households’ liquidity improved slightly, as reflected by a decline in the ratio of debt 
to financial assets from 46. 4 percent at the end of 
2012 to 46.0 percent at the end of 2013 Q1  
(Chart 3.9) . 
Nonetheless, the sharp acceleration in 
consumer loan growth in previous periods led to an increase in households’ debt  burden. Information 
from the Household Socio Economic Survey of 2013 
Q1 that was conducted by the National Statistical 
Office (calculated by the Bank of Thailand) showed that the overall ratio of households’ average monthly 100110120130140150160

increasing from 29.6 percent in 2011 (Chart 3.10).   
In this light, households’ debt servicing ability, 
especially for low income households, warranted 
close monitoring as the situation could become 
deteriorate should the Thai  economy weaken further. 
Corporate sector 
Corporate profitability in 2013 Q1 improved 
from the previous quarter regardless of the impact of 
the slowdown of global as well as domestic demand which had led to persisting decline in manufacturing 
sales. Lower costs of raw material imports and a significant improvement in  the hotel and restaurant 
sector were among key factors that contributed positively to the overall corporate profitability. 
Corporate profitability in 2013 Q1 increased, 
especially in the manufactu ring sector where profit 
started to improve even though manufacturing sales were still on a decline due to the slow global recovery (Chart 3.11)  and the softening of domestic 
demand. In this regard, lower costs of raw material imports, owing partly to the decrease in world crude oil price as well as the stronger Thai baht, lent support to favorable firm profitability. The overall 
operating profit margin (OPM) increased from 5.8 percent in the previous quar ter to 6.3 percent this 
quarter. Moreover, the hotel and restaurant sector saw a significant improvem ent from the previous 
quarter owing to the record high number of overseas tourists (Chart 3.12) . However, the real estate sector 
which expanded strongly in 2012 Q4 started to slow down as firms experienced labor shortages and limitations in finding su itable locations for new 
condominium projects. As a re sult, profitability of the 
real estate sector declined this quarter. 
For the next periods, risk factors that must be 
monitored included uncert ainty of the global 
economy, namely the fragile European economic recovery and the slowdown of the Chinese economy, 8090100110120

Real estate sector The real estate sector in 2013 Q2 slowed 
down from the previous quarter, particularly in condominiums. Nonetheless, overall stability in the 
real estate sector remained intact. The problem of labor shortages was a main risk factor to monitor as it could weigh importantly on future developments of 
the real estate sector.  
During 2013 Q2, the overall real estate 
sector slowed down from the previous quarter in both demand and supply. The slowdown in demand was reflected by the number of  housing registrations in 
Bangkok and its vicinity, in particular condominiums, 
that decreased c ontinuously from last quarter (Chart 
3.13) . On the supply side, real estate firms began to 
postpone new openings partly as  a result of labor 
shortages in the building and construction sector.  
In addition, finding suitable site for condominium development was becoming more difficult. As a result, new openings of condominiums in May 2013 declined. Meanwhile, openings  of low-rise residential 
units continued to increase after the waiting period to assess the flood situation in the previous year ended (Chart 3.14) . 
Regarding debt-servicing  ability pertaining to 
the real estate sector , although housing prices 
continued to rise, household income had also been increasing. This resulted in the ratio of housing 
prices to income of mortgage borrowers to remain stable at 3.4, close to t he past five-year average of 
3.2. Moreover, in 2013 Q2, commercial banks began to tighten their credit standards for housing loans after some easing in the first quarter of the year. This 0246810

2012 2013Monetary Policy Report  July 2013                    53 was reflected by the debt service coverage ratio 
(DSCR) in May of 5.1, which was higher than the previous five-year’s average of 4.4 (Chart 3.15) . 
Overall, stability remained sound, and signs of 
overheating in real estate markets in major provinces began to dissipate. In addition, a survey of real estate firms revealed that a majority of firms had in place protection measures against speculation such as charging fees for name changes on the preemption certificate and imposing limit s for the number of rooms 
a customer can buy in a popular project. Nonetheless, speculative activities were still present in some areas, and this issue must be continuously monitored along with the impact of labor shortage problem on the real 
estate sector going forward. 
Fiscal sector Financial position of the fiscal sector remained 
sound. The government’s spending plan under the water management projects would continue to be monitored as it could be further delayed. Fiscal 
liabilities were likely to increase in the next periods.  
Stability of the fiscal sector was well 
maintained overall, as reflec ted by the ratio of public 
debt to GDP at the end of March 2013 of 44.2 percent, which remained close to the previous quarter’s level (Chart 3.16) . Nonetheless, the 
government’s spending plan, in particular the water management projects could be further delayed after the Administrative Court ruled that a public hearing must be sought in order to proceed, and hence warranted close monitoring.  Fiscal liabilities could 
also increase in the next periods stemming from government spending, in particular from the rice pledging scheme, as well as borrowings to finance 
infrastructure development of the transportation network.  0123456

 56   Monetary Policy Report July 2013  Why capital flows have become more volatile 
In the aftermath of the global crisis, 
many emerging market economies, including Thailand, have been experiencing higher capital flow volatility (Chart 1) . The increase 
in volatility has been particularly striking during the past three months. At the beginning of the year, emerging market economies were dealing with the large influx of capital inflows led by relatively more promising growth outlook given uncertainties regarding the economic recovery of major economies. In addition, the Bank of Japan’s announcement of an aggressive expansion of quantitative easing program flagged another trigger event driving more inflows into emerging markets. Beginning in May, capital flows suddenly reversed th eir earlier di rection upon 
improvements in US economic data along with an anticipation of a sooner-than-expected QE tapering as well as the recent weakening of Thai economic outlook. In the case of Thailand, reversal of flows together with changing investors’ sentiment has caused the Thai baht to so far depreciate by more than 1 percent from the beginning of the year, compared with the peak of 6 percent appreciation at end-April. The Thai baht volatility
1/ has also risen to 7.22 percent in June compared to a mere 2.06 percent at the end of last year.  
This trend of increasingly more rapid capital flows in and out of a country could threaten the 
country’s financial and exchange rate stability. It is also interesting to note the mounting synchronicity of capital flows and exchange rates across emerging markets, which implies greater risk of systemic disruption should something go wrong. This box shades light on four potential driving forces behind the more volatile and synchronized capital flows, and how they interact with and reinforce one another, as follows.  
(1) More frequent global shocks . This owed to the growing interconnectedness of world 
economy, more complex technology, the buildup of structural imbalances and fragility especially in major economies along with heightened uncertainties in the aftermath of the global crisis. These factors have contributed to greater sensitivity of investors to new developments in global economy, and thereby resulting in more frequent, widespread global shocks.
2/ A study by Forbes (2012)3/ confirmed that global 
factors have become more important determinants of capital flow volatility in the recent period. 
(2) The increase in the size of capital flows relative to the size of an economy and their more 
procyclical behavior. Capital account liberalization in many countries coupled with advancements in 
communication and technology have resulted in lower international transaction costs, which led to larger capital flows over time. On the other hand, the ease of investment and more rapid spread of news have also led to greater sensitivity of capital flows to both positive and negative economic developments.  
On the procyclicality, capital inflows to emerging market economies have generally been found 
to establish procyclical behavior—plentiful in good times and scarce in bad times. Such behavior can lead to excessive volatiity in the recipient economy. Furthermore, recent data reveals that the procyclicality of capital flows, measured by the difference between the size of foreign flows during high-growth and low-growth periods, has increased in the case of Thailand as well as other Asian economies (Table 1) . 
                                                 
1/  Calculated using the exponentially weighted moving average of daily changes of the exchange rate (annualized).  
2/  For these reasons, the OECD assessed that the global economy would face more frequent global shocks that can be 
originated from natural disasters, tec hnological failures, epidemics, or other ec onomic crises. Refer to “Future Global 
Shocks, Improving Risk Governance”, OECD Reviews of Risk Management Policies (2011), for further details.

Asia2/Monetary Policy Report July 2013  57 (3) More intense shock transmission  
as a result of an increase in direct and indirect global connectivity via trade, investment, financial institutions and market expectations. While trade and investment linkages  are nothing 
new, they have recently intensified especially after large economies such as China, Russia, and India opened up more to cross-border trade and investment, along with the increasing exploitation of global supply chains.   
A transmission channel that has been 
highlighted more recently is the investor 
expectations channel . Through this channel, 
shock in one country, especially one that is highly connected with others, can affect the economic outlook re-assessment of other countries according to the “Wake-up Calls” hypothesis
4/. The response of capital flows to  
shifts in expectations can front run real events, leading to self-fulfilling effects which could materialize more rapidly than that through traditional trade and investment channels. Moreover, a shift in expectations tends to occur simultaneously in countries with similar economic fundamentals, a so-called coordinated panic.

Together, these factors have resulted in greater business cycle synchronicity, as reflected by 
higher correlation between regional economies, including Thailand, and major economies since the onset of the global crisis in 2008 (Table 2) . The most recent case in point was when the Fed signaled a 
possibility of a sooner-than-expected QE unwinding which happened to coincide with the slowdown of the Chinese economy. The subsequent market reactions illustrate how the front-running of investor expectations about possible repercussions on other economies could result in such great volatility in financial markets, particularly in terms of sudden outflows from Asian and Latin American economies.   
(4) Limited monetary and fiscal policy space and tight credit conditions . The zero-bound 
interest rates and high public debt, particularly in major economies, act to amplify the effect of the expectations channel. With limitations on policy tools to stabilize growth, investors would tend to anticipate the economic impact of shocks to be more severe. In addition, the tight credit condition in many countries stemmed from problems in the financial sector could further impair the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission.  
In sum, the aforementioned factors together have resulted in higher volatility of capital flows in 
and out of emerging market economies, including Thailand. This highlights the role of global factors as increasingly more important drivers of these flows, especially through the psychological effect during the time of heightened uncertainty . Since these factors are sometimes beyond the control of national 
authorities, all concerned stakeholders, both public and private, must strive to undertake necessary adjustments to strengthen the resiliency of the economy to cushion against greater volatility brought about by the increasing global interconnectedness.

Large commercial banks have yet to adjus t deposit and lending rates following the 
policy interest rate cut on May 29, 2013. A key reason for commercial banks’ decision to 
postpone rate adjustment is per sistently high competition for deposits. Understanding the 
sources of deposit competition and its effect on commercial banks’ liquidity, is therefore 
crucial in assessing the effe ctiveness of the monetary po licy transmission mechanism.  
Assessing commercial banks’ liquidity 
The definition of “liquidity ” varies depending on the specific  markets considered. Money 
market liquidity may be assessed by short-term interbank rates which move closely with the 
policy interest rate. On the other hand, liqui dity in the deposit and lending markets, while 
influenced by money market liquidity, also depends on demand for deposits and loans, 
availability of loan supply and commercial banks’  business strategies, prevailing degree of 
competition in the banking industry, as well as other factors. Th is article focuses on  liquidity in 
deposit and lending markets from comm ercial banks’ perspectives.  
A basic measure of liquidity  used by many banks is the Loan-to-Deposit Ratio (L/D). 
An increase in the L/D ratio implies a tighteni ng in liquidity as new loan extension exceeds 
mobilized deposits. At the end of May 2013, the L/D including Bills  of Exchange (B/E) ratio of 
all commercial banks stood at 93.3 percent, reflec ting somewhat tighter liquidity compared to 
recent years (Chart 1) . The L/D ratio is a simple and us eful gauge of system-wide liquidity, 
since loans and deposits constitute  a large proportion of financial institutions’ balance sheets. 
At present, loans account for 75 percent of other deposit ory financial institutions’ total assets, 
while deposits account for 65 per cent of total liabilities. 
The aggregate L/D ratio 
however needs not represent 
individual banks’ liquidity, which is influenced by a myriad of factors. 
Deposit competition, business 
expansion plans, internal liquidity management policy and loan targets 
for example all have an impact on 
each institution’s liquidity and its outlook. While macro developments 
such as behavioral shift in savers’ 
demand for deposits or the extent of disintermediation can affect the 
system’s overall liquidity, other micro 
factors such as deposit competition 
result in a re-distribution of liquidity within  the system–seemingly a ze ro-sum game. However, 
shocks to liquidity distribution could still induce fi nancial institutions to in tensify competition for 
deposits, for example by encour aging those short in deposit to  engage in active mobilization 
policy. These behavioral shifts can ultimately affect total deposit and therefore market-wide 
liquidity.

 Financial institutions have been fervently competing for deposits in recent years, 
reflected in part by continued releases of special deposit ca mpaigns paying higher interest 
rates than those of normal time deposits. Banks’  onerous efforts to defend their market shares 
stem mainly from the following factors : (1) most institutions pl an to expand lending at a 
reasonable pace, and thus are prepared to mainta in their deposit base ev en at higher costs; 
(2) banks are somewhat concerned that the funding needs related to large-scale public 
investment projects could tri gger another round of deposit competit ion, especially if SFIs were 
to be involved; and (3) higher liquidity dispersi on among financial institut ions along with their 
different business strategies have played a par t in intensifying competition for deposit.  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
Financial institutions that o ffer special deposit pr oducts, especially thos e with plenty of 
liquid assets, are incurring short-term costs as  these products typically pay higher interest 
rates than short-term money market rates (close  to policy interest rate at 2.50 percent)  
that these banks earn from their liquid investment (Chart 2) . The willingness to bear these 
short-term costs implies that these banks expec t to lend out credits at  a reasonably high pace. 
Over the past two years, the spread betw een the policy interest rates and the average 
effective deposit rates has indeed narrowed in line with the high pace of credit growth.  
A recent survey also indicates that most  commercial banks are targeting double-digit loan 
growth for this year (Chart 3) .

Bangkok Bank : 15 month fixed deposit, minimum 200,000 bahtBank60   Monetary Policy Report  July 2013   SFIs’ growth strategies remain another  important issue that commercial banks 
consider in assessing their liquidity outlook. Given the government’s plan to undertake large 
infrastructural projects, including the wa ter management projects  and the 2 trillion baht 
infrastructure project, commerc ial banks are concerned about potent ial competition from SFIs 
to mobillize deposits in order to meet public demand for funds. Commercial banks have 
stepped up effort to retain t heir deposit base as a result. 
Lastly, business strategies of 
each individual commercial bank have 
also affected the competition 
landscape. During t he past couple of 
years, small and medium-sized 
commercial banks have been active in 
extending loans, particularly to auto leasing sector, partly as a result of the 
government’s first-car tax rebate 
scheme. The resulting higher liquidity dispersion (Chart 4)  has fuelled 
greater competition for deposits 
amongst commercial banks, as swings in liquidi ty encourages those 
losing deposits to push and regain 
market share. Among larger commercial banks themselves, 
differences in business plans in terms 
of target growth and strategic loan market segments for example, also 
promote fierce competition. 
Summary The MPC’s decision to lower 
the policy interest rate by 0.25 percent 
on May 29, 2013 has signaled a more accommodative stance of monetary 
policy. While the adjustment in 
monetary policy was fully transmitted to the m oney market rates, large commercial banks have 
yet to follow through with reference loan and depos it rates. Anticipating still intense deposit 
competition, banks are therefore reluctant to adjust deposit rates downward. However, currently 
tight liquidity in the deposit mark et does not indicate a lack of liquidity in the money market. 
Rather, commercial banks’ decisions are driven by the desire to defend their deposit base amid 
active plans to extend loans and dynamic competition for mark et share. Thus, in this 
environment, deposit competition is  indicative of robust demand fo r credits as well as banks’ 
willingness to lend, suggesting that financial c onditions remain accommodative for the real 
sector.
