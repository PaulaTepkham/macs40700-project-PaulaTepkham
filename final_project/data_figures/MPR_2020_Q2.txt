Monetary Policy Report  
 
 
The Monetary Policy Report  is prepared quarterly by staff of the 
Bank of Thailand with the approval of the Monetary Policy Committee 
(MPC). It serves two purposes: ( 1) to communicate to the public the  
MPC’s consideration and rationales for the conduct of monetary policy,  
and (2)  to present the latest set of economic and inflation forecasts, based 
on which the monetary policy decisions were made.

Monetary Policy in Thailand  
Monetary Policy Committee  
Under the Bank of Thailand Act, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) comprise s the governor 
and two deputy governors, as well as four distinguished external members representing various 
sectors of the economy , with the aim of ensuring  that monetary policy decisions are effective and 
transparent.  
Monet ary Policy Objective   
The MPC implements monetary policy under the flexible inflation targeting regime. While regarding 
medium–term price stability  as its primary objective, the MPC also aims at supporting sustainable , 
full-potential economic growth and pr eserving financial stability, attributing to long -term price stability  
and economic sustainability  
Monetary Policy Target  
On December  24, 2019, the Cabinet approved the monetary policy target for 2020, which was 
mutually agreed between the MPC  and the Minister of Finance  to set t he headline inflation  within 
the range of 1 –3 percent as the target for the medium -term horizon and for 2020.  
In the event  that average headline inflation in the past 12 months or a forecast of average headline 
inflatio n over  12 months ahead breach es the target  range, the MPC shall send  an open letter to 
the Minister of Finance to explain  reasons  for the breach of the target range,  together with 
measures taken and estimated time to bring inflation back to the target . In addition, the MPC will 
write an additional open letter to the Minister of Finance every six months if average headline 
inflation based on  the above criteria remains outside the target range . 
Monetary Policy Instrument  
The MPC utilizes the 1 -day bilateral repurchase transaction rate as the policy interest rate to signal 
the monetary policy stance.  
Evaluation of Economic Conditions and Forecasts  
The Bank of Thailand takes into account  information from all sources, the macroeconomic model, 
data from each economic sector, as well as surveys  of large enterprises , together with  small and 
medium -sized enterprises from all over the country, and various financial institutions  to ensure that 
economic evaluations and forecasts are accurate and cover all aspe cts, both at the macro and 
micro levels.  
Monetary Policy Communication  
Recognizing the importance of monetary policy communication to the public, the MPC employs  
various  channel s of communication, both in Thai and English, such as (1) organizing a press 
statement at 14 :00 on the day of the Committee meeting, (2) publishing edited minutes of the MPC 
meeting two weeks after the meeting, and (3) publishing the Monetary Policy Report  every quarter  Monetary Policy Report  June 2020                                                                                                                        3 Content

Monetary Policy Conduct in the Second Quarter of 2020  
At the meeting on May 20, 2020, the Monetary Policy Committee voted 4 to 3 to cut the 
policy rate by 0.25 percentage point from 0.75 to 0.50 percent. Three members voted to 
maintain the policy rate at 0.75 percent at this meeting. The Committee viewed that  the Thai 
economy would experience a larger contraction in 2020 than previously assessed due to a more -
severe -than-expected impact of the COVID -19 outbreak and the containment measures 
implemented by governments in many countries including Thailand which l ed to disruptions of 
global economic activities. Moreover, the impacts of the economic contraction on employment and 
financial system vulnerability would be more pronounced. For this reason, most members viewed 
that additional monetary policy accommodation  was necessary to provide an effective and timely 
support to the real economy. However, three members deemed it appropriate to assess the 
effectiveness of the previously implemented financial and credit measures.  On June 24, 2020, 
the Committee voted unani mously to maintain the policy rate at 0.50 percent. At this 
meeting, the Committee assessed that the Thai economy would contract in 2020 more than the 
previous assessment, as the impact of the COVID -19 outbreak turned out more severe than 
expected. However , a gradual recovery was expected in the second half of 2020, when activities 
should begin to rebound in countries that could effectively contain the outbreak, including Thailand. 
The Committee viewed that extra accommodative monetary policy since the begi nning of the year 
as well as the fiscal, financial, and credit measures additionally announced helped alleviate 
adverse impacts and would support the economic recovery after the pandemic subsided.  
Looking ahead, as the environment facing the Thai economy w ould remain highly uncertain , 
the Committee would thus stand ready to use additional appropriate monetary policy tools 
if necessary. Moreover, at the current juncture, the Committee deemed it important to (1) 
efficiently distribute liquidity in the financi al system, which remained ample at the macroeconomic 
level, to businesses and households affected by the pandemic, (2) accelerate debt restructuring 
for borrowers while debt holidays and debt reduction measures were still in place, and (3) 
introduce supply -side policies to support changing economic structure in order to ensure a strong 
recovery in the post -COVID environment. These included, such as, establishing mechanism to 
manage excess production capacity, enhancing high -potential industries, acceleratin g infrastructure  
investments, facilitating upskill of labor, and accelerating reform of government regulations that 
remained obstacles.  
Assessment of the Economic and Financial Outlook as the Basis for Policy Formulation  
1. Global Economy  
The global econom y would severely contract as governments in many countries implemented 
containment measures, causing disruptions to global economic activities. Consequently, this 
severely  affected manufacturing, employment, private consumption, and private investment, as 
well as merchandise exports, which contracted across major advanced economies and Thailand’s 
trading partners in Asia. Thus, most countries especially major advanced economies were 
expected to enter a recession in 2020.  Given such development, the Committe e revised down 
economic growth projections for Thailand’s trading partners to a 4.6 percent contraction 
in 2020, followed by a 4.2 percent expansion in 2021. Also, there remained risks that trading Monetary Policy Report  June 2020                                                                                                                        6 partner economies would underperform the baseline projecti on. These risks included a more 
severe and prolonged outbreak than previously assessed due to an emergence of the second 
wave of the outbreak, greater vulnerabilities in the global financial system owing to increased risks 
of defaults or credit rating down grades among corporates or governments in some countries,  
re-intensifying trade tensions between the U.S. and China, and geopolitical risks such as tensions 
between Mainland China and Hong Kong. On the other hand, there were also possibilities that 
trading partners’ economic growth would outperform the baseline projection if the pandemic ended 
sooner than expected or government stimulus measures worldwide would turn out to be more 
effective than expected.  
Governments in various countries worldwide im plemented additional fiscal and monetary 
measures to alleviate the economic impact of the COVID -19 outbreak. Governments 
introduced series of relief measures aimed particularly at SMEs, households, and employment.  
At the same time, central banks in major advanced economies implemented unconventional 
measures in addition to maintaining ultra -low policy interest rates, while many regional central 
banks eased monetary policy further. Also, a number of central banks introduced measures to 
support stability of the financial markets to ensure sufficient liquidity in their respective markets.  
2. Financial Conditions and Financial Stability  
Overall financial conditions in Thailand became more accommodative as reflected by the 
real policy interest rate, computed usi ng the one -year ahead inflation expectations, that declined 
and remained low compared with those in other emerging markets. In addition, interest rates in 
Thailand’s financial markets declined. Short -term government bond yields fell by more than  
long-term yields, causing the government bond yield curve to steepen. Corporate credit spreads 
stabilized at a high level after having risen at the beginning of the second quarter of 2020, as 
investors were concerned about the profitability outlook of some business es. Meanwhile, 
commercial bank lending rates declined substantially in line with the policy rate and the reduction 
in the Financial Institutions Development Fund (FIDF) contribution. Corporate financing accelerated  
in line with the need for liquidity buffe r among businesses, and also as a result of the government’s 
soft loan programs. With regard to exchange rates, the baht against the U.S. dollar and the 
effective exchange rate appreciated throughout the second quarter, thanks to Thailand’s success 
in cont aining the spread of the virus. Adding to the strength of the baht were sales of the U.S. 
dollars by domestic players, particularly those related to the sales of gold when pandemic 
uncertainties drove up the gold price. Nevertheless, the Committee expresse d concerns over the 
strength of the baht and its potential impacts on economic recovery. The Committee would thus 
closely monitor developments in the foreign exchange markets in order to assess the necessity of 
implementing additional appropriate measures.   
The Thai financial system became more vulnerable due to this year’s contraction of the 
economic outlook in light of the COVID -19 situation, although stability of financial institutions,  
the external sector, and the fiscal sector remained robust. A larger -than-expected contraction 
of the global economy could result in (1) sharp corrections in asset prices in global financial 
markets, (2) defaults by businesses and households in many countries including Thailand, and  
(3) corporate bonds being downgraded to  non-investment grade.  
 
 Monetary Policy Report  June 2020                                                                                                                        7 3. Economic and Inflation Outlook  
The Thai economy would contract by 8.1 percent in 2020, more than previously assessed 
in the previous Monetary Policy Report . Such severe contraction would be observed 
across almost all economic growth components, except public expenditure.  This was due 
to a more -severe -than-expected COVID -19 pandemic and the containment measures implemented  
by governments in many countries including Thailand. This led to temporary disruptions of global 
economic a ctivities especially in the second quarter of 2020. Thailand’s tourism and merchandise 
exports were thus projected to markedly contract, which would weigh on private consumption as 
a result of weakening income and employment. A fall in domestic and externa l demand would also 
lead to a sharp contraction in private investment. However, public expenditure would play an 
important role in supporting the economic recovery in the period ahead. The support would come 
from the reallocation of budget structure for a faster disbursement to remedy and restore the 
economy, as well as an additional liquidity support from the third phase of government relief 
measures to alleviate the impact of COVID -19. Nevertheless, the Thai economy was expected 
to bottom out in the secon d quarter of this year and would gradually recover from the third 
quarter onward,  following the relaxation of containment measures in many countries including 
Thailand. Merchandise exports, tourism, and domestic demand would therefore exhibit a smaller 
contraction. In 2021, the Thai economy was projected to expand at 5.0 percent, higher than 
previously assessed. This was partly due to the lower base in 2020, and as government was 
expected to launch additional employment stimulus package and large -scale inve stment projects. 
However, economic activities in Thailand would remain substantially below its potential level.  
Additional assumptions underlying the economic projection included, first, there would be 
no severe second -wave of the COVID -19 outbreak in Tha iland. This would allow for the gradual 
re-opening of the country under the travel bubble scheme, which would be done through 
partnerships  between COVID -19-free countries, permitting travelling into targeted locations in 
each countries starting from the se cond half of 2020. Second, there would be a widespread 
availability of COVID -19 vaccines from the fourth quarter of 2021 onward.  
The value of Thai merchandise exports in 2020 would experience a sharper decline than 
previously assessed, due mainly to contr action in volume.  This was in line with the outlook 
of trading partner economies and global trade volume, as well as supply chain disruptions in some 
businesses. Meanwhile, prices of merchandise exports were projected to decline, mainly owing to 
prices of goods that were sensitive to movements in crude oil prices. Nevertheless, the gradual 
relaxation of containment measures in many countries would support the gradual recovery of 
merchandise exports from the third quarter of 2020 onward. In 2021, the value o f merchandise 
exports was expected to expand, both in terms of volume in response to the recovery of global 
economy and global trade, and in terms of price in line with the outlook of global crude oil prices. 
However, the value of merchandise exports would  be below the pre -pandemic level, as external 
demand had yet to fully recover. In addition, changing patterns of business operations worldwide 
under the new way of life in the post -COVID environment would limit the potential of certain 
industries to fully recover.  
The tourism sector was projected to recover more slowly than in the previous assessment,  
as the outbreak in other countries would be more prolonged and widespread than previously 
expected. The Thai government was expected to maintain its travel r estrictions on inbound foreign Monetary Policy Report  June 2020                                                                                                                        8 tourists for an extended period and would begin to gradually re -open the country for foreign tourists 
from certain countries under the travel bubble scheme in the second half of 2020.  
The current account balance was projected to register a surplus of 15.5 and 20.2 billion 
U.S. dollars in 2020 and 2021, respectively.  The current account balance in 2020 was revised 
down due to a larger deficit in the services balance, mainly as a result of a marked decline in 
tourism re ceipts. For 2021, the current account balance was projected to increase from the 
previous year, owing to gradual improvements in trade balance and tourism receipts.  
Public expenditure would play an important role in shoring up the economy in 2020 and 
supp orting the recovery in the period ahead.  The government was expected to accelerate 
disbursement of the fiscal year 2020 budget during the rest of the year, as well as reallocate the 
budget structure for a faster disbursement to remedy and restore the econo my thanks to the 
Budget Expenditure Transfer Bill , B.E. 2563 (A.D. 2020) and the revision of the fiscal year 2021 
budget structure. There would also be an additional liquidity support from the third phase of 
government relief measures to alleviate the impa ct of COVID -19. In addition, the government 
would introduce further measures to help those affected by the outbreak, which would partly help 
sustain business operations and employment. Nevertheless, investment spending by state -owned 
enterprises was projec ted to expand, which would be key mechanism to support the economy 
going forward.  
Private consumption was expected to contract in 2020 more than the previous assessment,  
particularly in the second quarter. This was due to the containment measures, as well  as a marked 
decline in non -farm income and weakening consumer confidence. However, the gradual 
relaxation of containment measures would lead to a gradual improvement in economic activities 
in the period ahead. Nevertheless, private consumption was expecte d to grow at a level below the 
pre-pandemic level throughout the forecast horizon. This was because households were expected 
to be cautious in spending given high uncertainties surrounding the COVID -19 situation going 
forward. Furthermore, households’ fina ncial positions would be more vulnerable given falling 
income and elevated debt levels.  
Private investment was expected to contract in 2020 more than the previous assessment.  
This was on account of contractions in both domestic and external demand, as wel l as high levels 
of excess production capacity, which caused most businesses to postpone their investment plans. 
However, the government’s infrastructure investment projects were underway, particularly the 
public -private partnership (PPP) projects both wit hin and outside the Eastern Economic Corridor 
(EEC). As for 2021, some investment projects would likely continue, particularly large -scale 
infrastructure investment and infrastructure investment to support the digital economy.  
Going forward, the Thai econo my would continue to face high uncertainties. Risks to  
the economic projection tilted downward and depended largely on the impact of COVID -19.  
The possibilities that the Thai economy would underperform the baseline projection 
would be due to the following factors.  First, the global economy could recover more slowly 
than expected or enter a severe recession, which would lead to a larger -than-expected impact 
on Thai merchandise exports. Second, default risks of businesses and households could 
increa se. Third, the recovery of the tourism sector could be slower than expected. Forth, 
Thailand could experience the second wave of the COVID -19 outbreak, triggering another 
round of lockdown measures. However, there were possibilities that the Thai economy Monetary Policy Report  June 2020                                                                                                                        9 would outperform the baseline projection due to (1) better -than-expected impacts of additional 
government’s stimulus measures to shore up domestic consumption  and investment, and 
measures to assist borrowers, (2) public infrastructure investment and PPP pro jects which 
could incentivize the private sector to invest more than expected, and (3) more relocations of 
production base to Thailand thanks to the success in containing the spread of the virus.  
Headline inflation in 2020 would be more negative than prev iously assessed,  mainly due to 
supply -side factors. This was particularly because of sharply declined energy prices in line with 
global crude oil prices, which was owing to decreasing demand following disruptions of global 
economic activities and high leve ls of excess production capacity. Moreover, a fall in headline 
inflation was partly due to government measures to reduce electrical and water bills. Meanwhile, 
core inflation would remain low  in line with muted demand -pull inflationary pressures. Looking 
ahead, headline inflation would gradually rise toward the target mainly in tandem with 
gradually rising crude oil prices. However, core inflation would remain subdued in line with Thailand’s 
gradual economic recovery outlook. The Committee thus projected he adline inflation to be 
negative at 1.7 percent in 2020 and turn positive at 0.9 percent in 2021. Core inflation was 
projected to be zero and 0.1 percent in 2020 and 2021, respectively. Going forward, the 
inflation outlook would remain highly uncertain, as the COVID -19 pandemic had altered global 
economic structure, which resulted in large excess capacity in several industries. In addition, trade 
protectionism and geopolitical risks could lead to deglobalization, which would eventually result in 
a significan t impact on global supply chains and prices of goods.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Monetary Policy Report  June 2020                                                                                                                        10 1. Global Economy  
Governments in many countries implemented containment measures to control the spread 
of COVID -19, causing disruptions to global economic activities. This severely affected 
economic prospects of Thailand's trading partner economies, particularly major advanced 
economies which were expected to enter a recession this year. Nevertheless, a series of 
financial and fiscal measures that had been implemented would help alle viate adverse 
impacts and support the economy in the period ahead . 
In the first quarter of 2020, major advanced economies contracted as a result of 
containment measures in the U.S., the euro area, and Japan.  Consequently, major advanced  
economies contracted from the previous quarter due to manufacturing, private consumption, 
and private investment, as well as merchandise exports, which contracted in line with global 
demand.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In 2020, major advanced economies were projected to con tinue to contract 
substantially and enter a recession. In particular, the economies would exhibit a 
sharper contraction in the second quarter of 2020 due to the severe outbreak situation, 
prompting governments to continue implementing containment measures to control 
the spread of the virus. However, the economies would gradually recover in the second 
half of 2020 following the gradual relaxation of containment measures.  Meanwhile, 
private consumption was expected to recover slowly as consumers became more c autious in 
their spending due to several factors. These included, first, weak labor markets (Chart 1.1), 
and, second, changes in spending behavior under the new normal, such as work from home, 
resulting in less commutes and away -from-home spending. Moreove r, tourism -related businesses  
would not recover fully in the initial phase, since tourism under the new normal following the 
relaxation of travel restrictions would take the form of a travel bubble, which would be done 
through partnerships between COVID -19-free countries, permitting t ravelling into targeted 
locations in each country. Third, weak consumer confidence due to an unfavorable income 
prospect and a protest in the U.S. that raised concerns over the second wave of the outbreak 
could delay the relaxation of containment measures.  Meanwhile, production was expected to 
increase slightly (Chart 1.2) after businesses were able to resume their operations. However, 
capacity utilization would remain lower than the pre -pandemic level, as global demand 
remained weak and the recovery of glo bal trade was still weighed down by the U.S. -China

Nevertheless, a series of financial and fiscal 
measures previously announced would help mitigate impacts on the economy and reduce risk 
of a severe contraction in the period ahead.  
The Chinese economy was projected to expand at a slower pace, while Asian economies 
would contract as the COVID -19 containment measures resulted in disruptions to 
economic activities across several sectors. However, a series of financi al and fiscal 
measures implemented would help alleviate the impacts and shore up the economy in the 
period ahead.  
In the first quarter of 2020, the Chinese and Asian economies (excluding Japan) 
contracted from the previous quarter , since the COVID -19 out break and the containment 
measures caused manufacturing, private consumption, private investment, and exports to 
contract. In 2020, the Chinese economy would exhibit a more modest growth than 
previously assessed  due to strict compliance to social distancin g measures, although 
businesses gradually resumed their operations after the Chinese authorities announced a 
relaxation of containment measures since the beginning of the second quarter (Chart 1.3). In 
addition, external demand contracted more than expecte d as a result of containment measures  in 
major trading partner countries, such as the U.S., the euro area and Japan. Going forward, 
falling employment and income would weigh on the recovery of the Chinese economy. 
However, a series of government measures t hat had been implemented would help mitigate 
the impact of the outbreak, preserve financial stability, as well as reduce risk of recession for 
the Chinese economy.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In 2020, Asian economies (excluding China and Japan) were projected to 
contract, de spite a relaxation of containment measures in some countries.  This was 
because many countries were still coping with a growing number of COVID -19 cases, while 
some countries faced the second wave of the outbreak after relaxing the containment 
measures, suc h as Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines, and South Korea. Moreover, strict 
social distancing measures in many countries continued to weigh on private consumption, 
services sector, and tourism. Meanwhile, the manufacturing and export sectors would recove r 
slowly, but signs of new orders for electronics products were observed partly due to temporary

Net capital outflows declined, with inflows resu ming in both equity and bond markets of 
emerging markets in some periods, as concerns among investors in the global financial 
markets subsided . 
In the second quarter of 2020, concerns among investors in the global financial 
markets subsided. This was refle cted in a continued decline in the VIX index1/ (Chart 1.5) since 
the end of March 2020. This was on account of accommodative monetary policies, particularly 
those implemented by advanced economies’ central banks, additional fiscal measures that 
had been in troduced in many countries to remedy and restore the economy, the relaxation of 
containment measures, as well as the progress on vaccines development. These factors 
helped restore investor confidence and led to a more gradual sell -off in both equities and 
bonds of emerging markets. At the beginning of June 2020, investors had resumed their 
investment in risky assets, particularly equity markets in emerging Asia, as reflected in rising 
MSCI EM index (Chart 1.6). However, investor confidence would likely rema in volatile due to 
development of the COVID -19 pandemic situation, as well as the economic data outturns in 
each period.  
Looking ahead, capital flows to emerging markets would continue to be highly volatile, 
due to the prolonged COVID -19 outbreak in many countries and risks of the second wave of 
the outbreak, re -intensifying trade tensions between the U.S. and China, geopolitical risks 
such as tensions between Mainland China and Hong Kong, as well as risk to global financial 
system stability owing to risin g solvency risks among corporates and households.

measures to alleviate the economic impact of the COVID -19. 
Governments in many countries worldwide implemented additional financial and 
fiscal measures to alleviate the economic impact of the COVID -19. Governments in 
major advanced and emerging market economies introduced a series of measures to 
shore up the economy , including relief measures aimed particularly at SMEs, households, 
and employment2/. However, governments in many major advanced economies started to face 
limitations in introducing additional measures due to lower fiscal policy space, as reflected in 
historically high public -debt-to-GDP ratios. Meanwhil e, central banks in major advanced 
economies implemented unconventional measures in addition to maintaining ultra -low 
policy interest rates.  The Federal Reserve (Fed) continued its quantitative easing (QE) 
measures, while the European Central Bank (ECB) co ntinued to inject liquidity in the financial 
system through longer -term refinancing operations (LTROs), and also undertook targeted 
longer -term refinancing operations (TLTROs) in order to support credit extension by financial 
institutions to the real econo my. At an unscheduled meeting in May 2020, the Bank of Japan 
(BOJ) launched a New Fund -Provisioning Measure to provide liquidity support for businesses, 
particularly SMEs. Meanwhile,  many regional central banks eased monetary policy further  by 
lowering their policy rates in order to mitigate the impact of the outbreak on the economy. 
These regional central banks included, for instance, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), 
Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM), and Bank of Korea (BOK). At the same tim e, some central 
banks extended the period of measures to alleviate financial burdens for borrowers, such as 
temporary debt holidays and soft loans offering low interest rates for financial institutions to 
encourage lending to the private sector.  
Moreover, a number of central banks introduced measures to safeguard stability 
in the financial markets to ensure sufficient liquidity in their respective markets. At the 
June -2020 meeting, the Fed stated that it would inject liquidity in the bond market through 
additional purchases of government bonds, agency mortgage -backed securities, as well as 
purchases of corporate bonds via exchange traded funds (ETFs) and direct purchases, to 
ensure the well -functioning of the financial markets and enhance the effectiveness o f monetary 
policy transmission. Meanwhile, the ECB announced additional purchases of government and 
corporate bonds through the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program (PEPP), with the 
increased total amount from 750 to 1,350 billion euros. Regional central ba nks also announced 
additional measures to ensure stability in the financial markets. These included, for instance, 
increased volume of government bond purchases, and injecting liquidity into the financial 
system via other instruments such as lowering reser ve requirement ratio (RRR).  
Thailand’s trading partner economies were projected to contract more severely in 2020 as 
a result of a -more -severe -than-expected impact of the COVID -19 containment measures, 
particularly in the second quarter of 2020. However, t he economies were expected to resume  
growth in 2021. Nonetheless, risks that trading partner economies would underperform 
the baseline projection increased mainly because the COVID -19 pandemic could become 
more severe and prolonged than expected.  
                                                             
2/ For more information, please see the link COVID -19 and Government Measures in Foreign Countries, May 2020 
(Available in Thai only).  Monetary Policy Report  June 2020                                                                                                                        14 Thailand ’s trading partner economies were projected to contract in 2020 more 
than previously assessed in the previous Monetary Policy Report , as the pandemic would 
be prolonged and weigh on economic activities more than expected. Moreover, containment 
measures in many countries severely affected consumption, investment, manufacturing, and 
exports. Moreover, the services sector was substantially affected and was expected to recover 
more slowly than the manufacturing sector. However, financial and fiscal measures tha t were 
already implemented and forthcoming would partly help prevent a severe economic contraction . 
In 2021, trading partner economies were expected to recover, as the COVID -19 outbreak 
would gradually subside, resulting in a gradual relaxation of containm ent measures. The 
Committee thus revised down economic growth projections for Thailand’s trading 
partners to a 4.6 percent contraction in 2020, followed by a 4.2 percent expansion in 
2021.  (Table 1.1).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Committee assessed that there remained risks that trading partner economies  
would underperform the baseline projection.  These risks included (1) a more severe and 
prolonged COVID -19 outbreak than previously assessed due to an emergence of the second 
wave of the outbreak, which could lead many c ountries to re -introduce the containment 
measures, (2) greater vulnerabilities in the global financial system owing to increased default 
risks among corporate and governments in some countries, or credit -rating downgrades,  
(3) re -intensifying trade tensio ns particularly between the U.S. and China, and (4) geopolitical 
risks such as tensions between Mainland China and Hong Kong. On the other hand, there 
were also possibilities that trading partners’ economic growth would outperform the 
baseline projection  owing to (1) a faster -than-expected ending of the outbreak due to 
effective healthcare measures in many countries and successful development of vaccines and 
medicines for the COVID -19, and (2) larger -than-expected effects of financial and fiscal 
measures in  many countries in stimulating the economy.

weakening global demand. However, crude oil prices rose slightly toward the end of the 
second quarter following an agreement on a crude oil production cut among major oil 
producers . 
Dubai crude oil prices in the second quarter of 2020 continued to decline from 
the previous quarter. During late March and May, crude oil prices dropped below 30 
U.S. dollars per barrel, du e to a sharp fall in global demand as a result of the COVID -19 
outbreak and a significant increase in crude oil production. This was because Saudi 
Arabia boosted its crude oil production after Russia refused to agree to the OPEC’s proposal 
at the meeting i n March, thereby triggering market concerns over global crude oil storage 
capacity. However, crude oil prices gradually increased toward the end of the second 
quarter, as OPEC and its allies such as Russia and the U.S. reached an agreement on 
a crude oil p roduction cut in April 2020.  Moreover, in June 2020, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and 
the United Arab Emirates pledged additional production cuts according to the agreement, 
while the U.S. reduced their production further due to breakeven cost considerations. As a 
result, global crude oil production fell more than expected. Going forward, however, crude oil 
prices would continue to be weighed down by negative factors, such as elevated crude oil 
inventory level and subdued global oil demand as a result of the COVID -19 pandemic, 
particularly for fuels used in transportation and travel.  
Despite supply -side factors causing  larger -than -expected  production  cuts, 
crude oil prices would continue to be weighed down by crude oil inventory level and global 
demand.  The Committee therefore maintained the projection  of Dubai crude oil prices in 
2020  at 35.1 U.S. dollars per barrel, close to the previous projection at 35.0 U.S. dollars per 
barrel. In 2021, Dubai crude oil 
prices were projected to increase 
from 34.0 to 37.0 U.S. dollars per 
barrel (Chart 1.7), where crude oil 
prices would gradually increase in 
line with gradual recovery of the 
global economy and a reduction  in 
crude oil supply from high -cost 
producers such as the U.S. Given 
high uncertainties surrounding  the 
current situation, risks to the 
projection of Dubai crude oil prices 
were expected to tilt downward , as 
the COVID -19 outbreak could affect 
the global economy more than 
expected. Moreover,  there were 
risks of re-intensifying trade tensions 
between  the U.S. and China, and the 
possibility that OPEC and related countries would fail to meet the production cut agreement. 
On the other hand, Dubai oil prices could be higher than the assessment as a result of more -
severe -than-expected geopolitical risks .

2.1 Recent Developments  
The COVID -19 outbreak became more severe and widespread, causing the Thai 
economy to contract in the first quarter of 2020 due to both external and domestic demand. 
The Thai economy was expected to contract substantially in the second quarter of 2020 
due to strict containment measures imposed in Thailand and abroad.  
 In the first quarter of 2020, the Thai economy contracted 1.8 percent from the 
same period last year due to external and domestic demand slowdow n in light of the 
COVID -19 outbreak that became more severe and widespread. Governments in many 
countries, including Thailand, thus implemented containment measures to control the 
spread of the virus, resulting in temporary disruptions of economic activiti es across 
several sectors.  Exports of services fell sharply due to international travel restrictions, which 
led tourism spending and foreign tourist figures across all nationalities to decline substantially. 
Merchandise exports expanded on account of gold exports. However, merchandise exports 
(excluding gold) continued to decline due to the following factors. First, the COVID -19 outbreak 
dampened demand from trading partners and global trade volume. Second, international 
travel restrictions resulted in disr uptions of supply chain and shipping routes. Third, the 
drought affected exports of agricultural products. Nonetheless, higher demand contributed to 
the export growth of certain products, such as food, medical products, and electronics, thanks 
to work -from-home measure and China’s production capacity that had yet to fully recover. 
Domestic demand declined as  household income and consumer confidence continued to 
weaken. Private consumption thus moderated despite growth in consumption of non -durable 
goods, es pecially necessities and electricity. Meanwhile, the delayed enactment of the Annual 
Budget Expenditure Act, B.E. 2563 (A.D. 2020) caused a continued contraction of public 
expenditure, both current and capital expenditures. However, investment of state -owned 
enterprises (SOEs) could still expand in line with investment in transportation and public 
utilities, while manufacturing and private investment declined on account of the contraction in 
economic activities.  
 In the second quarter of 2020, latest indica tors pointed to a severe economic 
contraction from the previous quarter due to strict containment measures imposed 
worldwide. However, a series of government relief measures for those affected by the 
outbreak and the gradual relaxation of containment measu res would shore up the 
economy in the period ahead. The more severe and global widespread COVID -19 outbreak 
led to temporary disruptions of economic activities in most trading partners. No foreign tourists 
were expected to visit Thailand at least until the  end of June due to restrictions on inbound 
foreign tourists to control the spread of the virus. Merchandise exports (excluding gold) and 
manufacturing in almost all industries would contract markedly on account of a sharp decline 
in economic activities an d global trade volume. Private consumption would contract in line with 
lower income of workers and concerns over the outbreak. Likewise, private investment would 
continue to fall due to considerably weaker demand and investor confidence, as well as high 
levels of excess production capacity. Nevertheless, public expenditure would increase on 
account of current expenditure due to disbursement for consumption of goods and services 
used in the public health response to prevent and control the outbreak. Public e xpenditure and Monetary Policy Report  June 2020                                                                                                                        17 the gradual relaxation of containment measures would thus shore up the economy in the 
period ahead.  
Overall household purchasing power significantly declined and became more vulnerable 
due to the COVID -19 outbreak and the drought.  
 The CO VID-19 outbreak and containment measures caused household purchasing 
power to further decline and become more vulnerable. Non-farm income  fell substantially as 
reflected in a marked decline in the number of insured workers in the social security system 
(Section 33 of the Social Security Act) across almost all sectors. This was accompanied by a 
significant increase in the number of workers w ho applied for unemployment benefits (Section 
38) mainly due to the termination of employment (Chart 2.1). The number of employees and 
firms affected by the temporary suspension of business (Section 75) also increased substantially  
(Chart 2.2). This sugges ted a more severe loss in income and working hours of those 
employed in both manufacturing and services sector, particularly in hotel, tourism and trade 
businesses.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Farm income  would fall on account of a significantly lower agricultural output, 
especially rice and sugarcane, mainly as a result of the drought. Agricultural prices would also 
fall, particularly prices of rubber due to weaker external demand. However, prices of whit e rice 
would increase due to lower output and higher external demand from the stocking up of food 
during the outbreak and the export quota imposed by major rice exporting countries. Nevertheless,  
there remained risk that warranted continued monitoring, inc luding weather conditions given 
low water levels in dams and possible delay in rainfall. However, rainfall was expected to 
increase somewhat during the beginning of the rainy season.  
Headline inflation in April -May 2020 turned negative mainly due to energy  prices, but  was 
projected to be less negative in June due to gradually rising energy and fresh food prices.  
 Headline inflation in the first two months of the second quarter of 2020 averaged at  
-3.22 percent, down from 0.42 percent in the previous quarte r (Chart 2.3). The fall in headline 
inflation was mainly in tandem with a larger decline in energy prices from the same period last year.

in a significant increase in the number of workers who 
applied for unemployment benefits

In particular, prices of vegetables and fruits 
fell significantly in line with domestic and 
external demand, as well as due to the higher 
base of  vegetable prices in the previous year.

percent, down from 0.53 percent in the previous quarter, mainly because of the fall in housing 
prices (Chart 2.4) in line with government relief measures to cut water bills. In addition , public 
transport prices grew at a lower rate due to the high base effect from last year’s public 
transportation fare  increase . Meanwhile, core inflation in the food category increased slightly 
owing to higher prices of seasoning and condiments (Chart 2.5 ). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Short -term (one -year ahead) inflation expectations  edged up due to the very low 
base effect in the second quarter of 2020. According to the survey of professional forecasters 
in June 2020, inflation expectations recorded 1.3 percent, an in crease from 1.1 percent in the

Inflation expectations based on the survey of businesses in May 2020 
remained stable at 1.5 percent. Long -term (five -year ahead) inflation expectations  according  
to the survey of professional forecasters in April 2020 declined from 2.0 percent in October 
2019 to 1.8 percent. In addition, long -term inflation expectations based on a macro -finance 
term structure model with bond yields and macroeconomic data stabilized at 1.9 percent in 
the first quarter of 2020.  
Short -term money market rates, lending rates, and deposit rates continued to fall in line with 
the policy rate, as well as the reduction in Financial Institutions Development Fund (FIDF) 
contribution.  
 During the second quarter of 2020, 
financial markets became more stable 
following a series of measures to stabilize 
financial markets introduced by the Bank of 
Thailand (BOT). These measures included 
the Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (MFLF) 
and the establishment of Corporate Bond 
Stabilization Fund (BSF).3/ At the same 
time, the Committee continued to cut the 
policy rate to the historically lowest level of 
0.50 percent, which helped ease financial 
conditions further. The real policy rate fell 
from the previous quarter and remained 
low relative to tho se of other emerging 
market economies (Chart 2.6).  
 Short -term money market rates continued to decline in tandem with the policy rate cuts. 
Short -term government bond yields gradually fell since the beginning of the second quarter, 
primarily due to the pol icy rate cuts and increased demand for government bonds from mutual 
funds and contractual saving institutions (Chart 2.7). Long -term government bond yields 
declined by a lesser degree than short -term government bond yields, resulting in a steeper 
governmen t bond yield curve. Long -term government bond yields moved in tandem with the 
U.S. treasury and regional bond yields, which were sensitive to economic figures and the 
COVID -19 outbreak situation at a given time.  
 In the first week of the second quarter, go vernment bond yields increased rapidly from 
the previous quarter as concerns over the COVID -19 outbreak prompted domestic mutual 
funds and foreign investors to sell off a considerable number of government bonds. However, 
government bond yields subsequently  declined owing to concerns over the outlook of both 
Thai and foreign economies, before increasing again in late May following the relaxation of 
containment measures in many countries. Nonetheless, government bond yields became 
volatile toward the end of t he quarter due to several factors, such as (1) investor confidence 
over the spread of COVID -19 and containment measures imposed in many countries, as well

Source: Bank of Thailand (data as of June 23, 2020)Monetary Policy Report  June 2020                                                                                                                        21  The cost of financing through financial institutions fell in line with the policy rate 
and the reduction in the FIDF contribution from 0.46 to 0.23 percent of the deposit base for 
two years. The five largest commercial banks reduced lending rates quite significantly  in this 
quarter. The average minimum loan rates (MLR) decreased to 5.36 percent, the average 
minimum retail rates (MRR) declined to 6.00 percent, and the average minimum overdraft 
rates (MOR) fell to 5.87 per cent (Chart 2.9). Meanwhile, the new loan rates (NLR)4/ in April 
2020 remained low at 3.6 percent (Chart 2.10). Similarly,  deposit rates  gradually declined in 
tandem with reference loan rates (Chart 2.11). In particular, 3 -month, 6 -month and  
12-month fixe d deposits rates fell to 0.37, 0.49 and 0.49 percent respectively. Meanwhile, 
commercial banks reduced savings rate to 0.25 percent from 0.46 percent, level of which had 
been maintained since late 2015.  
 Despite the overall decline in government bond yiel ds and commercial banks’ rates, 
corporate credit spread remained stable at high levels following the increase in the beginning 
of the second quarter of 2020 (Chart 2.12). This was because large investors rapidly 
redeemed their investment units in mutual fu nds, especially those with majority of investment 
in foreign debt instruments, amidst excessively 
volatile foreign asset prices caused by the 
COVID -19 pandemic. Although the redemption  
slowed down following the BOT’s introduction 
of the MFLF and volatility  in the corporate bond 
market decreased following the establishment 
of the BSF, corporate bond  yields remained 
high. This was because investors were still 
concerned over economic conditions as 
containment measures and sharply declined 
oil prices could weig h on the profitability of 
some businesses.  
Private sector financing accelerated on account of the need for liquidity buffer among 
businesses affected by the COVID -   outbreak, and as a result of the government’s soft 
loan programs for SMEs. Meanwhile, hou sehold credit growth continued to soften.  
 Since the first quarter of 2020, the BOT, related agencies, and financial institutions, 
had been introducing a series of measures to enhance liquidity and support the stability and 
well-functioning of financial m arkets. These measures helped ensure the distribution of 
liquidity in the financial system, which was ample at the macro level, to  businesses and 
households affected by the pandemic, as well as relieve debt servicing burden in time of crisis. 
Thanks to these measures, the private sector financing could continue with details as follows.

to accelerate  by 4.6 percent in April 
2020 from to the end of the first quarter of 
2019 (Chart 2.13). Business credits  
expanded 5.8 percent  in April 2020 (Chart 
2.14) on the back of a strong expansion in 
business loans. However, cor porate bond 
issuances moderated, partly as investors 
became more cautious in investing in the 
corporate bond market after the period of 
liquidity strain at the end of March 2020. 
Thus, corporate financing through bond 
issuance was limited, especially those  
rated below BBB. In contrast, business 
loans accelerated in almost all sectors 
owing to (1) the need for extra liquidity to 
withstand the impact of the outbreak, as 
reflected in the surge in commercial credits 
especially for working capital (Chart 2.15), (2) the government’s soft loan programs for SMEs, 
and (3) higher demand for loans to compensate for limited funding through bond issuances of 
some corporates.  Meanwhile, household credit growth  slowed down further  to 3.6 percent, 
particularly credit card l oans which softened on the back of a sharp fall in spending related to  
tourism, restaurants,  and department stores .

rising as more liquidity would be needed to  cushion against the economic impact of the 
COVID -19 pandemic, as well as to alter business models in the period ahead in response to 
people’s new way of life. On the other hand, demand for household credits was expected to 
moderate since household income was affected by both the COVID -19 pandemic and the 
drought. Based on the survey in April 2020, financial institutions were expected to maintain 
tight credit underwriting standards in the second quarter of 20206/, given deteriorating loan 
qualities of busin ess loans (both loans extended to large businesses and SMEs), credit card 
loans, and auto leasing. However, the government’s soft loan programs would help expand 
accessibility to credits for the private sector and somewhat facilitate more loan extensions b y 
financial institutions . 
The baht against the U.S. dollar and the nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) 
appreciated throughout the second quarter due to the relaxation of containment measures 
in the region and sales of U.S. dollars by domestic players.  
 In the second quarter of 2020, 
the baht against the U.S. dollar  
appreciated relative to the end of the 
previous quarter (Chart 2.16). At the 
beginning of the quarter, the baht 
weakened in light of high uncertainties 
surrounding the global spread of the 
COVID -19 in the previous quarter, as 
well as U.S. dollar strength during the 
period of dollar liquidity strain. However, 
the baht subsequently strengthen in line 
with other regional currencies. This was 
because many countries, especially 
Asian countries inc luding Thailand, were 
successful in containing the spread of 
the virus, allowing governments to 
gradually relax containment measures and economic activities to slowly pick up. At the same 
time, accommodative monetary and fiscal policies implemented by majo r advanced 
economies helped boost investor confidence, causing capital outflows by non -residents to 
slow and inducing the return of capital into regional markets in June, especially into the bond 
markets. Nevertheless, the strength of the baht was also sup ported by domestic factors 
including sales of U.S. dollars associated with the sales of gold when pandemic uncertainties 
drove up the gold price, as well as sales of U.S. dollar forward contracts by institutional 
investors that invested abroad in order to hedge against foreign exchange risk. Thus, the baht 
averaged at 31.22 baht to U.S. dollar in June 2020, a 2.8 percent appreciation from an average 
of March 2020.

Rate (NEER) index  averaged at 123.88 in 
June 2020 (as of Ju ne 23, 2020), 1.8 percent  
higher than the average of March 2020. This 
was attributable to the baht appreciation 
against most trading partner currencies 
(Chart 2.17). Meanwhile, the preliminary 
Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER)  in 
May 2020 weakened 1.2 pe rcent from an 
average of March 2020, mainly due to a 
larger fall in Thailand’s consumer price index 
relative to those of trading partner countries.  
 Going forward, exchange rates would likely remain volatile pertaining to risk of the 
second wave of the ou tbreak, monetary and fiscal policies in major advanced and regional 
economies that would remain accommodative, and high uncertainties surrounding the 
recovery of trading partner economies. In addition, global financial stability risk from corporate 
debt de faults in many countries, including Thailand, could result in sharp and sudden 
corrections in global asset prices. Against such backdrop, the Committee expressed concerns 
over the baht appreciation which could affect the economic recovery. Therefore, the 
Committee deemed it necessary to closely monitor developments in the foreign exchange 
markets in order to assess the necessity of implementing additional appropriate measures.  
The Thai financial system became more vulnerable due to this year’s contraction o f the 
economic outlook in light of the COVID -19 situation. Vulnerabilities increased across 
multiple fronts, especially the deterioration in debt servicing ability of businesses and 
households.  
 The Thai financial system became more vulnerable due to this  year’s contraction of 
the economic outlook in light of the COVID -19 pandemic and the impact of the containment 
measures on household and business income. Nevertheless, fiscal sector stability remained 
sound, providing fiscal policy space to support the ec onomic restoration and restructuring in 
the coming periods. Nevertheless, debt -to-GDP ratio would likely increase, but would remain 
at a manageable level. Amid high uncertainties surrounding the COVID -19 situation and risk 
of a larger -than-expected contrac tion in the global economy, risks to financial stability that 
warranted monitoring could be summarized as follows.  
1. Although volatilities in the Thai financial markets subsided after the introduction  
of measures to stabilize financial markets, there rem ained a need to closely monitor 
risks in the financial markets going forward.  The BOT, in collaboration with relevant 
agencies, implemented a series of measures to stabilize financial markets as preventive 
measures against systemic risks. These measures ra nged from outright purchases of 
government bonds to enhance liquidity in the bond market, the establishment of the MFLF and 
the BSF, as well as the policy rate cuts. These measures helped boost confidence of investors, 
resulting a slower redemption of thei r investment in the bond market. Financial market 
volatilities thus declined and effective market functioning was restored. Furthermore, risk of 
the U.S. dollar liquidity squeeze in the Thai financial markets remained low, thanks to the high

Also, external debt to GDP was low and the current account 
remained in surplus, suggesting a modest demand for U.S. dollar in the short term.  
 Nevertheless, there remained a need to closely monitor risks in the financial markets, 
given high uncertainties pertaining to the global and Thai economic recovery, as well as 
financial market developments. Should investors turned more pessimistic about the severity 
of the global economic contraction, this could trigger sharp corrections in global  asset prices 
or corporate debt defaults in many countries, which could in turn affect the Thai financial markets .   
2. Liquidity and debt servicing ability of households and businesses deteriorated  
in light of worsening economic conditions . Household financial positions became more 
fragile with rising risk of defaults.  This was reflected in the household debt to GDP ratio, 
which remained elevated at 80.1 percent in the first quarter of 2020. Also, the NPL ratio of 
consumer loans rose from 2.9 percent i n the previous quarter to 3.2 percent in the first quarter 
of 20207/, in line with deteriorating quality of consumer loans across all loan categories, 
especially credit card and personal loans. Nonetheless, households with monthly income of 
less than 15,00 0 baht had risk of liquidity shortages and low buffer against income shocks 
arising from the COVID -19 pandemic. Since nearly all of their income had to be spent on 
consumption expenses, their savings would be insufficient to provide cushion against severe 
income shocks. If these households were to lose their income, their savings would only cover 
their expenses for no more than 3 months8/.  
 Similarly, financial positions of 
businesses became more  vulnerable 
with higher risk of default s. This was due 
to ma ny factors. First, the outlook of 
corporate income worsened in light of the 
COVID -19 pandemic, as indicated by the 
operating profit margin (OPM) and interest 
coverage ratio (ICR) which remained 
persistently in the negative territory9/. In 
particularly, bus inesses that warranted close 
monitoring included those experiencing 
severe impacts and unable to recover 
quickly, such as hotels and restaurants. In 
addition, some businesses were already 
financially fragile prior to the pandemic due 
to elevated debt level s, such as businesses 
in real estate and construction, or due to weak profitability, such as SMEs in textile and trading 
sectors. Second, investors in the corporate bond markets had lower risk tolerance, leading to 
rollover risks among issuing companies. F urthermore, some businesses that suffered impacts 
from the COVID -19 could face risk of credit -rating downgrades to non -investment grade, 
                                                             
7/  Deteriorating quality of consumer loans in the first quarter of 2020 was partly a result of adjustments regarding 
classification of financial instrument s under the Thai Financial Reporting Standards 9 (TFRS 9), which was 
adopted for the first time in this quarter.

Moreover, corporate bond default risk s could trigger knock -on effects to other related parties 
in the financial system. These included, for example, cross -default, especially in the case that 
creditors were commercial banks, and savings cooperatives with significant holdings of 
corporate bond s, as well as mutual fund unit holders.  
 In recent periods, the government and the BOT had implemented a series of fiscal, 
financial, and credit measures to alleviate the impact of the COVID -19 on businesses and 
households (BOX : Recent progress on the Bank  of Thailand’s financial and credit relief 
measures to address the impact of COVID -19).  
3. Although stability of financial institutions remained robust, it warranted close 
monitoring given deteriorating debt servicing ability of businesses and households 
amid high uncertainties surrounding the spread of COVID -19. Stability of financial 
institutions remained sound, as reflected by adequately high levels of commercial banks’ 
capital buffers and reserves, providing cushion against risks of deteriorating credi t quality. At 
the end of the first quarter, capital buffers in the commercial banks’ system totaled 2, 3  billion 
baht, constituting a BIS ratio of 18.7 percent. Reserves stood at 719.2 billion baht, leading to 
a reserves -to-NPL ratio of 143.3 percent.  
 Maintaining a high level of capital was considered an important measure to 
ensure commercial banks’ ability to withstand future uncertainties and preserve the 
lending capacity needed to support the economic recovery after the COVID -19 pandemic 
subsided. As a result, on June 18, 2020, the BOT issued a circular asking commercial banks 
to suspend interim dividend payments for the year 2020, and share buybacks, early 
redemptions or purchases of tier -1 or tier -2 capital securities10/. This would help maintain 
strong capital positions of commercial banks in the coming periods.  
4. The real estate market still faced high risk from falling demand for residences 
from domestic and foreign buyers, especially during the first half of 2020 due to the 
COVID -19 pandemic. The oversupply was thus expected to rise.  In light of the situation, 
some developers began to make some adjustments regarding their supplies in the first quarter 
of 2020, as reflected in the 67 percent reduction in new condominium launches compared to 
the same period last year (Chart 2.19). However, there remained certain be haviors that 
warranted monitoring as they could lead to the build -up of vulnerabilities. In particular, some 
developers engaged in competition to reduce excess supplies, such as agreeing to cover 
mortgage installments for their buyers for the period of 1 -5 years. These mortgages would be 
at risk of becoming NPL in the future, if buyers could not afford the installments once supports 
from developers ended. In addition, financial positions of some developers that relied on 
funding through the corporate bond m arket should also be monitored given risks from higher 
funding costs and credit -rating downgrades.

2.2 Outlook for the Thai Economy  
The Thai economy would contract in 2020 more than previously assessed in the previous 
Monetary Policy Report . Largest contraction was expected in the second quarter due to  
a-more -severe -than-expected COVID -19 pandemic and the economy would gradually recover 
from the third quarter onward. Meanwhile, headline inflation would be more negative, mainly 
on account of  energy prices.  
 The Committee assessed that the Thai economy would contract 8.1 percent in 
2020, more than previously assessed in the previous Monetary Policy Report . Such 
severe contraction would be observed across almost all economic growth components,  
except public expenditure. This was due to a more -severe -than-expected COVID -19 
pandemic and the containment measures implemented by governments in many countries 
including Thailand. This led to temporary disruptions of global economic activities especial ly 
in the second quarter of 2020. Thailand’s tourism and merchandise exports were thus 
projected to markedly contract, which would weigh on private consumption as a result of 
weakening income and employment. In addition, economic activities would recover s lower 
than expected, as people were still concerned over the outbreak despite the government’s 
success in containing the spread of the virus in the second quarter of 2020. Furthermore, 
weaker domestic and external demand would result in a sharp decline of private investment. 
However, public expenditure, together with transfers, tax, and other financial measures, would 
play an important role in shoring up the economy in the period ahead. Nevertheless, the Thai 
economy was projected to bottom out in the secon d quarter of this year and would 
gradually recover from the third quarter onward,  (Chart 2.20) following the relaxation of 
containment measures in many countries, including Thailand, and the re -opening of the 
country for inbound foreign tourists under the travel bubble scheme. Merchandise exports, 
tourism, and domestic demand would therefore begin to improve. In 2021, the Thai economy

 was projected to expand at 5.0 percent, 
higher than previously assessed in the 
previous Monetary Policy Report . This 
was pa rtly due to the lower base of 
tourism and merchandise exports in 2020, 
and as government was exp  ected to 
launch additional employment stimulus 
packages and large -scale investment 
projects. However, the Thai economy 
would still remain substantially below i ts 
potential level given changing patterns of 
business operations, way of life, and 
employment patterns in the post -COVID 
environment. This could cause some 
businesses to not fully recover.     
Additional assumptions underlying the economic projection in t his Report 
included, first, there would be no severe second -wave of the COVID -19 outbreak in Thailand. 
This would allow for the gradual re -opening of the country under the travel bubble scheme, 
which would be done through partnerships between COVID -19-free countries, permitting 
travelling into targeted locations in each countries starting from the second half of 2 0 20 . 
Second, there would be a widespread availability of COVID -19 vaccines from the fourth 
quarter of 2021 onward, despite delaying from previ ously anticipated from mid -2021.     
Headline inflation in 2020 would be more negative than previously assessed, 
mainly due to supply -side factors, where it was projected to be negative at 1.7 percent, 
before gradually rising to 0.9 percent in 2021. Headl ine inflation would return to the 
target in 2021 in line with gradually increasing crude oil prices and the economic recovery .  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Summary of the key forecast assumptions  
 Trading partner economies were projected to markedly contract in 2020 due to the COVID -19 
outbreak that became more severe, widespread, and prolonged than expected. This led 
to larger -than-expected disruptions to global economic activities in the second quarter. 
However, trading partner economies were expected to recover slowly from the third 
quarter of 2020 onward following the relaxation of lockdown measures and a series of 
additional stimulus packages implemented by governments in many countries, including

 both financial and fiscal measures. Trading partner economies wou ld thus grow at a high 
rate in 2021, mainly due to the low base effect, but overall economic activities would 
remain below the pre -pandemic level.  
 The Federal funds rate  was projected to be maintained at a range of 0.00 - 0.25 percent 
throughout the forecast horizon.  
 Regional currencies (excluding the Chinese yuan ) depreciated slightly more than previously 
projected throughout the forecast horizon due to a larger -than-expected impact of COVID -19 
pandemic on Asian economies. This was reflected in a weaker -than-assessed regional 
currencies index. However, regional curr encies would gradually strengthen in the period ahead 
in line with a better recovery of Asian economies over major advanced economies after the 
pandemic subsided. In addition, the U.S. dollar was expected to weaken amid concerns over 
the political protest situation and prolonged outbreak in the U.S., as well as the outlook of trade 
tensions between the U.S. and China which could intensify prior to the U.S. presidential election 
in November.  
 Dubai crude oil prices  would remain largely unchanged in 2020 and would gradually rise in the 
following year in line with gradually recovering global economy and a larger -than-expected 
production cut, following an agreement to cut crude oil production of major oil producers 
and crude oil production cut by the U.S. as the  revenue was not sufficient to compensate 
the costs. However, crude oil prices would remain at low levels throughout the forecast horizon.   
 Farm income (excluding government support measure s) was expected to contract by a larger 
extent in 2020 due to both output and prices. Agricultural output would decline more than 
previously assessed in line with lower volume of rice and sugarcane due to a larger -than-
expected impact of the drought. Meanwhile, agricultural prices were expected to fall mainly 
in line with  prices of rubber as a result of a large drop in external demand, although prices 
of white rice rose from the stocking -up of food during the outbreak. In addition, farm income 
in 2021 would largely expand due to the low base effect, as well as better assum ptions on 
the weather and dam water levels toward the end of the rainy season in 2020.  
 The Emergency Decree Authorizing the Ministry of Finance to Raise Loans to Solve Problems,  
to Remedy and Restore the Economy and Society as Affected by the Coronavirus Disease 
Pandemic in 2019 (B.E. 2563) totaling 1 trillion baht and the reallocation of the budget 
structure for a faster disbursement to remedy and restore the economy thanks to the Budget 
Expenditure Transfer Bill B.E. 2563 (A.D. 2020) and the revision of the fiscal year 2021

The value of Thai merchandise exports in 2020  would experience a sharper decline 
than previously assessed, due mainly to the contraction in volume. This was in line with the 
outlook of trading partner economies and global trade volume that sharply contracted, as well as 
supply chain disruptions in so me businesses. Export indicators suggested that Thai exports would 
continue to markedly contract in the second quarter. Nevertheless, the gradual relaxation of 
containment measures in many countries would support merchandise exports to improve in line 
with economic activities. Meanwhile, prices of merchandise exports were projected to decline, 
mainly owing to prices of goods that were sensitive to movements of crude oil prices. In 2021 , the 
value of merchandise exports was expected to expand,  both in terms of volume in response 
to the recovery of global economy and global trade, and in terms of price in line with the outlook 
of global crude oil prices. However, the value of merchandise exports would be substantially below 
the pre -pandemic level, as changing patterns of business operations under the new way of life in 
the post -COVID environment would limit the potential of certain industries to fully recover. The 
Committee therefore assessed the value of merchandise exports  to sharply contract by 
10.3 percent in 2020 before expanding at 4.5 percent in 2021.    
Exports of services were expected to contract more severely in line with the number of 
foreign tourists.   
The tourism sector was projected to recover more slowly than the previous 
assessment, (Chart 2.21) although the government was successful in containing the spread 
of the virus within the second quarter of 2020 as previously assessed. However, the outbreak 
in other countries would be more prolonged and widespread than previously expected. Th e 
Thai government was thus expected to maintain its travel restrictions on inbound foreign 
tourists for an extended period and would begin to gradually re -open the country for foreign 
tourists under the travel bubble scheme in the second half of 2020. The foreign tourist 
figures were therefore projected to be 8.0 and 16.2 million persons in 2020 and 2021, 
respectively, lower than previously assessed in the previous Monetary Policy Report.

billion U.S. dollars in 2020 and 2021, respectively.  The current account balance in 2020 
was revised down from the previous assessment due to a larger deficit in the services balance, 
mainly as a result of a marked decline in touris m receipts. Meanwhile, trade balance was 
expected to record a slightly lower surplus, although the value of merchandise exports largely 
declined. This was as the value of imports also experienced a sharp reduction in response to 
lower demand for imports of  both raw materials and intermediate goods for export -related 
manufacturing and domestic sales. In 2021, the current account balance was projected to 
increase from the previous year, owing to gradual improvements in trade balance and tourism 
receipts.  
Public expenditure would be key economic growth driver and would exhibit a higher -than-
expected growth than previously assessed.  
Public expenditure would play an important role in shoring up the economy in 
2020 and supporting the economic recovery in the comin g periods. The government was 
expected to accelerate disbursement of the fiscal year 2020 budget during the rest of the year, 
as well as reallocate the budget structure for a faster and continuous disbursement to remedy 
and restore the economy thanks to th e Budget Expenditure Transfer Act, B.E. 2563 (A.D. 
2020) and the revision of the fiscal year 2021 budget structure. There would also be an 
additional liquidity support from the Emergency Decree Authorizing the Ministry of Finance to 
Raise Loans to Solve Pr oblems, to Remedy and Restore the Economy totaling 1 trillion baht, 
which was part of the third phase of government relief measures to alleviate the impact of 
COVID -19. The liquidity support included (1) spending on public health, (2) transfers to remedy 
those affected by the outbreak under projects, such as “You will never be left behind” project 
and project to remedy farmers and vulnerable groups, and (3) spending to restore the 
economy and society in the coming periods. In addition, the government would introduce 
further measures to help those affected by the outbreak, including credit measures through 
specialized financial institutions (SFIs) and tax measures. This would partly help sustain 
business operations and employment. Nevertheless, investment spe nding by state -owned 
enterprises was projected to expand, despite slowing down somewhat from the previous 
assessment due to adjustment in investment plan in response to the COVID -19 situation.  
Private consumption would contract more than previously assessed, but started to show signs 
of a gradual improvement in the period ahead .  
 Private consumption would contract in 2020 more than previously assessed, 
especially in the second quarter where severe contraction would be observed due to the impact 
of containment measures, as well as weakening non -farm income and consumer confidence. 
However, domestic outbreak situation that began to be contained would allow the government 
to gradually relax containment measures and facilitate a gradual pick -up of econo mic activities 
in the period ahead. Nevertheless, a series of government measures aimed at supporting those 
affected by the outbreak and boosting domestic tourism in the second half of this year would 
help boost non -farm income and private consumption to s ome extent. Meanwhile, farm income 
was expected to gradually recover as the drought situation improved. Nevertheless, private 
consumption would be below the pre -pandemic level throughout the forecast horizon, as 
households would be more cautious in their s pending in the period ahead amid heightening Monetary Policy Report  June 2020                                                                                                                        32 uncertainties on the COVID -   situation. Moreover, households’ financial positions became 
more fragile given declining income and elevated debt levels.  
Private investment was expected to contract in the short ru n in line with lower domestic 
and external demand  
Private investment was expected to contract in 2020 more than the previous assessment.  
This was on account of the contraction in both domestic and external demand, as well as high 
levels of excess productio n capacity, which caused many businesses to alter patterns of 
business operations. Coupled with the uncertain COVID -19 situation, most businesses thus 
postponed investment plans. However, government’s infrastructure investment projects were 
underway, parti cularly the public -private partnership (PPP) projects both within and outside 
the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC). As for 2021, some investment projects would likely 
continue , particularly large -scale infrastructure investment and infrastructure investment  to 
support the digital economy, including accelerated investment in the 5G network following the 
successful auction in the first quarter of 2020. In addition, the COVID -19 pandemic resulted in 
higher demand from households and businesses for technology pr oducts. Furthermore, 
merchandise exports and tourism would gradually recover which would partly support the 
expansion of private investment.  
Projection of headline inflation would be more negative in the short term due to supply -
side factors  
Projection o f headline inflation in 2020 would be negative at 1.7 percent, lower 
than previously assessed in the previous Monetary Policy Report , mainly owing to 
supply -side factors. This was particularly because of sharply declined energy prices in line 
with global c rude oil prices, which was owing to decreasing demand following disruptions of 
global economic activities and high levels of excess production capacity. Moreover, a fall in 
headline inflation was partly due to government measures to reduce electrical and w ater bills. 
Meanwhile, core inflation would remain low in line with muted demand -pull inflationary 
pressures. As for 2021, headline inflation was expected to gradually rise to 0.9 percent 
and return to the target mainly in tandem with gradually rising crud e oil prices. Core inflation 
was projected to be zero and 0.1 percent in 2020 and 2021, respectively,  in response to 
gradual economic recovery outlook.   
Economic and inflation projections were subject to greater downside risks and were highly 
uncertain  
The Committee assessed that the Thai economy in the period ahead would be 
highly uncertain, subject to downside risk, and mainly depended on the COVID -19 
impact. This was reflected in a wider fan chart that tilted toward the downside. (Chart 
2.22) The poss ibilities that the Thai economy would underperform the baseline 
projection would be due to the following factors. First, the global economy could recover 
more slowly than expected or enter a severe recession on account of several factors including 
an emerg ence of the second wave of the outbreak in many countries, which would lead to 
larger -than-expected impact on Thai merchandise exports. Second, default risks of 
businesses and households could increase. Third, the recovery of the tourism sector could be 
slower than expected including a slower -than-expected process of the travel bubble scheme. 
Forth, Thailand could experience the second wave of the COVID -19 outbreak, triggering Monetary Policy Report  June 2020                                                                                                                        33 another round of lockdown measures. However, there were possibilities that the Th ai 
economy would outperform the baseline projection due to  (1) better -than-expected 
impacts of additional government’s stimulus measures to shore up domestic consumption and 
investment, and measures to assist borrowers, (2) public infrastructure investment  and PPP 
projects which could incentivize the private sector to invest more than expected, and (3) more 
relocations of production base to Thailand thanks to Thailand’s success in containing the 
spread of the virus. Meanwhile,  there remained downside risks to headline and core 
inflation projections  (Chart 2.23 and 2.24) in line with risks to crude oil prices and the 
economic growth projection.

 Assessing risk of deflation in Thailand  
The severe COVID -19 pandemic during the first half of 2020 prompted governments 
in many countries, including Thailand, to implement containment measures, which led to 
unprecedented disruptions of global economic activities. Moreover,  the changing global and 
Thai economic  environment  substantially affected Thailand’s inflation in the recent periods, 
and partly  explained  the negative inflation  which averaged at -1.04 percent during the first five 
months of 2020. Inflation has remained in the negative territory since March and re ached the 
lowest level in a decade at –3.44 percent in May. This led to the question of whether 
Thailand  would experience deflation. The Committee  thus saw the need to develop a better 
understanding  among the public regarding the definition, the causes, an d impacts  of deflation, 
as well as to assess whether Thailand is currently experiencing deflation.   
Definition, Causes, and Impacts of Deflation   
Inflation is narrowly defined as a situation when overall price levels of goods 
and services experience  a pers istent contraction . For this narrow definition, however, the 
assessment criteria  adopted by each international organization varies. For instance, the 
ECB11/ set the criteria  at three consecutive months of negative inflation, while the IMF12/ used 
the criteri a of 3 - 6 consecutive months.  Deflation could arise as a result of supply -side 
factors , when price levels of goods and services fell as a result of lower costs of production 
thanks to higher labor productivity,  better production technology, or cheaper raw  materials. 
Lower prices  as a result of  these supply -side factors  help stimulate consumer demand  and 
will, in turn, benefit the overall economy.  On the other hand,  deflation  could  be caused by 
demand -side factors , whereby prices of goods and services fall as a result of subdued 
demand. This typically occurs during a prolonged economic recession where consumers lack 
purchasing power, or expect prices to fall further in the future and therefore postpone their 
spending. Producers then need to cut prices in ord er to stimulate sales, as well as reduce both 
production and investment. This consequently affects employment and labor income, which 
will further depress the economy and drive  down  prices, resulting in a deflationary spiral.   
However, the assessment of de flation according to the narrow definition above only 
takes into account the period of time that overall prices of goods and services experience a 
contraction. An appropriate assessment of deflation should instead follow a broader 
definition which takes in to consideration the causes and impacts of deflation in a 
comprehensive manner.  Deflation, in its broad definition, occurs when prices of goods and 
services experience a persistent contraction that  are broad -based across  most categories, 
and the central ba nk is unable to anchor  inflation expectations of the public, which mostly 
occurs when demand and employment  face a prolonged contraction. According to this broad 
definition, countries that used to experience deflation include the U.S., many countries in th e 
euro area. Deflation was also observed in Japan  during the 1930s, and  from the end of 
1990s  until the beginning of 2000s.

 Current risk of deflation in Thailand  
Negative headline inflation that occurred in Thailand for three consecutive 
months since March 2020  was not a sign of deflation, as the situation did not meet all 
four criteria according to a broad definition of deflation. (Chart 1) Details are as follows.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Criteria 1: a persistent contraction in the prices of goods and services   
Persistent negative headline inflation in Thailand during the first half of 2020 was  mainly   
a result of supply -side factors. These included, in particular, a sharp fall in energy prices. This 
was as domestic retail oil prices  fell in line with global crude oil prices and the government 
measures to reduce electricity charges to alleviate  the impact of  the COVID -19 outbreak. 
However, considering the underlying inflatio n which is used to assess future’s inflation 
suggested that  headline inflation  would rise in the period ahead, in line with the BOT’s 
latest projection which  expected headline inflation to turn positive in 2021 .  
Criteria 2: a broad -based contraction in th e prices of goods and services in the inflation basket   
The prices of goods and services in Thailand’s inflation basket contracted  only 
in some categories . Prices of around 70 percent of goods and services in the inflation basket 
increased or remained stab le. Meanwhile, the number of goods which experienced falling  prices 
increased somewhat in recent periods. However,  this was, in part,  the result of government

 me asu res to alleviate  the impact of the COVID -19 (Chart 2), such as reducing electricity and 
water bills for three months.  In addition, the government has also requested cooperation from 
businesses to reduce costs of living for households,  thereby  leading  businesses  to launch  more 
promotions.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Criteria 3:  the central bank is unable to anchor inflation expectations   
Long -term headline inflation expectations remained within the monetary policy target. 
According to the most recent survey of professional forecasters in April 2020, long -term  
(five-year ahead) headline inflation ex pectation was at 1.8 percent and therefore remained 
within the target range of 1.0 – 3.0 percent. This reflected the ability to anchor inflation 
expectations, although headline inflation  continues to decline and has been below the 
lower bound of the target  during the past months.  
Criteria 4:  Persistent decline in demand and employment   
Following the COVID -19 outbreak, economic activities in Thailand  dampened 
significantly due to the implementation of containment measures and a slowdown in 
trading partner ec onomies.  This directly weighed on employment and household 
income,  which then  translated to deteriorating purchasing power  and a contraction in 
domestic demand.  Coupled with the outlook of a slowly recovering global economy,  this then 
led to excess product ion capacity in many industries,  and therefore resulted in  low price 
levels  of goods and services.  Nonetheless, the Committee saw a need to monitor and 
assess whether demand and employment would become persistently subdued  after the 
relaxation of the conta inment measures.   
In summary,  the current economic development  in Thailand did not exhibit signs of 
deflation according to its broad definition. Going forward,  deflation risk could rise, should 
the global as well as the Thai economies face a more -severe co ntraction or a much 
slower recovery than expected. The  Committee would  thus monitor developments of 
the economy and inflation closely , particularly factors which could affect consumption and 
private investment. These include both income  and employment,  as well as household and

 business confidence.  Moreover, the inflation outlook in the period ahead would be highly 
uncertain due to structural changes in the global economy after the COVID -19 outbreak, trade 
tensions and  geopolitical risks  in many parts of the world. These could potentially lead to  
deglobalization, which could have significant impacts on the global supply chains and prices 
of goods. The Committee therefore placed importance on clear and continuous communi cation  
with the public regarding the outlook of inflation and risk of deflation .

 Recent progress on the Bank of Thailand’s financial and credit relief 
measures to relieve impacts of the COVID -19 
In recent periods, the Bank of Thailand (BOT) has been implementing a series of 
measures to address liquidity problems facing households and businesses affected by the 
COVID -19 pandemic. Given high degree of uncertainties surrounding the pandemic, 
particul arly how and when it would end, households and businesses with liquidity problems 
could thus face solvency risks, which would hinder economic recovery after the pandemic. In 
implementing the financial relief measures amidst high uncertainties, the BOT aims  to address 
such problems in accordance with the following key principles.  
1. The supports must reach those affected by the pandemic in a broad -based and 
timely manner.  
2. They must not pose risks to the financial institution system.  
3. They must not cau se excessive fiscal burden on the government or tax burden on  
taxpayers going forward.  
4. They should support the transformation of businesses to prepare for changes in 
consumer behaviors and business operations in the post -COVID environment.  
Recent prog ress on four financial measures implemented thus far can be summarized 
as follows.  
(1) Interest rate cuts  Since February 2020, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has 
delivered three policy rate cuts, and reduced the Financial Institutions Development Fun d 
(FDIF) contribution rate to 0.23 percent of the deposit base for the duration of 2 years. These 
moves enabled financial institutions to cut the reference loan rates  to the lowest level in 16 
years, which helped lower the interest burden for floating -rate loans.  
 In addition, the BOT asked financial institutions to offer a 2 - 4 percent reduction in 
interest rate ceilings, service fees, and penalty charges on fixed -rate credit card and personal 
loans, effective from on August 1, 2020 onwards. Moreover, an  adjustment was made to the 
calculation of late payment fees. Under the new calculation method, interest charges will only 
be applied on the specific installment that was missed, instead of on the entire outstanding 
loan. This new method would reduce inter est burden on borrowers, and reflect the actual loss 
to the lenders.  
(2) Debt payment holiday and debt reduction Empowered by the Emergency Decree 
on the Provision of Financial Assistance for Entrepreneurs Affected by the COVID -19 
Pandemic, B.E. 2563 (2020 ) (Financial Assistance Emergency Decree), the BOT issued a 
loan payment holiday of 6 months for all SMEs  with normal repayment status and a credit 
line not exceeding 100 million baht per financial institution as of end -2019. During the payment 
holiday, th e pause payments will not be considered as missed payment. Furthermore, the 
BOT engaged with the Thai Bankers’ Association to encourage commercial banks to consider 
additional liquidity supports for SMEs beyond measures previously announced.  
 For retail borrowers, including small SMEs who rely on personal loans, auto loans, and 
leasing for working capital to support business operations, on March 26, 2020, the BOT, 
together with financial institutions and non -bank financial services providers,  agreed to adopt 
minimum measures on debt moratorium and debt reduction to assist retail borrowers 
of all loan types for the duration of 3 months . During this period, payment suspensions Monetary Policy Report  June 2020                                                                                                                        40  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 would not be considered as missed payments. These measures would ensure sufficient cash 
flows for retail borrowers to sustain necessary expenditures and continue their business 
operations. Furthermore, financial institutions and other financial services pr oviders continued 
to offer additional measures that were better than the minimum measures. As these phase I 
measures will soon expire, while the COVID -19 situation remains highly uncertain, the BOT 
thus announced the Phase II minimum measures  to assist ret ail borrowers  on June 19, 
2020 to expand the scope and duration of the supports for borrowers affected by the COVID -19. 
This time, financial institutions were urged to offer a set of minimum measures on debt 
restructuring options for borrowers according to their loan types. The options could include, 
for example, minimum repayment reduction, loan maturity extension, or red uction in loan 
installments. Furthermore, financial institutions were asked to not demand repayment of the 
entire loan principal and all interests suspended or installments reduced during the debt 
holiday at once  when the measures expire. Also, late paymen t fees or any other charges will 
not be applied on borrowers participating in this program.  
(3) Additional lending In order to support businesses with liquidity needs and those 
requiring changes to the business operations to prepare for the new economic e nvironment, 
the BOT, authorized by the Financial Assistance Emergency Decree, would provide soft loans 
of 500 billion baht for financial institutions, who would then on -lend the funds to SMEs . To be 
eligible for the loans, SMEs must have a normal repayment  status and a credit line of 
not exceeding 500 million baht with each financial institution as of end -2019 . The 
maximum drawdown for the soft loan is 20% of the loan outstanding as of end -2019, and the 
interest rates on these loans must not exceed 2 percen t13/.  
 The soft loans would be distributed to borrowers across a wide range of sectors14/, 
most notably SMEs (1) in the provinces, (2) in sectors impacted by COVID -19 such as trading, 
manufacturing, and service, (3) of small size with 20 million baht or les s in existing credit lines, 
and (4) rated as medium to high -risks by financial institutions.  
 However, the amount of soft loans granted to date remained small compared to the 
size of the program, which is 500 billion baht. This was partly because financia l institutions 
had already issued some new loans previously using supports from other government 
programs and continued to do so (Chart 1). These programs included the Government 
Savings Bank Soft Loan Scheme15/, which comprised the financial institutions o n-lending 
program and the direct SME lending program, and the credit guarantee facilities by the Thai 
Credit Guarantee Corporation16/. When new loans granted under the BOT soft loan program 
and other government SME loan support programs are combined, the am ount of new loans 
would total over 200 billion baht. Moreover, as the economy began to recover and more 
businesses started to resume operations, the utilization of the BOT soft loans was expected 
to increase, supporting business liquidity needs and recover y.

 With regard to retail borrowers, both existing and new, specialized financial institutions 
have implemented further credit support measures to assist their liquidity needs17/. For 
example, the Government Savings Bank has launched a targeted loan program for freelancers 
and salary workers, while the Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives has 
announced a 20 billion baht emergency loan program for farm households.  
(4) Debt restructuring:  The BOT announced the rela xation of supervisory regulations18/ 
to encourage debt restructuring for business and household borrowers who were not yet 
classified as NPL. Restructuring options may include extension of loan repayment period, 
provision of additional working capital, inte rest reduction, or extension of loan maturity with 
lower interest rates that match declining income profile post -pandemic. Furthermore, the BOT 
relaxed rules in several areas. First, the classification of borrowers where the borrowers who 
were not yet clas sified as NPL can be immediately classified as normal  if they could make 
repayments in accordance with the debt restructuring agreement. This restructuring would be 
considered pre -emptive, instead of Troubled Debt Restructuring (TDR). Moreover, the 
relaxat ion also applied to the classification of NPL borrowers who could comply with the 
restructuring agreement.  Second, the loan loss provision rules were eased to facilitate debt 
restructuring for NPL borrowers.  
The timeline of the debt restructuring program,  as well as the debt holiday and reduction 
measures, are shown in Chart 2.

Looking ahead , the MPC emphasized the need to urge financial institutions to accelerate  
lending, using supports from the various measures implemented, in order to address liquidity 
problems in a targeted and timely manner. Moreover, while the government’s financial and 
fiscal relief measures remain in place to shore up borrowers’ liquidity, financial institutions 
should urgently implement a comprehensive debt restructuring program, particularly  for 
household and SMEs, to make sure that they can make repayments in accordance with the 
debt restructuring agreements. Successful debt restructuring  will contribute significantly to 
economic recovery going forward.

The MPC cut the policy rate to 0.5 percent, the historically low level, in order to provide 
an appropriate and timely support from monetary policy accommodati on 
At the meeting on May 20, 2020, the Committee voted 4 to 3 to cut the policy rate 
by 0.25 percentage point from 0.75 to 0.50 percent. Three members voted to maintain 
the policy rate at 0.75 percent at this meeting.  The Committee viewed that the Thai 
economy would experience a larger contraction in 2020 than previously assessed due to a 
more -severe -than-expected impact of the COVID -19 outbreak and strict  containment 
measures implemented by governments in many countri es including Thailand, which led to 
disruptions of global economic activities. Moreover, the impacts of the economic contraction 
on employment and financial system vulnerability would be more pronounced, as more people 
might be affected than expected, espe cially businesses that were unable to adapt at present 
or in response to changing business structure in the future. This would result in a slow 
economic recovery and a lower long -term potential economic growth. With regard to inflation, 
headline inflation would be more negative than previously assessed. Most members thus 
viewed that additional monetary policy accommodation was necessary to provide an effective 
and timely support to the real economy, as well as reinforce the previously implemented fiscal, 
financial, and credit measures. However, three members voted to maintain the policy rate at 
0.75 percent, focusing on expediting the effectiveness of the announced financial and credit 
measures. Some members deemed it appropriate to wait to assess the effect iveness of the 
announced measures, as well as the outlook of the economy and the outbreak following the 
relaxation of the containment measures before implementing additional financial measures in 
the period ahead.   
 At the meeting on June 24, 2020, the Co mmittee voted  unanimously to maintain 
the policy rate at 0.50 percent. The Committee assessed that the Thai economy would 
contract in 2020 more than the previous assessment but would gradually recover in the second 
half of 2020 in line with improving econo mic activities in many countries, including Thailand, 
that could effectively contain the outbreak. Meanwhile, headline inflation would be more 
negative than previously assessed but would return to the target in 2021. The Committee 
viewed that the extra acc ommodative monetary policy since the beginning of the year as well 
as the fiscal, financial, and credit measures additionally announced helped alleviate adverse 
impacts and would support the economic recovery after the pandemic subsided. These would 
facilitate the return of inflation to the target, and reduce financial stability risks.   
In determining the appropriate course of monetary policy, details on the key assessment 
are as follows.  
Financial system stability became more vulnerable in line with the ec onomic conditions  
 Financial system stability became more vulnerable in line with the economic conditions.  
The Committee deemed it necessary to monitor the followings. First, asset prices in global 
and Thai financial markets might experience sharp correct ions as a result of changes in 
investors’ perspectives toward the global economic outlook, especially those regarding the 
COVID -19 outbreak and trade tensions between the U.S. and China. In addition, corporate 
bonds might be downgraded to non -investment gr ade, which might result in forced selling Monetary Policy Report  June 2020                                                                                                                        44 especially among investors that were subject to the policy on minimum risk tolerance. Second, 
debt servicing ability of businesses and households could deteriorate as global and Thai 
economies could contract more t han expected, and some government relief measures would 
soon phase out, particularly remedy and living expense relief measures. This might result in 
higher non -performing loans and affect financial institutions stability. In this regard, the Bank 
of Thaila nd had announced the second phase of measures to support retail borrowers affected 
by the COVID -19. This would readily reduce risks of defaults.  
Looking ahead, additional measures should be prepared for the highly uncertain COVID -19 
outbreak and rising default risks of businesses and households  
The fiscal, financial and credit measures recently announced helped ease the impacts 
of the COVID -19 outbreak on the private sector. However, financial system stability became 
more vulnerable given highly uncertai n economic outlook due to the COVID -19 situation. Thus, 
the implementation of financial and credit measures in the period ahead should place 
importance on the followings. First, liquidity in the financial system, which remained 
ample at the macroeconomic l evel, should be efficiently distributed to businesses and 
households affected by the pandemic,  by expediting credit extensions through several 
measures previously announced. Second, debt restructuring for borrowers, especially 
households and SMEs, should b e accelerated in order to create widespread impacts 
while debt holidays and debt reduction measures were still in place. Third, pre -emptive 
measures were necessary to cope with solvency risks of households and businesses. 
This should take into account the differences in recovery potentials and competitiveness 
among various groups of households and businesses after the outbreak subsided. The 
Committee deemed it important to establish mechanisms to expedite multi -creditor debt 
restructuring, as well as expand  roles of asset management companies (AMCs) in warehousing 
NPLs in the financial system to be appropriately managed. Fourth, maintaining sound 
financial institutions stability would be necessary  to cope with uncertainties in the future 
and ensure the credi t extension ability to restore the Thai economy after the COVID -19 
outbreak situation subsided. Nevertheless, the BOT had requested for cooperation from 
commercial banks to suspend interim dividend payments in 2020 and stock buybacks, and 
any early redempt ion or purchases of debt instruments qualified as tier -1 or tier -2 capital prior 
to their maturities. This would ensure that commercial banks continue to maintain sufficient 
capital until the new capital fund management plan would be revised in response to  the impacts 
of the outbreak and changing patterns of business operations after the outbreak subsided.   
Targeted labor policies would help lessen the impacts of the COVID -19 outbreak on the 
long-term potential economic growth  
The Committee expressed concer ns over the employment outlook which could 
significantly decline and would take a long period of time before returning to normal, 
both for workers and the self -employed. Some workers were expected to be temporarily 
unemployed particularly during when conta inment measures were still in place. Meanwhile, 
some workers would be more affected and face difficulties in returning to the labor market 
even after the outbreak subsided, especially those in recently -graduated, old -aged, and 
unskilled groups. This was be cause businesses had high level of excess capacity and thus 
adjusted by increasingly adopting digital technology and automation in the production process. 
This would result in economic scars on the long -term potential economic growth.  Monetary Policy Report  June 2020                                                                                                                        45 In recent periods, th e government had continuously implemented measures to remedy 
affected workers. Looking ahead, as the government relaxed containment measures and 
started to boost domestic demand and tourism in order to restore economic activities, 
labor policies should ada pt their roles from remedying affected workers to creating jobs 
and accelerating upskill of workers, as well as wage subsidies for businesses to 
maintain employment. Nevertheless, design of labor policies in the period ahead should not 
only focus on widesp read support, but should also be targeted. This would partly help reduce 
the economic scars caused by the COVID -19, and support a strong and sustainable economic 
restructuring. (Box: Restoring Thailand’s labor markets from impacts of the COVID -19) 
There was still fiscal policy space to facilitate restoration and restructuring of the economy 
such that the government should place importance on supply -side policies to support 
economic restructuring to be able to recover in the new economic landscape after th e 
COVID -19 pandemic subsided  
 The Committee assessed that there remained fiscal policy space to support 
economic restoration and restructuring in the period ahead. This was reflected in 
Thailand’s low level of public debt prior to the COVID -19 outbreak wit h average debt maturities 
of 10 years, most of which were denominated in Thai baht. Nevertheless, fiscal measures and 
public investment must be major tools in shoring up the economy, as well as reducing risks of 
substantial economic contraction to the leve l that would pose risks to economic and financial 
system stability. Such implementation of measures could increase the level of public debt -to-
GDP ratio, despite at a manageable level. Supporting factors would come from considerably low 
government’s fundin g costs in line with lower government bond yields following a series of policy 
rate cuts.  
Nevertheless, government should focus on policies to upgrade the potential growth 
for long -term benefits. Particularly, government should accelerate  the implementati on of 
supply -side policies to support economic restructuring and changing patterns of 
business operations to the new economic landscape. This was because businesses in each 
sector would face varying manners of recovery and challenges for the adjustments af ter the 
outbreak subsided. This might lead some industries to be unable to fully recover and have 
excess capacity. The government would need to (1) establish mechanisms to manage excess 
capacity in industries such as policies to facilitate consolidation am ong businesses with 
substantial excess capacity especially in tourism -related industries or policies to promote 
adjustments of business models to the post -COVID environment, (2) design policies to support 
and enhance the competitiveness of high -potential t argeted industries with fast recovery 
potential after the pandemic subsided such as providing incentives for the private sector to 
invest through the fiscal, financial, and credit measures, as well as relaxing government 
regulations regarding business oper ations, (3) expedite infrastructure investment especially 
public -private partnership projects both within and outside the Eastern Economic Corridor 
(EEC), together with infrastructure for the digital economy, (4) facilitate reskilling and upskilling 
of lab or to support employment in targeted industries and adjustments to the post -COVID 
environment, and (5) accelerate reform of government regulations that are outdated or 
obstructive to the adjustments of businesses to the new economic landscape.  (Box: Roles of 
public policies in restoring the Thai economy amid the highly uncertain COVID -19 outbreak)

Looking ahead, the Committee would monitor developments of econom ic growth, 
inflation, and financial stability, together with associated risks, including external risks, the 
impacts of the COVID -19 outbreak, and the effectiveness of fiscal, financial, and credit 
measures, as well as the baht situation which might affect  the economic recovery in 
deliberating monetary policy going forward. The Committee would stand ready to use additional  
appropriate policy tools if necessary.

amid the highly uncertain COVID -19 outbreak   
 The COVID -19 outbreak led to unprecedentedly severe impact on the economy and 
the way of life. Consequently, governments worldwide had to impose strict containment 
measures to control the spread of the virus, causing temporary disruptions to economic 
activities across several sectors. It was the first time in the history that almost all economic 
engines shut down simultaneously. It could thus take several years before economic activities 
return to the pre -pande mic level.  
 However, the Thai economy, compared to others, still have strong buffers in various 
aspects. (1) External stability remained solid , with high levels of current account surplus 
and international reserves, as well as a low level of external debt to GDP. (2) Fiscal space 
remained adequate  for the government to provide relief measures and support economic 
recovery, with public debt outstanding at 43 percent of GDP in April 2020, well below the 
international benchmark of 60 percent. (3) Financial ins titutions stability remained robust , 
as reflected in high levels of commercial banks’ capital funds and reserves.  
 Despite the presence of these strong buffers, vulnerabilities existed in certain sectors. 
In particular, household debt remained high. SMEs a lso faced intensifying competition from 
large businesses, e -commerce and rapid technological changes. These existing vulnerabilities 
were aggravated by the COVID -19 situation. Hence, the use of abovementioned buffers would 
be crucial to shore up the econom y in the period ahead. Policymakers would need to take 
into account current key challenges, as well as should be forward -looking to changing 
environment after the COVID -19 outbreak subsides. Roles of public policies should 
address the following aspects:  
1. Role in providing short -term economic support  
 The public sector has employed 
buffers of the fiscal and financial institutions  
to urgently provide liquidity support and 
ease financial burdens of households and 
businesses, especially in the initial phase 
when a la  rge number of people were affected 
by the COVID -19 containment measures. The 
government introduced large -scale relief 
measures to alleviate and remedy those 
affected by the outbreak in the short run. 
Meanwhile, the Bank of Thailand cut the 
policy  rate to th  e historically low level and 
introduced credit measures to assist borrowers 
through financial  institutions, such as debt 
repayment moratorium and reduction, debt restructuring, and soft loans. Such policy 
synchronization would help support the Thai economic recovery in the medium term, in line 
with the  baseline projection ( the blue line in Chart 1).  
 As the baseline projection suggested, despite the massive government stimulus,  
it would take some time before the Thai economy could return to the pre -COVID -19 
level.  This was because the income shock has a long -term impact on the private s ector’s

business models in response to the new norma l where people became more concerned on 
health safety, at least until vaccines and medicines become readily available. Hence, in the 
next period in which the outbreak would be contained and the government starts to 
relax containment measures, public polici es would have a vital role in supporting the 
economic recovery toward the pre -pandemic level. Fiscal and supply -side policies, 
together with financial and credit measures, would be of particular importance.  
2. Role in mitigating risk of the worst case sce nario and maintaining the long -term potential of 
the Thai economy.  
 The worst case scenario should be developed in order to prepare for risks that could 
arise amid the highly uncertain global environment, as well as assess the adequacy of buffers, 
especial ly if the economy contracts significantly this year and is unable to recover to its 
previous growth path in the medium term  (the red line in Chart 1). This could happen as a 
result of (1) external factors, such as the global spread of COVID -19 which could cause a 
more severe and prolonged global economic contraction, and trade tensions between the U.S. 
and China that could intensify and further weigh on Thai exports and tourism, and (2) domestic 
factors, such as the second wave of the COVID -19 outbreak that  could prompt the government 
to re -introduce strict containment measures and prevent the introduction of travel bubbles. 
This worst case scenario did not include additional government measures to be implemented. 
Thus, economic developments and the COVID -19 situation should be closely monitored 
through real -time economic indicators.  
 Should the worst case scenario materialize, the damage would not be limited 
only to the short -term impact, but would also leave the long -term economic scars even 
after the outbr eak subsides. This would, in turn, cause Thailand’s potential economic 
growth to decline (the orange dotted line in Chart 1). The long -term impact could stem from 
risks in both the economy and the financial system. Examples include, first, some businesses 
may become bankrupt and permanently closed, while businesses that survive may decide to 
reduce or delay their inv estments. Second, many businesses may reduce employment, 
causing workers to face greater difficulties in finding new jobs, especially those who lack the 
skills required by other industries. Third, there could be massive defaults of corporates and 
household s, resulting in much higher levels of non -performing loans (NPL) and rendering 
inadequate commercial banks’ capital and loan loss provision to cover risks from new loans in 
the period ahead. This could cause a macro -financial negative feedback loop on the economy  
in the long term.  
 Although the existing buffers remained strong, the public sector should optimize the 
use of these buffers to ensure the fullest efficiency and should be prepared for any case of 
emergency. An emphasis should be given to factors that could have an extensive impact on 
financial institutions, businesses and households, and to variables with large multiplier effects 
or high linkage with various sectors of the economy. To mitigate the risk of the worst case 
scenario and enhance Thaila nd’s potential economic growth, it is imperative to focus 
on the following issues:  
1. Preventing the spillover of economic problems to the financial system, both 
financial markets and financial institutions system. The Bank of Thailand accelerated 
certain actions which include the followings. First, a timely implementation of measures was 
done to stabilize the financial markets in order to shore up investor confidence and reduce 
financial market volatility, such as purchases of government bonds to maintain liquidity in the Monetary Policy Report  June 2020                                                                                                                        49  bond market, the establishment of the Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (MFLF) and the Corporate 
Bond Stabilization Fund (BSF).  Second, financial institutions were encouraged to expedite 
debt restructuring to ensure that borrowers would be able to repay their debt under the revised 
conditions, which would reduce risk of NPL and help support the stability of financial 
institutions system. Third, the Bank of Thailand requested cooperation from commercial banks 
to suspend interim dividend pa yments in 2020, stock buybacks, and any early redemption or 
purchases of debt instruments qualified as tier -1 or tier -2 capital prior to their maturities to 
ensure that commercial banks sustain strong capital. Such implementation would help shore 
up confid ence in the financial markets and financial institutions system, as well as ensure 
sound preparation for coping with the risks in the future.  
2. Designing supply -side policies to support the economic restructuring both 
policies related to business operatio n, capital reallocation, and labor to be consistent 
with the post -COVID environment. Once the COVID -19 outbreak subsides, businesses in 
different sectors would face varying manners of recovery and difficulties regarding adjustment. 
This might lead some ind ustries to be unable to fully recover and have excess capacity.  
The government should, first, establish mechanism to manage excess capacity in the Thai 
manufacturing  sector, such as policies to facilitate mergers and acquisitions among businesses 
with sub stantial excess capacity, particularly those in tourism -related businesses, or policies 
to promote adjustments of business models to suit the post -COVID environment. Second, the 
design of policies to support and enhance the competitiveness of high -potentia l targeted 
industries with fast recovery potential after the pandemic subsides could be done through, for 
example, providing incentives through the use of fiscal, financial, and credit measures for the 
private sector to invest, as well as relaxing governme nt regulations that remain obstructive to 
business operations. Third, the government should also expedite infrastructure investment 
especially public -private partnership projects both within and outside the Eastern Economic 
Corridor (EEC), together with in frastructure for the digital economy. Fourth, reskilling and 
upskilling of workers should be promoted to support employment in targeted industries and 
adjustments of businesses to suit the post -COVID environment. Fifth, reforms of government 
regulations th at are outdated or obstructive to the adjustments of businesses to the new 
economic landscape should be accelerated.  
 In conclusion, although Thailand is currently able to contain the spread of COVID -19 
and has adequate buffers to implement financial and f iscal measures to address the impacts 
of the COVID -19, it is however necessary to stand ready to introduce measures to cope with 
risks in the period ahead in a more targeted, timely and effective manner. This would ensure 
adequate buffers and reduce risk o f economic scars should the worst case scenario 
materialize. In addition, this would help sustain the long -term potential economic growth. The 
implementation of these measures would require policy synchronization between public health 
policies, the fiscal,  financial and credit measures, as well as supply -side policies, in order to 
support economic restructuring to be consistent with the COVID -19 situation in a given period.

  Restoring Thailand’s labor markets from  
impacts of the COVID -19  
The COVID -19 situation significantly affected economic activities and Thai labor 
markets. During the beginning of the outbreak, some businesses had to temporarily suspend 
business operations, which resulted in a widespread impact on labor. At pre sent, the 
government was successful in containing the spread and thus, businesses could gradually 
resume operations. However, given the highly uncertain situation as well as changing 
business models under the new normal, this could add pressures on the rec overy of domestic 
demand and labor markets. Measures  in the period ahead should support the adjustments  
of labor to foster long -term sustainable economic growth.     
During the beginning of the outbreak, most labor policies were short -term measures 
to reme dy affected workers. These measures can be divided into 2 groups according to the 
status in the Social Security System. (Chart 1) (1) Workers in the Social Security System have 
been remedied according to their rights such as rights to receive compensation from the Social 
Security Fund in the event of unemployment,19   job termination due to force majeure,20   or 
temporary suspension of business operation according to section 75 that is not due to force 
majeure .21 According to the latest data in June 2020, the So cial Security Fund has remedied 
approximately 2 million affected workers. (2) Workers outside the Social Security System 
have been assisted by the government through formal registration or application 
platform, such as    million freelancers under the “Rao  Mai Ting Gun” (You will never be left 
behind) project, as well as 8 million farmers, that were entitled to receive benefits of 5,000 
baht for 3 months, and employment of newly graduates as demanded by government agencies .

 As for the second phase that the government began to successfully contain the 
spread  (Chart 2), the government has relaxed the containment measures and implemented 
measures to boost consumption and domestic tourism to restore economic activities and 
facilitate employ ment of businesses. However, workers could be severely affected and find it 
difficult to return to the labor markets. These include workers in businesses with excess 
production capacity due to severe impacts and in businesses that adopted automation in the  
production process, as well as the newly graduated, aging, and low -skilled workers. 
Therefore, labor policies should adapt their roles from remedying to employing and 
enhancing skills of labor.  (Chart 2) These policies include (1) job creation policy  to support 
unemployed and newly -graduated workers, especially employment at the community level due 
to public work for local economy development, which would partly help create job for non -farm 
workers to return home, (2) labor skill development policy along w ith subsidies to motivate 
workers to reskill and upskill through various learning channels including online training 
platforms,22/ which can be continuously implemented in the long run so that workers will be 
familiar with lifelong learning and immuned to s urvive in the era of high uncertainties, (3) wage 
subsidies for businesses to support employment in the case that businesses does not cut 
employment or cut to the level not exceeding the specified threshold. This would ensure that 
workers remain employed a nd businesses could still operate. In recent periods, the government  
has already implemented some of these policies, where the Social Security Fund would 
compensate workers on behalf of the employers in case of job termination due to force 
majeure. Neverth eless, wage subsidies should be implemented together with providing 
incentives for the private sector to adjust to the new normal, including the move toward the 
digital economy, the aging society, and modern services.

new skills through online training platform.People are able to find new jobs in businesses that 
recovered from the pandemic or employed to do public work  
such as infrastructure project for the local communitySupply -side policies would support the economic 
restructuring and improvement of the potential economic 
growth in be consistent with the post -COVID environment.
1)Remedial measures for

outside the social 
security system2)Labor skill development
3)Job creation through employment 
in public work such as for local 
economy development
4)Wage subsidies for businesses to 
maintain employment and offer 
new jobsPolicyChart 2 Labor policies after the COVID -19 outbreak subsides should focus on stimulating the economy, creating 
jobs, and promoting an upskill of labor to support changing economic structure in response to the new economic 
landscape
Policy
technology incentive regulation 
The design of policies should be in line with the labor market context and long -term 
structural improvements such as ages and labor skills of affected workers, targeted industries.
Mechanism s tools to facilitate effective labor policies
•Full-scale digital economy  such as 
smart farmer/ SME
•Infrastructures to support the aging 
society
•Improvement in manufacturing, trade 
and services sectors that are 
economically important (S -Curve/ 
modern services )New normalMonetary Policy Report  June 2020                                                                                                                        52  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  Nevertheless, the design of labor policies in the period ahead should not only 
focus on widespread support, but should also be appropriately and clearly targeted, 
such as ages and skills of labors, as well as targeted industries through wage subsidies for 
businesses to support employment. The support should aim at small - and medium -sized 
businesses in S -curve and New S -curve industries that would employ young -aged workers or 
the first -jobbers so that this group of workers will be allowed to enhance skills, especially digital skills.   
More importantly, policy makers should push forward broad -based measures 
that will be most effective through 3 key development mechanisms. These include (1) 
technology development,  where cooperation between the government and pr ivate sector is 
necessary including job -search platform and upskilling of labor to match with job vacancies, 
as well as suggestions on labor skills to be further enhanced, (2) provision of incentives for 
workers and employers to participate in skill develo pment policy as needed or according  
to the national strategic plan including  allowing employers to link data on job vacancies, 
qualifications, and labor skills needed with the platform so that the system could correctly 
match unemployed workers with job va cancies, (3) adjustment of some regulations to suit 
the new normal  including hourly employment or more flexible employment .   
In conclusion, the government has implemented measures to remedy both workers 
within and outside the Social Security System affected during the beginning of the outbreak to 
a certain level. In the period ahead, labor policies would be more important in res toring and 
boosting the economy through job creation policy, skill development policy, and wage subsidies  
for businesses to support employment. This would partly help mitigate the economic scars 
from the impact of COVID -19 and support the strong and sustai nable economic restructuring.

Governments in many countries worldwide implemented containment measures to control the 
spread of COVID -19, causing disruptions to global economic activities, especially in major 
advanced economies and Asian economies. Also, the Chinese economy grew at a s lower 
pace. However, the series of financial and fiscal measures that had been implemented so far 
would help alleviate the economic impact and support recovery in the coming periods.

In light of the COVID -19 pandemic that became more severe and widespread, the Thai 
economy in the first quarter of 2020 contracted due to both international and domestic 
demand. Also, in the second quarter of 2020, the Thai economy was projected to contract 
sharply as a result of strict co ntainment measures both in Thailand and abroad .

Headline inflation was negative in April and May mainly owing to the decline in energy prices. 
However, it was expected to be less negative in June on account of rising energy and fresh 
food prices. Meanwhile, core inflation softened due to the reduction i n electricity and water 
bills, which was part of the government’s measures to ease the burden on households. 
Regarding inflation expectation, short -term expectations edged up while long -term expectations  
declined slightly.

Short -term money market rates, lending rates, and deposit rates declined persistently, in line 
with the reduction in the policy rate and the Financial Institutions Development Fund (FIDF) 
contribution. Short -term government bond yields  fell, but the government bond yield curve 
steepened as long -term yields fell by less than short -term yields. Meanwhile, corporate bond 
yields continued to increase. Private sector financing accelerated on account of the need for 
liquidity buffer among bus inesses affected by the COVID -19 pandemic, and also as a result 
of the government’s soft loan programs for SMEs. However, household credit growth 
continued to soften. With regard to exchange rates, the baht against the U.S. dollar and the 
effective exchang e rate appreciated throughout the second quarter, owing to the relaxation of 
containment measures in the region and sales of the U.S. dollars by domestic players.

The price -to-earning (P/E) ratio of the  Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) and the Market for 
Alternative Investment (mai) declined at the end of the first quarter of 2020 due to investors’ 
concerns over the COVID -19 situation and the development of the oil price. However, the ratio 
returned to t he level close to historical average in May. New issuance of corporate bonds 
softened, as some issuers switched to commercial bank credits following the rise in funding 
cost in the corporate bond market and the decline in investors’ risk appetite. Also, in  May 2020, 
some investment grade issuers in tourism -related sectors affected by COVID -19 received 
credit rating downgrades, raising the share of non -investment grade bonds.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Stability: Household sector  
Household financial positions and debt servic ing ability deteriorated, as reflected in the 
household debt -to-GDP ratio in the first quarter of 2020, which rose slightly from the already -
high level. Also, NPL ratio (Stage 3) increased in all types of loans, especially credit card 
loans, partly as a re sult of COVID -19 impact on economic activities .

Overall vulnerabilities in the corporate sector increased in the first quarter of 2020, especially 
among large corporates impacted by oil price decline and merchandise export contraction. 
This was reflected by deteriorating debt servicing ability of large corporates, including in the 
return on assets (ROA) and operating profit margin (OPM) of listed companies. The rising NPL 
among SMEs, particularly in manufacturing, trading, as well as hotel and restaurant sectors, 
should be closely monitored.

The real estate sector faced a risk from the continuous decline in demand for residential 
properties  from domestic and foreign buyers amidst the COVID -19 pandemic. Developers thus 
delayed launches of new projects in the first quarter of 2020, especially for condominium projects.

The financial position of financial institutions remained robust, as reflected by adequately high 
levels of commercial banks’ reserves and capital buffers to cushion against risks of credit 
quality deterioration. Nevertheless, overall NPL ratios in the commercial banking system  rose 
in the first quarter of 2020, particularly among consumer loans, in line with economic conditions .

reserves and the low level of external debt to GDP ratio compared to international benchmark. 
This would help the Thai economy stay resilient against volatilities in the global financial market.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Stability: Fiscal sector
