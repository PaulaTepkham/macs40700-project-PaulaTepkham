4/53Table of ContentsExecutive Summary
Inflation
Headline inflation is expected to gradually decline towards the target range, averaging 
at 2.5% in 2023 and 2.4% in 2024 due to easing supply pressures from lower domestic electricity and 
diesel prices as well as government subsidies (Box 1: Thailand’s disinflation process in the Asian 
context ). However, core inflation would remain elevated, averaging at 2.0% in both 2023 and 
2024. This is in line with underlying inflation indicators remaining high despite some slowdown. 
At the same time, core inflation is driven importantly by components which have been highly 
persistent namely food in core components, whose prices remain on an upward trajectory. Looking 
ahead, the inflation outlook is still subject to upside risks including (1) mounting demand 
pressures given the backdrop of expanding economic activities, particularly if tourism recovery or 
fiscal stimulus under the new government’s economic policies proves stronger than expected; and 
(2) a higher and faster -than-expected cost pass -through given persistently high production costs 
that were partly absorbed by producers in the past. In this context, further supply pressures could 
also have implications for price -setting behavior. Medium -term inflation expectations are still 
well-anchored within the target range. Global Economy
Trading partners are expected to grow 2.6% in 2023 and 2.7% in 2024. The outlook for 
the US and euro area economies have continued to improve on the back of growth in the services 
sector. The Chinese economy saw robust growth following its reopening, resulting in improvements 
in domestic consumption and activities in the services sector. Meanwhile, China ’s manufacturing 
sector and imports are still recovering at a gradual pace due to high level of manufacturing 
inventories, limiting the reopening ’s spillover benefits to other Asian economies. Looking ahead, 
trading partner economies would continue to expand as global demand recovers. Nonetheless, the 
global economic outlook is still subject to risks stemming from the lagging effects of major 
central banks ’ monetary policy actions as well as lingering geopolitical risks, which would pose 
implications for monetary policy and global economic growth in the period ahead.  
The Thai Economy
The Thai economy is expected to continue expanding, growing 3.6% in 2023 and 3.8% 
in 2024. Growth would be driven by ( 1) a continued recovery in tourism as reflected by the 
increasing number of foreign tourist arrivals across almost all nationalities, especially the Malaysian 
and European. Foreign tourist arrivals are expected to reach 29.0 and 35.5 million in 2023 and 
2024, respectively; and (2) a continued expansion in private consumption in line with the 
recovery in tourism which would result in more broad -based improvements in overall employment 
and labor income, notably in the services sector and among self -employed workers. Nonetheless, 
merchandise exports, which had contracted since the end of 2022, are recovering gradually 
and should pick up pace in the second half of 2023 thanks to China ’s reopening and 
improvement in trading partners ’ growth. This would provide an impetus for growth through to 
2024. Upside risks to Thailand ’s growth outlook include the higher -than-expected foreign tourist 
arrivals and a stronger stimulus from the new governments ’ economic policies. 
5/53Executive Summary
Financial Conditions and Financial Stability
Overall financial conditions turned somewhat less accommodative . Private 
sector funding costs have increased as commercial banks’ interest rates and Thai 
government bond yields rose in tandem with the policy rate (Box 2: Monetary policy 
transmission to commercial banks’ interest rates ).Long-term government bond yields 
increased slightly partly influenced by higher US Treasury yields due to monetary policy 
normalization and uncertainties pertaining to the US debt ceiling. Nonetheless, financing 
costs in the bond market remain largely unchanged with foreign investors’ demand for 
Thai long -term bonds remaining intact and credit spreads remaining largely stable. In 
terms of financing volume, businesses are still able to mobilize funds with private credit 
growth remaining positive despite some slowdown due mainly to debt repayments. 
Meanwhile, some large corporates have issued more bonds with corporate bond 
issuances reaching a 3 -year high. On exchange rates, the baht against the US dollar 
depreciated slightly from the previous quarter. The baht depreciation was driven by 
market expectations on the Fed’s monetary policy, the renminbi depreciation, and 
domestic political uncertainties. 
The overall financial system remains resilient with financial institutions maintaining
high levels of capital and loan loss provision. Debt serviceability of businesses and 
households has also improved in line with the economic recovery. Nonetheless, financial 
fragilities remain for some SMEs and households that are exposed to rising living costs 
and higher debt burden. The MPC sees the need to continue implementing debt 
restructuring measures with an emphasis on rolling out measures that would address 
debt problems of the vulnerable groups in a well targeted and sustainable manner.Monetary Policy Decisions in the Second Quarter of 2023
At the meeting on 31 May 2023, the MPC voted unanimously to raise the policy 
rate by 0.25 percentage point from 1.75% to 2.00%. The MPC deems a continuation of 
gradual policy normalization to be appropriate in light of the growth and inflation outlook. 
The MPC expects the Thai economy to continue expanding, driven mainly by tourism and 
private consumption. Merchandise exports are expected to recover gradually. Headline 
inflation has returned to the target range, but there remains upside risks stemming from 
mounting demand pressures amid expanding economic activities and higher cost pass -
through from supply pressures, in part  contingent on government economic policies looking 
ahead. The overall financial system remains resilient but there is still a need to closely 
monitor financial market developments and volatilities, as well as debt serviceability of SMEs 
and low -income households with large debt burden.   
Under the prevailing monetary policy framework, the MPC seeks to maintain price 
stability, support sustainable growth in line with potential, and preserve financial stability. In 
the view of these objectives, the MPC expects a steady economic expansion but sees a 
need to monitor upside risks to inflation. The MPC thus decided to increase the policy 
interest rate to normalize the monetary policy stance in a gradual and measured 
manner toward a level consistent with long -term sustainable growth. The MPC is 
prepared to adjust the size and timing of policy normalization should the evolving 
growth and inflation outlook differ from the current assessment.
6/53Global economy
The global economy would continue to 
expand driven mainly by the services 
sector, especially in the US, euro area , 
and China. However , China’s reopening 
would have a limited spillover benefits 
toother Asian economies. Persistently high inflation started to 
abate in many countries, prompting 
most central banks to keep their 
policy rates on hold.Trading partners ’ growth outlook 
faces downside risks from the lagging 
effects of monetary policy actions, 
banking stresses in advanced 
economies, and geopolitical tensions. 
Global Economy: Key Issues
7/53Global economy
The global economy is expected to continue expanding in 2023 driven mainly by the services sector. 
Meanwhile, manufacturing activities are expected to slow in tandem with global demand. 
The global economy would continue to expand mainly on the back of 
economic activities in the services sector and sound US economic 
fundamentals particularly consumption and labor market. 
Meanwhile, manufacturing activities in many countries would slow in line 
with global demand amid concerns over persistently high inflation which could 
prompt a further monetary policy tightening.

Economic activities in China would continue to expand supported by consumption and activities in the services sector such as restaurants and tourism. 
The real estate sector is also gradually recovering with the construction sector expected to continue expanding looking ahead . China’s exports growth remains strong 
despite some slowdown after having accelerated in the earlier period, especially exports to G3 and BRICS. However, manufactur ingactivities and imports are still 
recovering at a gradual pace, partly due to high level of manufacturing inventories. The Chinese economy would continue to gain traction supported by consumption and activities in the services sector.

Asian merchandise exports have yet to see a firm recovery especially electronics due to muted global demand and 
high level of inventories. However, exports are expected to pick up pace in the second half of 2023.
Asian exports have yet to see a firm recovery due to limited spillover benefits from China ’s reopening. Overall, Asian exports are still declining, especially 
exports of electronics, as global demand is still weighed down by inflationary pressures. The decline is also partly due to h ighlevel of manufacturing inventories 
as inventory rundowns are still proceeding at a gradual pace. Nonetheless, merchandise exports to key trading partners saw slight improvements in the recent period. 
Asian exports are expected to bottom out in Q 3/2023 and would gradually recover as electronics exports are likely to pick up as inventories decline.

The Federal Reserve (Fed) raised its policy rate by 25 bps to 5.00-5.25% at the FOMC 
Meeting on 3 May 2023. The decision was underpinned by the continued economic 
expansion and strong labor market conditions. Meanwhile, inflation in the US is receding but 
remains high overall. Looking ahead, the Fed ’s decision would be dependent on inflation 
risks and employment. The Fed also stands ready to utilize other policy tools to support the 
US banking system so that it could effectively tighten monetary policy as warranted by 
overall economic conditions. In this regard, the BOT has revised down its forecast for the 
federal funds rate by 25 bps throughout the forecast period on account of tighter financial 
conditions in the US posing risks to economic activities in the period ahead. 
The Eu ropean Central Bank (ECB) raised its policy rate by 25 bps to 3.25% at the 
Governing Council Meeting on 4 May 2023 as inflationary pressures remain elevated. The 
ECB also signaled that it would end the reinvestments under the Asset Purchase Program 
(APP) in July 2023. Looking ahead, the ECB is likely to continue raising policy rate with a 
data-dependent approach. The ECB also stressed its readiness to deploy new tools to 
support commercial banks should liquidity problems arise in the European financial system.
Most Asian central banks have stopped raising policy rates such as Bank Negara Malaysia, 
Bank Indonesia, and the Bank of Korea as headline inflation in those countries have started 
to slow down. Nonetheless, persistently high core inflation remains a risk factor that central 
banks would continue to monitor going forward.

Trading partners’ growth forecast for 2023 is revised up slightly on account of a gradual demand recovery among advanced
economies and China. For 2024, trading partners would continue to expand in line with the recovery in global demand.
Trading partners ’ growth forecast for 2023 is revised up slightly. In particular, t he US is 
projected to see a stronger economic recovery as reflected in better -than-expected Q 1/2023 
growth outturns and ongoing improvements seen in most recent economic indicators .The 
Chinese economy is also expected to gain further traction after the country ’s reopening with 
consumption and the services sector providing the main growth momentum this year. For 2024, 
trading partners would continue to expand in line with the recovery in global demand despite 
a slight downward revision to the growth forecast on account of elevated inflation and tighter 
financial conditions, which would affect economic activities.  
Overall, risks to trading partners’ growth outlook are skewed to the downside.
Downside risks: (1) Slower -than-expected global economic recovery due to lagging effects of 
monetary policy actions, and sharper -than-expected decline in global trade; (2) Impacts of 
financial stability risks on the global economy such as banking stresses in advanced economies and 
tighter -than-expected financial conditions; (3) Geopolitical tensions especially between US -
China that could escalate further due to the Tech War as well as the prolonged China -Taiwan 
and Russia -Ukraine conflicts. 
Upside risks: Stronger -than-expected growth among Asian economies due to (1) a strong recovery
in the services sector thanks to the resumption in international travel, especially tourist arrivals 
from China; and (2) a stronger -than-expected economic growth in China boosting Asian exports.

Foreign 
tourist arrivalsRevised up from 28 million to 29 million persons in 2023 on account of better -than-expected outturns in foreign tourist arrivals 
and tourism indicators. Meanwhile, recovery in tourist arrivals from China was largely in line with expectation and the short age
of ground staff at airports is likely to be resolved. Foreign tourist arrivals would continue to recover in 2024 with projected 
number of foreign tourists being revised up from 35 million to 35.5 million persons on account of improved tourism confidence . 
Private 
consumptionRevised up on account of better -than-expected outturns driven by growth momentum in the services sector, which would in 
turn benefit employment and labor income, especially self -employed workers and workers in tourism -related sectors. Private 
consumption would continue to expand in 2024 as household purchasing power improves in line with labor income. 
Merchandise 
exports (Value)Merchandise exports would register a smaller contraction than the previous forecast partly due to better -than-expected 
gold exports. Merchandise exports (excluding gold) would recover at a gradual pace due to limited benefits from trading 
partners’ growth being driven by the services sector, and China’s greater reliance on its domestic production capabilities. 
Nonetheless, exports of electrical appliances are expected to pick up due to warmer weather in many countries. Exports of 
agricultural and agro -manufacturing products would also continue to grow on the back of demand from China. Exports of 
electronics are expected to see a stronger recovery in the second half of 2023 and become a growth driver for exports in 2024 . 
Private 
investmentRevised down in 2023 on account of some public private partnership (PPP) projects being delayed due to contractual issues 
that will have to be reviewed by the new government. Nonetheless, private investment is expected to pick up and post a 
strong growth in 2024 as many infrastructure projects would commence along with investments in new target industries such 
as EV and BCG, which have seen increased approvals by BOI for large corporates. Private investment would also be supported 
by resumption in export growth. Summary of economic forecasts

•Revised up foreign tourist arrivals forecast for 2023 to 29.0 million persons 
on account of better -than-expected outturns across almost all nationalities, 
especially Malaysian and European tourists, and tourism indicators. The upward 
revision is also underpinned by the increasing number of flights to Thailand 
partly as the shortage of ground staff at airports has resolved, which would 
support the recovery in foreign tourist arrivals in the period ahead. 
•Revised up foreign tourist arrivals forecast for 2024 to 35.5 million on 
account of the momentum being carried forward from 2023 due to improved 
tourism confidence and a gradual increase in the number of flights towards 
pre-COVID levels. Foreign tourist arrivals forecasts are revised up on account of higher -than-expected outturns in Q1/2023 especially European

Merchandise exports would recover in tandem with trading partners’ growth and should pick up pace in the second half 
of 2023
•Merchandise exports in Q1/2023 were higher than expected. This was mainly 
owing to higher export quantities driven by increased exports of agricultural and 
agro-manufacturing products thanks to China’s reopening, and increased exports 
of air conditioners due to the warmer weather in many countries. 
•Looking ahead, export quantities would continue to recover in tandem 
with trading partners’ growth although spillover benefits might be limited 
because trading partners’ growth is primarily driven by the services sector, 
and China has shifted to rely more on its domestic production capabilities. 
Exports are expected to recover more strongly in the latter half of 2023 
driven by a pickup in electronics exports in line with exports of other Asian 
economies, with the momentum being carried forth to 2024. 
•Export prices would remain high in line with prices of energy and other 
goods. 
•Export outlook is subject to downside risks from trading partners’ growth and 
potentially sharper -than-expected decline in Asian exports.

(1)Demand -pull inflationary pressures had been limited in 2022 due 
to a slower economic recovery than other countries. In contrast, advanced 
economies (AEs) returned to pre -COVID levels sooner than emerging Asia (EM 
Asia) (Chart 2) partly due to much larger fiscal stimulus packages implemented 
in AEs. Inflation has accelerated in many countries around the world, especially in 
the second half of 2021, rising from an average of 2.2% (an average between 2015 -
2021) to 8.3% in 2022. For Thailand, inflation increased from 1.2% in 2021 to 7.9% in 
August 2022, the highest level seen in 15 years. This significant increase in inflation was 
mainly attributed to global supply factors namely supply disruptions and the Russia -
Ukraine conflict which affected oil prices. As such, when these global supply factors 
gradually dissipated towards the end of 2022, inflation in many countries gradually 
declined.   
Nevertheless, each country’s disinflation process differs in terms of size and 
speed. As a country group (Chart 1), Asia’s disinflation process appeared faster than other 
groups, especially compared to western European and African countries. Moreover, inflation in 
Asia did not remain elevated like in other groups such as Latin America (LATAM). Thailand’s 
disinflation process poses unique developments as inflation, which peaked in mid -2022, 
sharply declined and returned to the target range of 1 -3% within just 7 months . 
While high inflation around the world was driven primarily by external factors, 
differences in disinflation process are due to specific factors commonly shared among 
each country group. Factors that kept inflation in Asia at low levels and help bringing it down 
faster than other countries include the followings : Box 1:Thailand’s disinflation process in the Asian context

Box 1:Thailand’s disinflation process in the Asian context
While a strong rebound in demand would result in sharp and broad -based 
increases in prices of goods and services and would keep inflation high in line with the 
recovery in household purchasing power and economic activities, it also allows 
businesses to pass on the higher costs to consumers1/. On the contrary, inflation in 
Asia was driven primarily by supply -side factors, which typically affect a handful 
of goods such as energy and raw food, rising inflation could thus turn around 
rather quickly through market mechanisms.
(2)Government energy subsidies in Asia have helped alleviate inflationary 
pressures and prevent the second -round effects. While increases in global energy 
prices were major drivers of inflation in Asia, energy inflation in Asia was low compared to 
other regions (Chart 3). This was due to government energy subsidies to provide living costs 
relief for households2/including price subsidies and reduction in excise tax on fuel and LPG, 
and electricity bill subsidies. These measures help facilitate a gradual increase in energy 
prices, which make up a large share of business operating costs, thus slowing down the cost 
pass-through and allowing businesses to effectively manage their overall costs. 
Note:1/Demand -driven inflation presents an important challenge for central banks in using 
monetary policy to fight against inflation. In the US, for instance, the Fed has raised the federal 
funds rate by a total to 500 bps since Q1/202. However, inflation only saw a limited decline, 
decreasing from 8.0% to 5.8% at present. 
2/These measures include fuel or LPG price subsidies in South Korea, Malaysia, and 
Thailand; Excise tax reduction on fuel and LPG in Japan, South Korea, and Thailand; and electricity 
bill subsidies in Thailand and Taiwan.

4/BIS (2023) “How sticky is current inflation?”, BIS Note for EME Governors Meeting on 11 May 2023 noted that 
shares of informal workers in India, Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam are higher than 50%. Thailand and 
Singapore have additional supply of immigrant workers that are permitted to work in the country. 
5/  Such as total working hours, wages, and benefitsIn addition, these government measures that help prevent sharp increases in energy 
prices also reduce the need for businesses to set high prices to cover the risk of a sharp rise 
in input costs. The latter would otherwise result in high costs of living and potentially trigger 
a second -round effect of a broad -based increase in prices of goods and services.
(3) Labor market conditions and structures in Asian countries did not add to 
the inflationary pressures and helped reduce risks of wage -price spiral. In mid -2022, 
wages in EM Asia increased by only 8%, which was much lower than those seen in 
Europe and LATAM whose wages increased by as much as 13% and 18%, respectively. 
Our study found that wage -price sensitivity in Asia is much lower than other 
regions. In the case of Thailand, a 1% increase in wages would result in just a 
0.04% increase in inflation3/. The limited wage increases seen in Asia can be 
attributed to 3 structural factors in the labor market namely (1) a flexible labor 
supply where there can be additional supply of labor from informal workers and 
immigrant workers4/; (2) the low wage bargaining power and smaller number of labor 
unions compared to AEs as reflected by Asia’s collective bargaining coverage rate5/at 
less than 25%, whereas the coverage rates in most AEs appear greater than 60%. 
Meanwhile, the share of employees that are members of the labor unions to total 
employees in most Asian countries accounts only around 3 -12% compared to 15 -30% in 
AEs; and (3) Asian countries do not have an automatic wage indexation like in some US 
states or some European countries.

Box 1:Thailand’s disinflation process in the Asian context
(4) Exchange rate passthrough (ERPT) to inflation in Asia is low. In 2022, most 
currencies experienced a sharp depreciation due to monetary policy normalization in 
the US. Asian currencies depreciated by an average of 9%. However, this had a limited 
impact on inflation due to the low ERPT. One study found that ERPT in Asia is lower 
than other regions6/. In Thailand’s case, the baht depreciation of 1% against the US 
dollar would result in only a 0.06% increase in price level7/.
Inflation in Asia has declined faster than other regions, but remains above 
levels seen in the past and could still be persistent. Looking ahead, it would be 
necessary to monitor (1) demand pressures in Asia that could mount due to a strong 
and robust economic recovery supported by a recovery in the services sector. This is 
especially the case for Thailand, which relies heavily on tourism; and (2) supply -side 
pressures from oil and commodity prices that could re -emerge if geopolitical tensions 
escalate. Agricultural and food prices could also increase due to the effects of El Niño 
from mid -2023 onwards. These present upside risks to inflation, especially for countries 
where food makes up a large share in the CPI basket such as Vietnam, the Philippines, 
and Thailand (more than 30% in the CPI basket ).
In this regard, even as inflation is declining, central banks still need to closely
monitor risks that could result in high and persistent inflation so that monetary 
policy could respond in a timely and appropriate manner. Note: 6/BIS(2019)“Monetary policy frameworks inEMEs: inflation targeting,the exchange rate and financial stability”,

28/53The Thai economy
•Trading partners’ growth for 2022 is revised up on account of better -than-expected outturns in 
the US, euro area, and China; a continued global economic recovery supported by growth in 
the services sector; and a recovery in investment and the real estate sector in China. The 
forecast for 2024 is revised down slightly due to the high base effect, tighter financial 
conditions, and potentially slower recovery in Asian exports.
•The federal funds rate is revised down throughout the forecast period on account of 
tighter financial conditions and the gradual decline in inflation. 
•Regional currencies (excluding the Chinese yuan) would appreciate due to the recovery 
in the services sector and tourism, and export recovery in the latter half of 2023. 
•Dubai crude oil prices would be unchanged throughout the forecast period. Concerns over the 
global economic slowdown could put downward pressure on crude oil prices. However, crude 
oil supply is likely to tighten due to additional production cuts by the OPEC+ which will take 
effect in May as well as recovery in demand from China in the latter half of the year.
•Farm income (excluding government support measures) in 2023 would see a smaller 
contraction due to higher prices, especially of palm oil, rice, and tapioca. Farm income in 
2024 would also see a smaller contraction as prices are expected to rise in tandem with 
demand for agricultural products. 
•Public spending at current prices for 2023 is revised down on account of lower -than-expected
budget disbursements for public investment spending. The forecast for 2024 is also revised 
down on account of potential delays in disbursements for transportation infrastructure 
investment projects of state -owned enterprises.

Assumptions for Dubai crude oil prices are unchanged . Prices are expected to fall in the near term due to concerns 
over the global economic outlook, but crude oil supply might tighten due to production cuts by the OPEC+. 
Dubai crude oil prices forecasts are unchanged throughout the forecast 
period.
•Crude oil prices would decline in the near term as concerns over a slowdown 
in the global economy could result in lower demand for oil. 
•Looking ahead, supply of crude oil could tighten due to additional production 
cuts by the OPEC+ which will take effect in May as well as a recovery in demand 
from China in Q3/2023. These factors would result in tighter oil market conditions 
and thus higher oil prices.  
Risks to the outlook for Dubai crude oil prices are now balanced.
•Upside risks: The Russia -Ukraine conflict could escalate, broaden, and prolonged;
and the gradual accumulation of crude oil to build up the US strategic 
petroleum reserve (SPR)
•Downside risks: Slower -than-expected global economic recovery.

Financial conditions: Key Issues
The baht’s movements have been 
volatile due to the Fed’s monetary 
policy direction, concerns pertaining to 
banking stresses abroad, and domestic 
political uncertainties.Overall financial conditions have turned 
less accommodative in line with the 
monetary policy stance. Borrowing costs 
have increased somewhat and private 
credit growth slowed down. However, 
overall financial conditions remain 
supportive of fund mobilization. Private credit has continued to expand. 
Business loans slowed down mainly 
owing to debt repayments, 
while some large corporates issued 
more corporate bonds. 
31/53Financial conditions
Financial conditions tightened slightly from the previous month:
•Funding costs increased slightly in line with the policy rate, but 
commercial banks’ lending rates and bond yields are still below 
levels seen in the past. 
•Private credit expanded but at a slower pace due to (1) debt 
repayments by large corporates; (2) the shift of large corporates’ 
financing toward corporate bond issuances; and ( 3) SME credit 
contraction due to repayments on maturing soft loans. Meanwhile , 
commercial banks remain cautious in lending to certain groups 
of SMEs. However, overall private credit still expanded in line 
with the economic recovery. 
•Exchange rate (FX) appreciated as reflected in the stronger 
average baht -to-US dollar exchange rate and the NEER in May 
from the same period last year. The appreciation was in line with 
improving current account balance and the Fed’s monetary 
policy direction.
•Global financial market volatility gradually subsided in line with 
concerns over banking stresses in AEs. Nonetheless, the market 
remains watchful of risks related to the US debt ceiling. Overall financial conditions have turned less accommodative in line with the monetary policy stance, 
but remain supportive of fund mobilization

Lending rates and deposit rates offered by commercial banks have gradually increased, but remain below levels seen in the past. Since the MPC’s decision to 
raise the policy rate to 2.00% on 31 May 2023, commercial banks have started to transmit the higher financing costs to the minimum retail rate (MRR) but ata lesser 
degree than the minimum loan rate (MLR). This is to soften the impact on vulnerable borrowers, most of whom are subject to th e MRR. Meanwhile, deposit rates, 
especially fixed deposits, are gradually increasing (Box2:Monetary policy transmission to commercial banks’ interest rates) .New Loan Rates (NLR) as of April 2023 
increased slightly from the previous month in line with reference lending rates but is still below levels seen in the past. The increase in NLR wasobserved in loan 
contracts smaller than 100 million baht in retail and manufacturing sectors, and loan contracts larger than 500 million baht in the manufacturing sector. Commercial banks’ lending rates increased slightly in line with the policy rate, but remain below levels seen in the past

Short-term government bond yields increased in line with the policy rate. Meanwhile, long-term government bond yields saw a slight increase partly influenced 
by higher US Treasury yields which were driven by: (1) the Fed’s monetary policy normalization; (2) banking stresses in the US and Europe; and (3) uncerta inties 
pertaining to the US debt ceiling. However, there was still demand for long -term government bonds from domestic investors while credit spreads remain relatively 
stable. As such, Thai bond yields did not see a significant increase and thus private sector financing costs in the bond market were largely unaffected . Financing costs in the bond market remain largely stable. Short -term government bond yields increased in line with

In Q1/2023, large corporate loan growth (credit limit >500 million baht) slowed down 
mainly due to debt repayments, especially in the services and manufacturing sectors. Loans 
extended to manufacturing businesses have continued to contract in line with the slowdown 
in exports due to slowing demand from trading partners. Nonetheless, borrowings by holding 
companies and retail businesses remained positive. Some large corporates have also 
shifted to issuing bonds with corporate bond issuances having seen a continued expansion 
since end -2022 and reaching a 3 -year high. 
SME loan growth (credit limit ≤500 million baht) contracted from the same period last 
year. This was mainly due to repayments on maturing soft loans. 
Household credit growth increased slightly especially mortgages and personal loans. 
This was in line with improving consumer confidence as the economy continues to 
recover and partly due to demand for liquidity to cope with higher living costs. 
Nonetheless, auto loan growth slowed down after having accelerated in the previous 
quarter to lock in costs for car purchases during the interest rate upcycle. Meanwhile, 
credit card loans continued to expand1/.
For Q2/20232/, loan demand would continue to grow with the economic recovery for 
inventory build -up and investment in machinery and equipment. However, the rising 
borrowing costs in line with the policy rate could result in some slowdown in business 
loan demand going forward. Meanwhile, household credit would continue to grow with 
increasing consumption spending needs and improving consumer confidence.

Appreciation
In Q2/2023, the baht averaged 34.40 per U.S. dollar (an average from 1 Apr to 6 June 2023), depreciating 1.42% from the average value in the previous quarter. 
The baht’s movement was driven by market expectations about the Fed’s monetary policy, the Chinese yuan depreciation, and pol itical uncertainties in Thailand. 
The nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) averaged 117.51, largely unchanged from the previous quarter. This was because the baht’s movement was in line 
with trading partners’ and competitors’ currencies. There have been net capital outflows from both bond and equity markets in Q2/2023. Capital outflows have 
continued from the previous quarter due to deteriorating global market sentiment and political uncertainties in Thailand. The baht depreciated slightly from the previous quarter driven by both external and Thailand -specific factors

Box 2:Monetary policy transmission to commercial banks’ interest rates
37/53On 31 May 2023, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to raise the 
policy rate to 2.00%. This was the 6thpolicy rate hike since August 2022 after having 
kept the policy rate at the historical low for more than 2 years since the onset of the 
COVID -19 pandemic. Policy rate adjustments affect commercial bank’s interest 
rates, which is an important channel of monetary policy transmission for bank -
based economy.
A study on how commercial banks adjust their interest rates during the 
tightening cycles suggests that monetary policy transmission to commercial banks’
interest rates in this current cycle differs from the previous cycles in various 
dimensions:
Overall (1)Commercial banks adjust each type of lending rates differently 
from the past. In this current cycle, the increase in the minimum lending rate (MLR) 
appeared faster and larger than the minimum retail rate (MRR). (Chart 1) This is 
different from the past where the adjustments were similar among different interest 
rate types. This changing behavior partly helps to alleviate the impact on debt burden 
for vulnerable SMEs and households, most of whom are subject to the MRR, especially as 
some financial assistance measures would gradually expire this year. Moreover, a 
gradual increase in the MRR during the time when income is gradually recovering 
would also improve debt serviceability.Note:1) Passthrough is calculated from changes in each type of interest rates to changes in policy rate. 
3 tightening cycles include Q3/2004 -Q4/2006, Q3/2010 -Q3/2011, and Q3/2022 -Q2/2023.
2) Passthrough to lending rates excludes the effect of temporary FIDF fee reduction that expired 
during the current tightening cycle; Passthrough to fixed deposits is calculated from the average 
passthroughs to 3 -month, 6 -month, 12 -month, and 24 -month fixed deposit rates.
3) Minimum overdraft rate (MOR) refers to the lending rate charged on overdrafts.

Box 2:Monetary policy transmission to commercial banks’ interest rates
38/53(2)Commercial banks did not raise deposit rates as much as they did in the past , 
especially saving deposits. This is partly due to abundant liquidity in the banking system. 
Deposits of households and businesses was growing at 3%, close to pre -pandemic levels. 
The loan -to-deposit ratio (L/D ratio) is 90.6 as of March 2023, which is at its lowest since 
2016, reflecting that commercial banks still have capacity to lend.
The commercial bank dimension: Different commercial banks adjust their 
lending and deposit rates differently in this current tightening cycle. The changing 
behavior can be categorized into 2 groups: large commercial banks, and other
banks1/(Chart 2). For lending rates, (1) large commercial banks transmit the higher 
financing costs to MLR more than other banks (76% vs. 59%), and to MRR less than other 
banks (47% vs. 49%); and (2) large commercial banks tend to raise the MLR soon after the 
policy rate hike, while gradually raising the MRR later. Meanwhile, other banks would 
frontload both MLR and MRR increases at the onset of the policy rate hike. For deposit 
rates, (1) large commercial banks raise their deposit rates more than other banks, especially 
for fixed deposits; and (2) large commercial banks would frontload deposit rate increases at 
the onset of the policy rate hike before eventually tapering down, while other banks would 
raise deposit rates gradually throughout.
The changing behaviors of the interest rate passthrough as outlined above 
can be attributed to many factors namely (1) different funding structure of each 
commercial bank (Chart 3). Large commercial banks account 87% of total loan 
outstanding of commercial banks in Thailand, over half of which are subject to the MLR
and borrowers are mostly large corporates who are able to service their debts. As such, 
large commercial banks were able to transmit the higher financing costs more quickly toNote: Interest rate passthrough is weighted by loan and deposit outstanding of each commercial bank

this group and at a more gradual pace to their retail borrowers through the MRR. Large 
commercial banks also account 88% of total deposit outstanding of commercial banks in 
Thailand, relying more on saving deposits ( 76% of total deposits) than fixed deposits ( 24% of total 
deposits). So far, large commercial banks have raised fixed -deposit rates more than saving rates, 
especially for 12-month and 24-month fixed deposits. This partly helps to manage their costs 
during an interest rate upcycle. As a result, households have begun to shift their saving balances 
towards fixed deposits since Q 4/2022; and (2) lending and deposit rates offered by other 
banks were already higher than those being offered by large commercial banks. Lending 
rates offered by other banks were on average 1% higher than those being offered by large 
commercial banks. As such, other banks did not raise their lending rates much in order to 
remain competitive. At the same time, other banks would raise fixed -deposit rates by a smaller 
extent because deposit rates being offered were already higher, while they also rely more on 
fixed deposits with share of fixed deposits almost doubles that of large commercial banks. 
In summary, monetary policy transmission remains effective overall. The changing 
behaviors of the interest rate passthrough such that commercial banks being more 
careful with interest rate adjustments affecting the vulnerable groups are in line with the 
gradual and measured approach of the monetary policy normalization that aims to 
support the sustainable economic recovery. Meanwhile, the Bank of Thailand would continue 
to emphasize the importance of financial measures while working together with all 
stakeholders to find sustainable solutions to assist the vulnerable groups.

Core inflation will play a larger role going forward. Upside risks remain from demand pressures amid economic 
expansion, higher cost pass -through, and more frequent price adjustments driven by rising supply pressures.
Persistently high inflation could have 
implications for price -setting behavior and 
inflation expectationsKey factors to be monitored
Cost pass -through and demand pressures could 
increase due to stronger -than-expected 
economic recovery
Supply -side pressures could rise in part contingent

The MPC expect sthe Thai economy to continue expanding but upside risks to 
inflation must be monitored closely. The MPC judges that it is appropriate to 
raise the policy interest rate in a gradual and measured manner toward 
a level consistent with long -term sustainable growth, and is prepared to adjust 
to size and timing of policy normalization should the evolving growth and 
inflation outlook differ from the current assessment.Financial stability remains sound overall. Debt serviceability of businesses and 
households has improved with the economic recovery. However, financial 
positions of some SMEs and households remain vulnerable and sensitive to 
higher living costs and debt burden. Hence, the continued implementation of 
debt restructuring measures is still necessary. The Thai economy should continue to expand, driven mainly by tourism and 
private consumption, while merchandise exports are expected to recover 
gradually. Headline inflation returned to the target range, while core inflation 
is expected to remain elevated. The inflation outlook is subject to upside risks
