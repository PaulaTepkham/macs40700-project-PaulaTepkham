Executive Summary
Monetary Policy Conduct
in the Third Quarter of 2021Assessment of the Economic and Financial Outlook as the Basis for Policy Formulation
7At the meeting on August 4, 2021, the Committee decided
to maintain the policy rate at 0.50 percent. The votes 
were not unanimous with two members viewing that a 
policy rate cut would preempt potential economic slowdown
in the period ahead given that the Thai economy could
be impacted by the COVID -19 outbreak to a greater 
extent than previously assessed and remained subject 
to significant downside risks.  
At the meeting on September 29, 2021, the Committee 
voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 0.50 
percent. The Committee viewed that progress on vaccination
and earlier -than-expected relaxation of containment 
measures would help support the economy. The Thai 
economy was projected to expand 0.7 and 3.9 percent in 
2021 and 2022, respectively, largely unchanged from the 
August projection. Nevertheless, the economic outlook remained
highly uncertain.   
The Committee viewed that the most important issue for 
the Thai economy at present was the implementation of 
public health measures in a way that would facilitate 
the recovery in economic activities and income. The 
Committee also viewed that there was further progress 
on financial measures which would be more effective in 
providing tar geted liquidity support and reducing debt 
burden than a further reduction in the policy rate which 
was already low. 1. Global Economy
•Trading partner economies in2021 would register slower growth than theprevious assessment duetothenewwave oftheoutbreak ofCOVID -19
Delta variant thatbecame widespread andhadaffected recovery inconsumption, production, andexports .Theslowdown wasalsoattributable tothe
ongoing supply disruption which wasmore prolonged thanexpected .
•Growth among trading partner economies was expected to rebound in 2022 as the outbreak would subside and vaccination targets would be achieved.  
•Most central banks would continue tomaintain accommodative monetary policy stances tosupport economic recovery, while some central banks would
raisetheirpolicy interest rates inresponse toreflation risks.
2. Financial Conditions and Financial Stability
•Overall financial conditions inThailand remained accommodative andhelped financial institutions tocontinue assisting borrowers through various
financial measures .Onexchange rates, thebaht against theU.S.dollar andtheeffective exchange ratecontinued todepreciate from theprevious
quarter .Thedepreciation wasdueto(1)thethird wave ofCOVID -19outbreak inThailand, (2)theannouncement oflarger -than-expected Thaigovernment
bond issuance under thefiscal year2022,and(3)theappreciation oftheU.S.dollar aftertheFederal Reserve signaled atapering ofitsasset purchases .
•TheThai financial system remained vulnerable, especially asbalance sheets ofhouseholds andbusinesses were affected bythethird wave of
COVID -19outbreak inThailand .Thisresulted inaslower andmore uncertain economic recovery .Businesses that provide tourism -related services ,
inparticular, remained weak andcontinued tobeimpacted bythelatest round ofcontainment measures .
3. Economic and Inflation Outlook 
•The Thai economy was projected to register slower growth of 0.7 percent in 2021 due to the more prolonged and severe third wa ve of COVID -19 
outbreak that affected domestic spending and foreign tourist figures. In 2022, the Thai economy was projected to grow 3.9 percent aseconomic activities 
would gradually recover and more foreign tourists were permitted to enter Thailand. 
•Headline inflation was projected to be 1.0 percent in 2021 and 1.4 percent in 2022. For 2021, headline inflation was revised down from the previous 
assessment due to the year -on-year decline in fresh food prices in tandem with higher -than-expected outputs, as well as measures to help lower the cost of 
living. For 2022, headline inflation was revised up due to the lower base effect. Headline inflation would remain within the target range throughout the 
forecast horizon. 2. Global Economy

Global economy: Summary of Key Issues
The global economy would 
continue to recover
despite some slowdown due to
the spread of virus mutations 
and the ongoing supply disruptionsInflation has picked up 
in many countries
mainly due to supply -side factors. 
Inflation expectations remained 
largely unchanged.Trading partners economies 
was expected to register slower 
growth in 2021 compared to 
the previous assessment
due to the outbreak of virus 
mutations that intensifiedMonetary policy stances 
remained accommodative
although some central banks 
in major advanced economies  
started to signal possible policy 
normalization
9
The total number COVID -19 cases worldwide have increased, especially among emerging economies
where the progress on vaccinations remained slow overall
The outbreak of virus mutations was prolonged and became more widespread . 
The number of new COVID -19 cases in many countries has continued to rise 
since the second quarter of 2021. However, the severity of the outbreak 
varied across countries depending mainly on the vaccination rates in 
that respective country. 
Major advanced economies (AE)with high vaccination rates such as the U.S., 
the euro area, Japan, and the United Kingdoms were able to ease lockdowns
even as the number of new cases continued to rise. Meanwhile, emerging 
economies (EM)with low vaccination rates, especially Asian economies like 
Indonesia and the Philippines, still maintain strict containment measures. Global Economy

Private consumption in many countries would likely slow down due to stricter containment measures. 
Consumption in Asian economies was impacted by the tightening of 
containment measures in the third quarter of 2021.
•China imposed the strictest containment measures in 20 provinces.
Some seaports were also closed or faced tighter restrictions between 
July and August 2021. 
•Vietnam implemented containment measures in July 2021 which was 
further extended until mid -September 2021 
•Australia implemented containment measures towards the end of June 
2021. The measures were later expanded to cover more areas and were 
extended to remain in effect until October 2021. 
In the short run, the recovery in consumption among Asian economies would 
be held back by containment measures. Nevertheless, it was assessed that 
consumption would gradually recover in the fourth quarter of 2021 given 
that the outbreak situation would likely improve with higher vaccination rates.Global Economy

13Manufacturing and exports were expected to slow down due to prolonged supply disruption
Manufacturing and exports in some countries would slow down due to 
prolonged supply disruption such as reduced working hours after containment
measures were tightened, the closure of seaports in China, the shortage of 
freight containers, and the shortage of manufacturing inputs such as electronic 
parts. However, the supply disruption was expected to be resolved within 
the first half of 2022 as economic activities gradually return to normal in 
many countries.

on consumption and manufacturing . The U.S. economy was affected by 
the outbreak of the delta variant that became more widespread. Meanwhile, 
Japan, China, and many other Asian economies were also further affected 
by the implementation of stricter containment measures which impacted 
private consumption and the manufacturing sector, prolonging the ongoing 
supply disruption. On the other hand, the outlook for the euro area has 
improved given ( 1) the relaxation of containment measures and high 
vaccination rates , and (2) the disbursements under the Next Generation EU 
Fund which would help drive growth going forward.
Trading partners ’ growth forecasts for 2022 were revised up under the 
assumptions that the outbreak would subside and vaccination targets 
could be achieved. These factors would support a gradual resumption in 
economic activities in many countries.

The Thai Economy
The Thai Economy: Summary of Key Issues
The Thai economy would slow 
down significantly in the third 
quarter of 2021. However, 
progress on vaccination allowed 
the government to gradually relax 
containment measures since 
September 1, 2021. This would 
help support the economic 
recovery going forward. Although the recovery outlook 
had improved, uncertainties 
remained high. Risk factors that 
warrant monitoring include 
(1) implementation and relaxation 
of domestic containment measures, 
(2) continuity of government 
stimulus, and ( 3) external factors. The Thai economy would 
register slower growth in 2021, 
compared with the June 
assessment due to more severe 
outbreak of COVID -19 
from virus mutations.   Headline and core inflation 
remained low in line with weak 
domestic demand. 
Inflation expectations remained 
anchored within the target range.

severe and widespread in the beginning of the

the number of new cases also outpaced the 
number of recoveries, causing the cumulative numbe r 
of COVID -19 patients to exceed the capacity of 
the public health system.
The outbreak situation had improved since 
the end of August 2021 in line with increased 
vaccination rates. This allowed the government 
to gradually relax containment measures. However,

reflected in the continuously rising number 
of employees under the social security 
system who applied for unemployment 
benefits due to unforeseen circumstances, 
especially workers in the service sector. 
Laid-off workers in the service sector were

At the end of the second quarter of 2021, the ratio of household debt to GDP remained high at 89.3percent despite declining from the previous quarter. The decline was mainly attributed to higher 
nominal GDP growth while growth of household debt remained largely unchanged. The increase in household debt would further we ighon recovery in consumption and the economic growth in the period ahead.

Households were also subject to risks pertaining to the economic recovery which remained highly uncertain as a result of the COVID -19 outbreak. Thus, it is necessary to closely monitor debt servicing

Financial positions of businesses became more fragile in the second quarter of 2021. This was reflected in their lower operating profit margin (OPM) and interest 
coverage ratio (ICR). It was deemed necessary to closely monitor debt servicing capability of businesses that were significan tlyaffected by the latest containment measures, 
namely tourism -related services and construction, especially small and medium -sized enterprises (SMEs). Given high uncertainties surrounding the COVID -19 outbreak , 
the BOT has adjusted its soft loan scheme to enhance credit access for SMEs. Click for more details on adjustment to the soft loan scheme.

ToleranceTrade -off frontier between economic growth and public health safety
The decision to implement public health measures depends on the trade -offs
between social costs, as measured by the number of severe cases which 
could become fatal, and economic costs. Limited vaccine supply in the first 
half of 2021 led to an implementation of strict containment measures in the 
third quarter of 2021.
Nevertheless, distribution of vaccines to high -risk groups at the beginning of 
September 2021 helped contain the outbreak by reducing the number of 
severe cases. The Center for COVID -19 Situation Administration (CCSA) was 
thus able to relax the containment measures since September 1, 2021. 
This led to a resumption in economic activities which would support the 
economic recovery going forward. 
While the situation has improved recently, the COVID -19 outbreak would 
likely be prolonged due to virus mutation. Greater emphasis should be placed
on monitoring the number of severe cases and vaccination rates in addition to 
the number of new cases.
Looking forward, containment measures would likely be further relaxed. 
The number of new cases could rise as restrictions are eased. However, vaccination 
progress would help reduce the number of severe cases.Developments in the COVID -19 outbreak and vaccination progress

Headline inflation would remain lowintandem withweak demand -pullinflationary pressures .Medium -term inflation
expectations remained well-anchored within thetarget range .
Headline inflation in the first two months of the third quarter of 2021 averaged 0.22 percent, falling from 2.36 
percent in the previous quarter. The decline was due to the dissipation of the base effect of low energy prices in the 
previous year, as well as the government’s electricity bill subsidies to lower the cost of living in July and August 2021. 
There was also a larger contraction in fresh food prices compared with the previous quarter mainly due to prices of 
vegetables and fruits. 
Core inflation in the first two months of the third quarter of 2021 averaged 0.11 percent, falling from 0.43 percent 
in the previous quarter. The decline was mainly attributed to lower prices of housing and furnishing due to the 
government’s water bill subsidies to reduce the cost of living during the COVID -19 outbreak. Short-term and medium -term inflation expectations remained within the target range 
•The short -term (one -year ahead) inflation expectation according to the survey of businesses
in August 2021 was 1.7 percent.

deficit of 15.3 billion U.S. dollars in 2021 due to a 
sharp rise in shipping costs as well as a smaller trade 
surplus on account of increased imports and lower 
exports from domestic and global supply disruption. 
Current account balance was projected to register 
a surplus of 1.0 billion U.S. dollars in 2022 . This downward
revision from the previous assessment was attributed 
to higher -than-expected shipping costs, lower tourism 
receipts in line with lower foreign tourist figures, and a 
smaller trade surplus from a slowdown in external 
demand and increased imports. Summary of changes in current account forecast Container shipping cost
The Thai EconomyEconomic forecast: The Committee assessed that the Thai economy would grow 0.7 percent in 2021 and 3.9 percent in 2022. 
Merchandise exports would expand at a slightly slower pace throughout the forecast period due to both domestic and global supply disruption. 
Value of merchandise exports was expected to grow 16.5 percent in 2021 and 3.7 percent in 2022, slightly slower compared with the previous forecast. The 
downward revision was attributed primarily to lower export volumes given the temporary impacts of the more severe COVID -19 outbreak on Thai manufacturing 
sector in the third quarter of 2021. Some factories had to close or reduce manufacturing output temporarily in accordance with the containment measures as well as
migrant labor shortages. The export outlook was expected to be affected by shortages of containers and semiconductors which w ould likely last until mid -2022. 
Exports of services would continue to contract and recover more slowly than previously assessed. The tourism sector would recover more slowly than 
previously expected due to more severe COVID -19 outbreaks both in Thailand and abroad. This could delay the unconditional re -opening of Thailand's 
borders and commercial flights to foreign tourists and China would likely postpone the re -opening of its borders to 2023. Theref ore, the projected foreign 
tourist figures were revised down to 150,000 persons in 2021 and 6 million persons in 2022 . 
Private consumption in 2021 was significantly affected by the spread of Delta variant which became more severe to the point that the government had 
to impose strict containment measures in the third quarter of 2021. Thus, private consumption growth in 2021 was revised down from 2.5 percent to 0.0 
percent. Nonetheless, better -than-expected vaccination progress, the relaxation of containment measures since the beginning of S eptember 2021, and various 
relief measures and fiscal stimulus measures would foster confidence, help boost consumption in the fourth quarter of 2021, a nd support consumption 
recovery in 2022 . 
Private investment in 2021 would expand at a lower rate than previously assessed. The spread of Delta variant resulted in weakened demand and 
business confidence. Investment in the construction sector was also impacted by strict containment measures in certain constr uction sites. As a result, private 
investment forecast for 2021 was revised down to 4.2 percent. However, private investment would continue to expand from end -2021 to 2022 as private 
consumption gradually picks up .

The Thai EconomyHeadline inflation would were additionally impacted by the higher -than-expected
impact of government measures and supply -side factors. 
•Core inflation would be largely unchanged from the previous projection 
and stay low in tandem with weakened recovery.
•The energy and fuel inflation would rise slightly in the short run owing 
to rising global crude oil prices, although this would be partially offset by the 
impacts of an extension of the government’s electricity bill subsidy measure. 
However, crude oil prices would decline to the level that was previously 
expected. Thus, the forecast for 2022 was largely unchanged.
•Fresh food inflation would decline in 2021 in line with the lower -than-
expected vegetable and fruit prices, as well as the lower rice prices from 
domestic oversupply. This was attributed to high shipping costs that caused 
difficulties to drain the excess stock and favorable weather conditions, resulting
in increased agricultural outputs. Such problems were expected to gradually 
subside in 2022, thus causing an increase in fresh food inflation from the 
lower base effect .%YoY 2020* 2021 2022

2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023Summary of key forecast assumptions
•Trading partner economies would slow down in 2021 due to the prolonged outbreak of 
COVID -19 Delta variant in many countries and the ongoing supply disruption exacerbated by 
more stringent containment measures imposed as the outbreak became more severe. 
However, many countries have achieved their vaccination targets. Thus, growth among 
trading partner economies would pick up in 2022. 
•The Federal Funds Rate assumption was unchanged at 0.00 -0.25percent
•Regional currencies (excluding the Chinese yuan) would weaken slightly due to 
an increased possibility of QE tapering by the Federal Reserve and the more severe 
outbreak of COVID -19 Delta variant among ASEAN countries. 
•Dubai crude oil prices were revised up due to a temporary decline in supply in the 
second half of 2021 from a delay in OPEC+ negotiations to increase oil production 
and the impacts of Hurricane Ida on U.S. oil output. Looking ahead, the oil market 
would become less tight, and oil prices would return to normal in 2022.
•Farm income (excluding government support measures) was revised down for 
2021 on account of lower rice prices owing to domestic oversupply. Rice exporters have
faced logistical issues, resulting in a large stockpile of rice domestically . Off-season 
rice production was also higher than expected due to favorable weather conditions. 
The situation was expected to gradually improve in 2022, and farm income would 
expand at about the same rate as previously assessed.
•Public spending at current price was revised down. Government consumption was revised
down due to lower -than-expected budget disbursements in the second quarter of 2021. 
Public investment was revised down because of the shift in investment expenditures 
under the Emergency Decree to public health expenditures.
•Additional assumptions that underpin the latest recovery prospects include 
(1)Current containment measures are sufficient to reduce the number of severe cases to be within the 
capacity of the public health system. Thus, there is no need to tighten the containment measures. 
(2)The government can procure and administer two COVID -19 vaccine doses to more than 80% of high -risk 
groups and more than 70% of general population by the end of 2021. This would allow the government 
to relax all containment measures within the first quarter of 2022. 
(3)Additional fiscal stimulus would be forthcoming under the new Emergency Decree that authorized 500 
billion baht of government borrowing. Annual percentage change 2020* 2021 2022

The outbreak trajectory would depend on ( 1) the transmission rate and severity of the 
casesand (2) intervention policyVirus mutations have led to more severe and widespread outbreaks in of 
new cases outpaced recoveries, resulting in a marked increase in cThailand 
during the earlier parts of the third quarter of 2021. The number umulative 
cases. Government policy thus focused on strict containment measures to 
reduce the number of COVID -19 patients and sustain capacity of the public 
health system given that vaccination was still progressing slowly at the time. 
The strict containment measures had significant impacts on economic 
activities, employment, and income.  
Going forward, the implementation of public health measures  to contain 
the outbreak should facilitate economic activities and income recovery. 
The policies should focus on long -term results, by prioritizing the procurement
of appropriate vaccines to be distributed in a broad -based and timely 
manner. Higher vaccination rates would reduce the number of severe hospitalization
even as the number of new cases continues to rise. This would reduce the 
need for stringent containment measures and thus allow economic activities 
to resume normalcy for both businesses and households.

Note: * according to CCSA Monetary Policy Decision
Monetary policy contributed toaccommodative financial conditions .Theoverall costs offinancing forbusinesses through
both banks andbond markets remained low.
Overall private sector financing costs through 
commercial banks and bond markets remained 
low. The minimum loan rate (MLR) of commercial 
banks remained below pre -COVID levels. The new 
loan rate (NLR) declined from the end of the second 
quarter of 2021, especially for loan contracts smaller 
than 100 million baht in the manufacturing and trade 
sectors. The decline in NLR was partly due to progress 
made with the soft loan facility.
The credit spread between corporate and government
bonds (corporate credit spread) with maturity of 
3 years or less was largely unchanged from the end 
of the second quarter of 2021 across all credit ratings . 
However, the corporate credit spread for BBB -rated bonds 
remained elevated. Overall, the private sector was 
still able to obtain financing through the bond market 
as normal. 0246810

Thebaht depreciated anddidnotimpede economic recovery .However, thebaht would remain highly volatile inthe
period ahead .
In July, the baht depreciated more sharply than other regional currencies due to capital outflows from the Thai bond market driven in part by concerns over the COVID -19 outbreak in 
Thailand. Towards the end of August, the baht appreciated due to capital inflows returning into the Thai stock market and short -term government bonds. This was in line with capital 
flows development in other regional markets as investors’ concerns have subsided after the Fed signaled a dovish tone at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium. However, in late 
September, the baht depreciated further. The depreciation was driven by capital outflows from the Thai bond market after the Ministry of Finance announced a larger -than-expected 
issuance of Thai government bonds under the Fiscal Year 2022 Budget, and the stronger U.S. dollar after the Fed signaled a ta pering of its asset purchases amidst improved U.S. economic 
outlook. Looking ahead, the baht exchange rate would remain highly volatile due to QE tapering by the Fed and thus must be monitored closely.Monetary Policy Decision

remained theneed tocontinue expediting additional measures thataremore effective andwell-targeted, namely thesoftloanfacility, theasset warehousin g
scheme, anddebt restructuring programs thatarewell-tailored tothelong-term debt repayment serviceability ofdifferent groups ofborrowers .
Large corporates were still able to obtain financing throughout 
the second quarter of 2021. Corporate bond issuance has increased , 
mostly to rollover existing debt. Bank lending to large corporates 
(credit limit over 500 million baht) slowed down somewhat due 
to a higher base in the previous year but was still expanding 
across many sectors in part due to liquidity needs during the third 
wave of COVID -19 outbreak. 
Bank lending to SMEs (credit limit less than 500 million baht) 
turned positive in the second quarter of 2021. This was in part 
supported by the soft loan facility which improved credit extension
to businesses in the trade and services sectors. Monetary Policy Decision

Monetary Policy DecisionFiscal measures should prioritize providing relief to affected groups and supporting economic recovery.
The government should also prepare measures to restore economic growth and uplift long -term growth potential.Monetary Policy Decision
Fiscal measures should prioritize providing relief to the affected groups and supporting the economy to better suit the current situation. Measures should aim at supporting 
employment and businesses that are most vulnerable in a sufficient and timely matter. The government should also prepare measures to restore economic growth and uplift long -term
growth potential going forward so that they could be implemented once the pandemic subsides. 
Raising the public debt ceiling to 70 percent of GDP and growing public debt levels do not pose significant risks to fiscal s ustainability because (1) Thailand’s public debt stood at 
57 percent in August 2021 which was still low compared to advanced economies and EM Asia at 120 percent and 70 percent, respe ctively; (2) large portion of Thailand’s public debt are 
domestic debt and have low financing costs; and (3) risks that Thailand’s credit rating would be downgraded are low. 
Public debt to GDP will eventually decline over the longer term if the budget were to be spent efficiently towards shoring up the economy that remained subject to high degrees of 
risks in the short -run and implementing structural reforms such as labor upskilling/reskilling. In addition, the government should have clear medium -term fiscal consolidation plans 
including generating additional government revenues by expanding tax bases and keeping current expenditures in check.

051015202530354045505560657075Special Issue 1: Impact of debt burden on household consumption
The study2/used data from the Household Socio -Economic Survey from 
2013, 2015, 2017, and 2019 (only households with debt are selected in the 
sample) to assess the correlation between consumption and debt service 
ratio (DSR) of households. The study found that debt burden was a factor 
that would drag household consumption in the period ahead. The 3 key 
findings were as follow
1)Prior to COVID -19, household debt levels in Thailand were elevated and 
the DSR in 2019 was close to 30% which was the turning point where 
debt burden would start to negatively impact consumption. 
2)The COVID -19 crisis impacted household income. It was estimated that 
the DSR increased from 28.6% in 2019 to 34% in 2021. Such increase in 
debt burden resulted in a 0.2% and 0.6% decline in household consumption
in 2020 and 2021, respectively. 
3)Income -support and debt restructuring measures were still needed to 
prevent debt burden from dragging household consumption to the point 
that it affects the overall economic recovery. Average consumption (baht per month)
