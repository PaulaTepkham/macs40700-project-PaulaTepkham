Monetary Policy Report  
 
 
The Monetary Policy Report  is prepared quarterly by staff of the 
Bank of Thailand with the approval of the Monetary Policy Committee 
(MPC ). It serves two purposes : (1) to communicate to the public the  
MPC ’s consideration and rationales for the conduct of monetary policy,  
and (2) to present the latest set of economic and inflation forecasts, based 
on which the monetary policy decisions were made .

Monetary Policy in Thailand  
Monetary Policy Committee  
Under the Bank of Thailand Act, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC ) comprises the governor 
and two deputy governors, as well as four distinguished external members representing various 
sectors of the economy, with the aim of ensuring  that monetary policy decisions are effective and 
transparent . 
Monetary Policy Objective   
The MPC implements monetary policy under the flexible inflation targeting regime . While regarding  
medium–term price stability as its primary objective, the MPC also aims at supporting sustainable, 
full-potential economic growth and preserving financial stability, attributing to long -term price stability  
and economic sustainability  
Monetary Policy Target  
On December  24, 2019, the Cabinet approved the monetary policy target for 2020, which was 
mutually agreed between the MPC and the Minister of Finance to set the headline inflation  within 
the range of 1 –3 percent as the target for the medium -term hor izon and for 2020 . 
In the event that average headline inflation in the past 12 months or a forecast of average headline 
inflation over 12 months ahead breaches the target range, the MPC shall  send an open letter to 
the Minister of Finance to explain  reason s for the breach of the target range,  together with 
measures taken and estimated time to bring inflation back to the target . In addition, the MPC will 
write an additional open letter to the Minister of Finance every six months if average headline 
inflation  based on the above criteria remains outside the target range . 
Monetary Policy Instrument  
The MPC utilizes the 1 -day bilateral repurchase transaction rate as the policy interest rate to signal 
the monetary policy stance . 
Evaluation of Economic Conditions and Forecasts  
The Bank of Thailand takes into account information from all sources, the macroeconomic model, 
data from each economic sector, as well as surveys  of large enterprises, together with  small and 
medium -sized enterprises from all over the country, and various financial institutions  to ensure that 
economic evaluations and forecasts are accurate and cover all aspects, both at the macro and 
micro levels . 
Monetary Policy Communication  
Recognizing the importance of monetary policy communication  to the public, the MPC employs  
various  channels of communication, both in Thai and English, such as (1) organizing a press 
statement at 14 :00 on the day of the Committee meeting, (2) publishing edited minutes of the MPC 
meeting two weeks after the meeting , and (3) publishing the Monetary Policy Report  every quarter

Monetary Policy Conduct in the Third Quarter of 2020  
At the meetings on August 5 and September 23, 2020, the Committee voted unanimously  
to maintain the policy rate at 0 .50 percent . The Thai economy was expected to gradually 
recover in line with the relaxation of COVID -19 containment measures in Thailand and abroad . 
However, the Thai economic recovery would take at least two years before returning to the 
pre-pandemic level and would be highly uncertain . Nonetheless, the Committee viewed that 
the extra accommodative monetary policy since the beginning of the year as well as fiscal, 
financial, and credit measures additionally announced helped alleviate adverse impacts, and 
would support  the economic recovery after the pandemic subsided . Moreover, a further 
decrease in the policy rate would be less effective in the current context and could increase 
vulnerabilities in the financial system . The limited policy space should therefore be pres erved 
for the appropriate and most effective timing . Also, the Committee deemed it necessary to 
encourage financial institutions to expedite debt restructuring for households and businesses 
to have a broader impact and accelerate lending under various meas ures to address liquidity 
problems in a targeted and timely manner consistent with business restructuring . 
Looking ahead, the Committee assessed that the Thai economic recovery would take 
at least two years before returning to the pre -pandemic level and wo uld face high 
uncertainties . Moreover, the recovery would be greatly uneven among economic 
sectors and firms in different segments . Government policies should therefore be 
implemented in a targeted and timely manner to facilitate appropriate adjustments, 
while policy coordination among government agencies would be crucial to ensure more 
coherent and consistent measures . Going forward, fiscal and supply -side policies should 
be given a greater role in order to address excess production capacity, as well as su pport the 
changing economic structure, patterns of business operations, and labor skill development 
consistent with the post -COVID environment . The continued accommodative monetary policy 
would complement fiscal policy through low costs of borrowing and am ple liquidity in the 
financial markets . In addition, the continuation of financial and credit measures, particularly 
debt restructuring, would help reduce vulnerabilities of households and businesses . 
Assessment of the Economic and Financial Outlook as the  Basis for Policy Formulation  
1. Global Economy  
The global economy was expected to contract this year  due to the severe impact of  
the COVID -19 pandemic on private consumption and investment, as well as manufacturing 
production and exports . As a result, many countries, especially major advanced economies, 
were expected to enter a recession this year . However, the gradual relaxation of containment 
measures and government stimulus measures introduced in many countries could lead to a 
faster -than-expected re covery of trading partner economies . The Committee thus revised 
up economic growth projections for Thailand ’s trading partners to a 4 .5 percent 
contraction  in 2020, followed by a 4 .4 percent expansion in 2021 . However, there 
remained risks that trading par tner economies would underperform the baseline 
projection due to several factors, but the likelihood that trading partners would re -
impose strict and nationwide containment measures declined . Trading partner economies   
Monetary Policy Report  September 2020                                                                                                                      6 could underperform the baseline projection due to a more severe and prolonged outbreak than 
previously assessed as a result of an emergence of the second wave of the outbreak, greater 
vulnerabilities in the global financial system, and re -intensifying trade tensions between the 
U.S. and China . On the other hand, trading partner economies could outperform the baseline 
projection should the pandemic end sooner than expected, or monetary and fiscal measures 
implemented worldwide turn out to be more effective than expected . 
Governments in var ious countries worldwide continued to implement monetary and 
fiscal measures to alleviate the economic impact of the COVID -19 pandemic . Governments  
continued to introduce series of relief measures aimed particularly at SMEs, households and 
employment . At the same time, central banks in major advanced economies continued to 
maintain accommodative monetary policy, including both quantitative easing and low policy 
interest rates . Meanwhile, some regional central banks eased monetary policy further . 
2. Financial Conditions and Financial Stability  
Overall financial conditions in Thailand remained accommodative . The real policy interest  
rate remained low compared with those in other emerging markets . Short -term interest rates 
in the financial markets stabi lized at low levels consistent with the policy rate . Meanwhile,  
long-term government bond yields increased slightly in tandem with the U .S. Treasury yields 
and also due to bond -switching activities which contributed to a larger supply of long -term 
governm ent bonds . Corporate credit spreads remained high, although the spreads of 
investment -grade bonds began to narrow somewhat . The minimum lending rates (MLR ) 
remained at low levels, while the new loan rates (NLR) for corporates gradually declined, 
consistent  with the accommodative monetary policy and as a result of soft loan programs . 
Corporate financing continued to expand, albeit at a slower pace as some businesses had 
already raised funds to increase liquidity in the previous period . With regard to exchange rates, 
the baht against the U .S. dollar and the effective exchange rate depreciated from the previous 
quarter, with high exchange rate volatilities during the third quarter in line with investors ’ risk 
sentiments . Nevertheless, the Co mmittee asses sed that if the baht were to appreciate rapidly, 
the economic recovery could be affected . Therefore, the Committee would closely monitor 
exchange rate developments in order to assess the necessity of implementing additional 
appropriate measures . 
The Thai f inancial system remained highly vulnerable due to this year ’s economic 
contraction caused by the COVID -19 pandemic . This led to more vulnerable financial 
positions of households and businesses and consequently increased risk of defaults . 
However, the imple mentation of proactive financial and credit measures, coupled with more 
targeted measures, such as the DR BIZ program and the debt consolidation program for retail 
borrowers, would help mitigate these risks . 
3. Economic and Inflation Outlook  
The Thai economy was projected to contract by 7 .8 percent in 2020 as the economy in 
the second quarter was severely affected mainly by the strict containment measures both 
domestic and abroad . However, latest data suggested better -than-expected developments in 
seve ral economic growth components, including private and public investment as well as 
private consumption that gradually recovered . Nevertheless, Thailand ’s tourism and 
merchandise exports continued to contract  markedly . In 2021, the economy was projected  
Monetary Policy Report  September 2020                                                                                                                      7 to expand 3 .6 percent , as merchandise exports would gradually improve . Meanwhile, exports 
of services would recover at a slower rate as the re -opening of the country would only allow a 
limited number of foreign tourists . With regard to domestic demand, public  expenditure would 
remain an important economic driver . Meanwhile, private consumption would gradually pick 
up, but would be restrained by vulnerable and highly uncertain household income as well as 
elevated household debt . Therefore, the economic recovery  would take at least two years 
before returning to the pre -pandemic level .  
Assumptions underlying the economic projection  in this report  are summarized as 
follows . First, there would be no severe second -wave outbreak of the COVID -19 in Thailand . 
Second, t he re -opening of the country to foreign tourists would commence in the fourth quarter 
of 2020, but only for a limited number of tourists due to strict screening and quarantine 
measures . Third, there would be a widespread availability of COVID -19 vaccines i n Thailand 
from the fourth quarter of 2021 onward . 
The tourism sector would recover slowly due to the prolonged COVID -19 outbreak 
situation abroad . As a result, the re -opening of the country to foreign tourists would be 
uncertain and would only allow a lim ited number of tourists . The re -opening was expected to 
commence with the Special Tourist Visa (STV) scheme in the fourth quarter of 2020, with strict 
screening and quarantine measures . The number of foreign tourists was thus projected to 
record 6 .7 million and 9 million in 2020 and 2021, respectively . 
The value of Thai merchandise exports would decline 8 .2 percent in 2020 . Exports to 
ASEAN and the Middle East remained subdued in line with the outlook of trading partner 
economies, while exports to maj or advanced economies and China started to pick up . In 2021, 
exports were projected to grow 4.5 percent, but the recovery would be gradual due to trade 
protectionist measures and slow economic recovery in trading partner economies . Moreover, 
a large propor tion of Thai merchandise exports was affected by the COVID -19, especially 
automobiles, and machinery and equipment . 
The current account balance was projected to register a surplus of 14 .0 billion and  
14.6 billion U .S. dollars in 2020 and 2021, respectivel y. The current account balance was 
revised down from the previous forecast due to a larger deficit in the services balance, mainly 
as a result of a sharp decline in tourism receipts . Meanwhile, trade balance would register a 
smaller surplus due to the incr ease in the value of merchandise imports, in line with larger -
than-expected merchandise exports volume and domestic demand in 2021, as well as higher 
global crude oil prices . 
Private consumption would contract in 2020 before expanding in 2021 . Looking ahea d, 
consumption was expected to expand at a slower rate than previously assessed as the labor 
market remained vulnerable . The number of workers unemployed or underemployed (working 
less than 4 hours per day ) would remain high, while employed workers were ex pected to earn 
less than previously due to both lower wages and overtime . Household debt would also rise . 
Nonetheless, government measures would help shore up purchasing power to some extent . 
Private investment would sharply decline despite better -than-expected outturns in the 
second quarter of 2020 . The contraction would be due to high levels of excess production 
capacity and uncertainties surrounding the economic recovery in Thailand and abroad . 
Nevertheless, infrastructure investment projects, especia lly the public -private partnership  
Monetary Policy Report  September 2020                                                                                                                      8 (PPP) projects both within and outside the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC) as well as 
investment in the 5G network, would help boost confidence and private investment to a certain 
extent . This would facilitate a gradual r ecovery of private investment . 
Going forward, the Thai economy would remain highly uncertain and could face 
downside risks, depending primarily on the impact of the COVID -19. The possibilities 
that the economy would underperform the baseline projection wou ld be due to the 
following factors . First, the global economy could enter a severe recession, which would 
then weigh on Thai merchandise exports . Second, Thailand could experience the second 
wave of the COVID -19 outbreak, triggering another round of lockdo wn measures in some 
areas . Third, the recovery of the tourism sector could be slow . Fourth, government relief 
measures could be delayed and smaller than expected . Fifth, balance sheets of businesses 
could deteriorate and thus caused many businesses to shut  down permanently . Sixth, default 
risks of businesses and households could significantly increase . On the other hand, there 
were  possibilities that the economy would outperform the baseline projection due to (1) 
a faster -than-expected development of COVID -19 vaccines and medicines, (2) better -than-
expected impacts of additional government stimulus and credit relief measures, (3) a larger -
than-expected expansion of domestic demand driven by infrastructure investment and PPP 
projects which could incentivize t he private sector to invest more than expected, and (4) more 
relocations of production base to Thailand of multinational corporations thanks to Thailand ’s 
success in containing the spread of the virus . 
Headline inflation was projected to be negative in 2020 mainly because of the sharp fall 
in oil prices in the second quarter . Nonetheless, latest data suggested that headline 
inflation would be higher than previously assessed . This was on account of a gradual 
increase in crude oil prices in response to hig her oil demand, following the relaxation of 
containment measures in several countries, and the reduction in oil production in accordance 
with the agreement among major oil producers . In addition, food prices increased due to 
supply -side factors, while core  inflation edged up because of a smaller -than-expected impact 
of government measures to reduce utility expenses . The Committee thus projected 
headline inflation to be negative 0 .9 percent in 2020 and turn positive at a level close to 
the lower bound of the  target at 1 .0 percent in 2021 . Core inflation was projected to be 
0.3 and 0 .2 percent in 2020 and 2021, respectively . In this regard, there remained 
downside risks to headline and core inflation projections in line with risks to crude oil 
prices and the e conomic growth projection .   
Monetary Policy Report  September 2020                                                                                                                      9 1. The Global Economy  
The COVID -19 containment measures resulted in temporary disruptions of global economic 
activities and severely affected Thailand ’s trading partner  economies . Advanced economies 
and Asia (excluding China ) were expected to enter a recession this year . However, a 
series of financial and fiscal measures implemented would help alleviate the impacts and 
restore the economy in the period ahead . 
 In the second quarter of 2020, advanced economies contracted markedly owing 
to containment measures implemented in the U .S., the euro area and Japan . This 
consequently led to a widespread disruptions of economic activities, caused  a continued 
contraction from the previous quarter . Such contraction was particularly s een in manufacturing 
production, consumption, and investment . Exports also shrank in line with global demand .  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 In 2020, advanced economies were projected to enter a recession with severe 
contraction expected in the first half of 2020, before gradual ly recovering in the second 
half of 2020,  following the gradual relaxation of containment measures . Consumption 
was expected to gradually recover following the re -opening of the cities, but the recovery 
would be restrained in the period ahead due to follow ing factors . First, the labor market had 
yet to fully recover, both in the manufacturing and services sectors (Chart 1 .1). Second, the 
new wave of the outbreak in several countries could trigger another round of strict containment 
measures . Third, spending  patterns have changed in line with the new normal, such as 
working from home which led to less commutes and away -from-home spending . Fourth, new 
forms of tourism which allowed for travelling only among designated cities would cause 
tourism -related busines ses to be unable to recover fully during the initial phase . Meanwhile, 
manufacturing sector would gradually recover, (Chart 1 .2) in line with domestic demand that 
started to improve and declining inventories . Nevertheless, production capacity was expected 
to be lower than the pre -pandemic level due to weak global demand and uncertainties 
surrounding re -intensifying trade tensions between the U .S. and China . However, financial, 
and fiscal measures previously implemented would support the economic recovery in  the 
period ahead .

Asian economies were projected to contract as a result of containment measures . However, 
a series of financial and fiscal measures implemented wou ld help shore up the economy in 
the period ahead .  
 The Chinese economy resumed growth in the second quarter of 2020 after 
having contracted in the previous quarter following the relaxation of containment 
measures in the beginning of the second 
quarter . Exports and investment expanded, 
while consumption still contracted . In 2020, 
the Chinese economy was expected to 
slow down less than previously assessed 
in line with outlook of the  manufacturing 
production and merchandise exports, as 
well as domestic demand that benefited 
from government measures . This was 
reflected in economic indicators in August 
that resumed growth . (Chart 1 .3) Looking 
ahead, the Chinese economy would 
recover in line with merchandise exports 
that gradually improved in consistent with 
the outlook of external demand . This would be particularly observed in exports of medical 
equipment and electronics . In addition, a series of government measures  implemented would 
help shore up the economy in the period ahead .  
 Asian economies (excluding Japan and China ) in the second quarter of 2020 
continued to contract from the previous quarter as a result of the COVID -19 pandemic 
and containment measures in some countries which affected consumption, investment, 
manufacturing production, and exports . In 2020, Asian economies were expected to 
contract more than previously assessed as the pandemic caused a larger -than-expected 
impact on economic activities . In addition, some countri es, including Indonesia and the 
Philippines, experienced a more  severe pandemic, affecting  the recovery outlook of domestic 
demand and tourism in the period ahead . Asian exports would continue to be weighed down 
by the outlook of the slowdown in global tra de, except South Korea and Taiwan whose exports 
comprised of a large proportion of  electronics products, while demand for electronics products 
increased in response to working from home . However, continuous implementation of 
economic recovery measures in m any countries would shore up the economy to some extent .  
Governments in many countries worldwide continued to implement financial and fiscal 
measures to alleviate the economic impacts of the COVID -19 pandemic   
 Governments in many countries worldwide continued to implement additional 
measures including relief measures aiming particularly at SMEs, households, and 
employment . However, governments in many advanced economies started to face limitations 
in implementing additional measures given less fiscal policy space, as reflected in the 
historically high level of public debt to GDP . Meanwhile, central banks in advanced 
economies continued to maintain accommodative monetary policy, including both 
quantitative easing and low policy interest rates . The Feder al Reserve (Fed) signaled a

policy framework . This framework would allow the inflation rate to be above the target of 2 
percent for an extended period in order to compensate the lower -than-target inflation in the 
past. This implied that the U .S. policy rate would remain low for longer . 
 Regional central banks continued to maintain accommodative monetary policy . 
Most central banks maintained their policy rates  at low  levels, while some central banks, 
whose policy rate remained high, eased monetary policy further . These included Bangko 
Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), Bank Negara Malaysia  (BNM ), and Bank Indonesia (BI). Moreover, 
BI conducted direct financing by purchasing government bonds in the primary market to 
support high fiscal deficits during the recent COVID -19 pandemic .  
Thailand ’s trading partner economies in 2020 were projected to contract slightly less than 
previously assessed as advanced economies recovered fast er than expected mainly due to 
domestic demand . However, there remained risks that trading partners ’ economic growth 
would underperform the baseline projection  due to several factors .  
Trading partner economies in 2020 were projected to contract less than 
previously assessed in the previous Monetary Policy Report . This was due to  a faster -
than-expected recovery of domestic demand in the U .S., euro area, and China . This was a 
result of the relaxation of containment measures, as well as measures to relief and  restore 
domestic economy . Meanwhile, Asian economies were expected to contract more than 
previously assessed in response to global trade slowdown which weighed on Asian exports, 
and prolonged COVID -19 pandemic in several countries . However, a series of fi nancial and 
fiscal measures implemented would partly help the economy not to severely contract . In 2021, 
trading partner economies were expected to recover as the pandemic started to subside and 
due to gradual relaxation of containment measures . The Commit tee thus revised up 
economic growth projections for Thailand ’s trading partners to a 4 .5 percent 
contraction in 2020, followed by a 4 .4 percent expansion in 2021 (Table 1 .1).   
 The Committee assessed that there remained risks that trading partner 
economie s would underperform the baseline projection due to several factors, but the 
likelihood  that advanced economies would re -impose strict and nationwide containment 
measures declined . Nevertheless, the possibilities that trading partner economies 
could underperform the baseline projection included  (1) a more severe and prolonged 
COVID -19 pandemic than previously assessed due to an emergence of the second wave of 
the outbreak, which could lead many countries to re -impose strict containment measures, (2) 
greater vulnerabilities in the global financial system owing to increased default risks among 
corporate and governments in some countries, or credit rating downgrades and (3) re-
intensifying trade tensions, particularly between the U .S. and China . On the ot her hand, there 
were also possibilities that trading partner economies could outperform the baseline projection  
owing to (1) a faster -than-expected ending of the pandemic due to effective healthcare 
measures in many countries and successful development of vaccines and medicines for the 
COVID -19, and (2) larger -than-expected effects of financial and fiscal measures in many 
countries in stimulating the economy .

Capital flows returned to both equity and bond markets of emerging markets, where 
concerns among investors in the global financial markets declined somewhat due to a 
lesser -than-expected contraction of advanced economies and continued accommodative 
monetary policy .  
 In the third quarter of 2020, concerns among investors in the global  financial markets 
subsided , reflected in a decline in the VIX index1/ (Chart 1 .4) from June 2020 . This was on 
account of a lesser contraction of advanced economies than expected by investors in the 
global financial markets and the continued accommodative monetary policies of advanced 
economies . In particular, the new monetary policy framework adopted by the Fed implied that 
the U .S. policy rate would be low for longer . As a result, this triggered risk -on sentiment where 
investors had resumed their  investme nt in risky assets, particularly equities . This was reflected 
in rising  MSCI index worldwide (Chart 1 .5). However, Asian economies (excluding China ) 
would recover slowly due to the economic structure that relied mainly on merchandise exports 
and tourism . This prompted  investors to remain cautious in investing in equities of emerging 
markets and invested in markets with relatively stronger external stability .

Dubai crude oil price in the third quarter of 2020 rose from the previous quarter due to 
gradual improvement of demand following the relaxation of lockdown measures and the 
production cut in accordance with the agreement among major oil producers . 
 Dubai crude oil price in the third 
quarter of 2020 rose from the previous 
quarter as overall demand gradually 
picked up following the relaxation of the 
lockdown measures in many countries, 
and the OPEC and its allies including 
Russia continued to comply with the 
agreement on crude oil production cut  
since May  2020 . However, crude oil prices 
did not increase much as oil demand for 
transportation and air tr avel remained 
subdued owing to the  COVID -19 pandemic . 
Moreover, some oil producers in the U .S. 
resumed  production after crude oil prices 
rose beyond the break -even point at 40 
U.S. dollars per barrel .  
 The Committee thus revised up the projection of Dubai  crude oil prices in 2020  
to 41 .5 U.S. dollars per barrel from 35 .1 U.S. dollars per barrel and also revised up the 
projection of Dubai crude oil prices in 2021 to 45 .8 U.S. dollars per barrel from 37 .0 U.S. 
dollars per barrel . Crude oil prices were expected to gradually rise in line with the gradual 
recovery of the global economy . However, crude oil prices might not increase much as crude 
oil production might increase following the relaxation of the agreement on production cut of 
the OPEC and its all ies, and as the U .S. resumed production following the crude oil price 
increases . However, there were risks that crude oil prices could turn out lower than the 
assessment . This would be on account of a weaker -than-expected demand for crude oil due 
to (1) a more severe and prolonged impact of COVID -19 pandemic on the global economy 
than expected, (2) concerns over the second -wave of the COVID -19 outbreak, and (3) re-
intensifying trade tensions between the U .S. and China, and a higher -than-expected crude oil 
production as the OPEC and its allies failed to comply with agreement until the end of the 
agreement . On the other hand, crude oil prices could be higher than the assessment given a 
more severe -than-expected geopolitical risk, and a faster -than-expected development of 
vaccines for COVID -19.

2.1 Recent Developments  
The Thai economy contracted substantially in the second quarter of 2020 due to containment  
measures to control the spread of the virus . However, the Thai economy was expected to  
gradually recover in the third quarter in line with the relaxation of containment measures 
imposed both in Thailand and abroad .   
 In the second quarter of 2020, the Thai economy contracted substantially at 12 .2 
percent from the same period las t year due to external and domestic demand  slowdown 
in light of strict containment measures imposed worldwide . This led to temporary 
disruptions of economic activities across several  sectors . Exports of services fell sharply 
because of international travel  restrictions which resulted in no inbound foreign tourists  since 
April. Merchandise exports (excluding gold ) and manufacturing  in almost all industries 
contracted on account of (1) a large drop in  demand from Thailand ’s trading partners and 
global trade volume, and (2) supply chain disruptions caused by temporary suspension  of 
international transport . With regard to domestic demand, private consumption declined due to 
falling income of both farm and non -farm households as well as weakening consumer 
confidence, despite supports from government relief measures . Private investment continued 
to contract on the back of weak domestic and external demand, subdued business confidence, 
and high level of  excess production capacity . Nevertheless, public expenditure expanded on 
account of accelerated disbursement of current and capital expenditures . 
 In the third quarter of 2020, latest indicators pointed to a gradual recovery of the 
Thai economy on the back of the relaxation of cont ainment measures imposed both in 
Thailand and abroad . However,  economic activities were still lower than the pre -pandemic  
level. Signs of recovery were observed in merchandise exports (excluding gold ) and manufacturing  
in several product categories in line  with smaller contraction in most trading partner  economies . 
Meanwhile, exports of services would  continue to fall as a result of international travel restrictions . 
Private consumption was expected to gradually  pick up in tandem with the relaxation of 
containment measures, but would remain low due to falling household income, weak 
consumer confidence, and rising household debt . Private investment would also contract in 
line with subdued  business confidence . However, public expenditure, both current and capital 
expenditures, would remain a key economic growth driver .  
Overall  household income remained vulnerable .  
 Overall household purchasing power remained vulnerable . Non-farm income  
was affected by the COVID -19 outbreak and containment measures, as ref lected in the rise 
in the number of insured workers applying for unemployment benefits (Section 38 of the Social 
Security Act ) (Chart 2 .1). However, working hours of employees affected by the temporary 
suspension of business improved somewhat following the  relaxation of containment measures , 
but were still  lower than that in the previous  period . Moreover, the impact was uneven among 
economic sectors with sectors heavily reliant on external demand facing more severe impacts .

Monetary Policy Report  September 2020                                                                                                                      15  Farm income  increased slightly,  (Chart 2 .2) mainly due to higher rice and rubber prices . 
Prices of rice rose on account of a lower agricultural output caused by the drought and a lower 
supply from India, a major global rice exporter, due to  transportation disruption during the 
COVID -19 outbreak . Prices of rubber edged up in tandem with global prices on account of 
stronger demand from China and lower supply from other rubber exporting countries inclu ding 
Thailand . Meanwhile, agricultural output remained  stable . Going forward, risk that warranted 
continued monitoring included  weather conditions . Although  the increase in rainfall was 
expected to  help alleviate impact of the drought to some extent, overa ll water levels in dams 
remained low as a result of uneven rainfall distribution . In addition, potential floods in some 
areas should be carefully monitored as these could also affect agricultural output . 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Headline inflation was less negative than  the previous quarter mainly owing to higher 
energy and fresh food prices . Core inflation edged up due to the end of government 
measures  to reduce cost of living and somewhat stronger demand following the relaxation 
of containment measures . 
 Headline inflation in the first two months  
of the third quarter of 2020 averaged at -0.74 
percent, up from -2.67 percent in the previous 
quarter,  (Chart 2 .3) on account of the following 
factors . First, energy prices gradually increased  
due to higher domestic retail oil prices in 
tandem with global crude oil prices, and the 
end of government relief measures to cut 
electricity charges during the COVID -19 outbreak . 
Second, fresh food prices began to rise, 
especially meat prices, thanks to s tronger 
domestic demand following the relaxation of 
containment measures and stronger external 
demand in light of the outbreak of African 
swine fever  in neighboring countries . Moreover, prices of vegetables increased significantly in 
August as  crops were s everely damaged by heavy rainfall .

while long -term government bond yields rose slightly from both domestic and external factors . 
 During the third quarter of 2020, overall financial conditions remained 
accommodative with real policy interest rate remaining low  relative  to those of other  
emerging market economies (Chart 2 .6). Short -term money market rates stabilized at low 
levels close to the policy rate  (Chart 2 .7). Meanwhile,  long -term government bond yields  
rose  slightly  (Chart 2 .8) in tandem with the U .S. Treasury yields, which edged up in response  
to better risk sentiment among investors . The improved risk sentiment was on account of the 
relaxation of containment measures, the Fe d’s new monetary policy framework that implied  a 
lower -for-longer U .S. policy rate, and better -than-expected U .S. economic outturns . Moreover, 
supply of long -term Thai government bonds increased due to government bond  restructuring 
by bond -switching activi ties. Nevertheless, long -term government bond yields did not increase 
much  owing to  a potentially lower -than-expected government bond supply in the fourth quarter 
of 2020, increased tension between the U .S. and China, and the second -wave  outbreak of 
COVID -19 in many  countries .

household credit growth accelerated slightly in line with household spending following the 
relaxation of containment measures .  
 Private sector loans3/ and bond 
issuances (private credit ) grew  at a slower  
rate of 3 .8 percent in July 2020  from the 
same period last year (Chart 2 .13). Private 
credit growth was supported  by businesses  
affected by the COVID -19 which raised 
funds to increase liquidity at the beginning 
of the second quarter, and by the government  
soft loan programs previously implemented . 
Business loans and corporate bond 
issuances  expanded  3.3 percent in July 
2020 from the same period last year (Chart 
2.14). Corporate financing through bond 
issuances softened quite substantially at the 
beginning of the second quarte r due to tight 
liquidity conditions in the bond market . 
However , in June and July 2020, corporate 
financing through  bond issuances started 
to pick up somewhat, especially by large 
corporates . Meanwhile, business credit 
growth moderated since the beginning of the second quarter mainly due to businesses that 
were  affected by the COVID -19, especially those related to manufacturing and trade  (Chart 
2.15). Household credit expanded 4 .3 percent from the same period last year and slightly 
accelerated from the seco nd quarter . Such expansion was mainly driven by  mortgage loans,  
partly  as a result of sales promotion  offered by developers and  some delayed purchases since 
the peak of the COVID -19 outbreak .

was expected to continue expanding . In particular, businesses would continue to raise funds 
through credit market in order to manage liquidity to cushion against the economic impact of 
the COVID -19 outbreak . However, business credit growth might slow down somewhat because 
some businesses already secured loans  for liquidity provision purposes in the previous period . 
Financial institutions would also remain cautious in extending loans, especially for large 
corporates, gi ven the highly uncertain economic outlook .4 / In addition, corporate bond 
financing was projected to rise . Demand for household credits would also increase, particularly 
credit card and consumer loans, thanks to the relaxation of containment measures impose d 
in Thailand . 
In the third quarter, the baht against the U .S. dollar and the nominal effective exchange 
rate (NEER ) depreciated relative to the previous quarter  with volatile movements  of the 
baht throughout the quarter in response to investors ’ risk sent iment . 
In the third quarter of 2020, the baht against the U .S. dollar depreciated relative 
to the previous quarter . The baht exhibited volatile movements throughout the quarter in 
response to investors ’ risk sentiment (Chart 2 .16). At the beginning of the  quarter, the baht 
weakened rapidly given concerns over  risk of the second -wave  outbreak in Thailand . 
Businesses in Thailand also purchased  U.S. dollars for profit repatriation and overseas 
investment . Subsequently, the baht gradually strengthened  in tande m with other regional 
currencies  on the back of weaker U .S. dollars . U.S. dollar depreciation was on account of the  
improved risk sentiment among global investors  due to the Fed ’s new monetary policy 
framework that implied a lower -for-longer U .S. policy ra te, and a better -than-expected U .S. 
economic outturns . Nonetheless, the baht weakened somewhat toward the end of the quarter 
in light of investor concerns over the increased tension between the U .S. and China, as well 
as political uncertainty and risk of the second -wave outbreak in Thailand . Thus, the baht 
averaged at 31 .26 baht to U .S. dollar in September 2020 (as of September 22, 2020 ), a 0.4 
percent depreciation from the average of June 2020 .

The Nominal Effective Exchange 
Rate (NEER ) index averaged at 121 .34 in  
September 2020 (as of September 22, 2020 ), 
2.3 percent lower than the average of June 
2020 . This was attributable to a larger degree 
of baht depreciation than most trading partner 
currencies (Chart 2 .17). Meanwhile, the 
preliminary  Real  Effective Exchange Rate 
(REER ) in August  2020 weakened 0 .9 percent  
from an average of June 2020 . Going forward , 
exchange rates would likely remain volatile 
pertaining to risk of the second -wave outbreak  
in several countries, and  economic policies in 
major  advanced economies .  
Financial system stability was still subject to high risk  from this year ’s large contraction of 
the economic outlook, especially driven by  financial positions of households and businesses . 
However, proactive financial and credit measures would help mitigate such risk . 
Financial system stability was still subject to high risk from this year ’s large contraction 
of the economic outlook in light of the COVID -19 outbreak . However, fiscal  sector stability 
remained sound with capacity to  support the economic recovery and restructuring . Although 
the ratio of public debt  to GDP was expected to rise, this would be at a manageable level . 
Moreover, stability of financial  institutions remained robust, as reflected by adequately high 
levels of c ommercial banks ’ capital buffers and reserves, providing cushion against risks of 
deteriorating credit quality . Risks to financial system stability that warranted close monitoring 
could be summarized as follows . 
1. Household financial positions were fragil e with risk of defaults . Although 
household debt continued to decelerate, household debt -to-GDP ratio remained high at 83 .8 
percent at the end of the second quarter of 2020 given  the economic contraction . In the second 
half of 2020, household debt -to-GDP r atio was projected to increase mainly in line with 
household demand for credits, which would likely rise in tandem with spending demand 
following the relaxation of containment measures .  
The Bank of Thailand therefore continued to  introduce a number of proactive 
financial and credit assistance measures for retail borrowers in order to alleviate the 
impact of COVID -19. These measures  helped curtail the deterioration of household 
credit quality to some extent,  as reflected in  the stable NPL ratio of consum er loans  at 3.1 
percent at the end of the second quarter of 2020 . However, debt servicing ability of households 
would need to be monitored closely after  some government relief measures ended . In this 
light, the Bank of Thailand recently launched debt conso lidation program for retail borrowers . 
(Box: Additional public financial and credit measures ) in order to further alleviate  debt burden 
for households .

Monetary Policy Report  September 2020                                                                                                                      22 2. Business financial positions were vulnerable with risk of defaults . The loss of 
business revenue in light of the COVID -19 outbreak led to a continued  decline in operating 
profit margins  (OPM ) and interest coverage ratio (ICR). In particular, businesses that were 
highly  vulnerable included,  first, tourism -related services that were  severely affected by 
international travel restrictions and unable to fully recover despite some improvement in 
domestic demand . This resulted in large excess supply, especially in hotel and airline 
businesses . Second, other highly vulnerable businesses included tourism -related t rade and 
trade businesses, such as department stores,  that were affected by lockdown measures in 
high-risk areas and  sluggish recovery of economic activities . Third, automobiles and auto 
parts also suffered from weaker domestic and external demand, shortag es of raw materials 
caused by supply chain disruption, and lockdown measures in some  countries which  
prevented export  deliveries even when the purchase order had been placed . The adaptability 
and debt servicing ability of businesses thus warranted close mo nitoring . The public sector  
recently  introduced additional financial and credit measures to support liquidity and alleviate 
debt burden of businesses . (Box: Additional public financial and credit measures ) 
 3. The real estate market remained fragile, where  most developers reduced  
new project launches  in light of  falling demand . This was reflected in  the decline in new 
project launches of low -rise residences and condominiums in Bangkok and its vicinities by  29 
percent and 86 percent, respectively, in the second quarter of 2020, relative to the previous 
year. However, the real estate market was still subject to high risk, as reflected in  the 
longer time -to-go for low -rise residences and condominiums as well as large excess 
supply, especially among non -SET d evelopers  (Chart 2 .18). This was as these developers 
faced constraints in modifying their projects to meet buyers ’ preferences,  and had limited 
capacity to compete on price and carry out sales promotion . Risk pertaining to non -SET 
developers thus warranted  continued monitoring, particularly if demand  recovery turned out 
slower than expected, which would affect liquidity of these developers going forward .

The Thai economy would contract in 2020 less than previously assessed in the previous 
Monetary Policy Report . However,  the economic recovery in 2021 would be slower than 
expected mainly on account of tourism . Meanwhile, headline inflation was projected to be 
less negative . 
 Under the Committee ’s assessment,  the Thai economy was projected to contract 
7.8 percent in 2020,  less than the previous forecast  of 8.1 percent contraction in the 
previous Monetary Policy Report . The impact of the lockdown measures on the Thai 
economy in the second quarter was less severe than previously assessed, as observed in 
better -than-expected outturns across several economic growth components . Nevertheless, 
the outlook of Thailand ’s economic recovery in the period ahead remained highly uncertain  
due to the continued spread of COVID -19 globally, the expiration of economic relief measures 
at the end of the year, and the direction of government measures  going forward . In particular, 
the reopening of the country to  foreign tourists wa s expected to  allow a more limited number  
of tourists than previously forecasted . In 2021, the Thai economy  was thus projected to 
expand 3 .6 percent, lower than the previous assessment of 5 .0 percent in the previous 
Monetary Policy Report . The Committee projected that the Thai economy  would take at 
least two  years before returning to the pre -pandemic level (Chart 2 .19).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Assumptions  about  COVID -19 which underlined the economic projection in this 
report  included the followings . First, there would be no severe second -wave outbreak of the 
COVID -19 in Thailand . Second, the re -opening of the country to foreign tourists would be 
delayed by one quarter to the fourth quarter of 2020, and would only allow a limited number of 
foreign tourists due to strict screening and quarantine  measures . Third, there would be a 
widespread availability of COVID -19 vaccines in Thailand from the fourth quarter of 2021 onward . 
Headline inflation in 2020 was projected to be negative at 0 .9 percent,  less 
negative than the estim ate in the previous Monetary Policy Report . Headline inflation 
was assessed to be higher than previously projected  throughout the forecast horizon mainly 
due to supply -side factors . These factors included higher energy prices in line with assumptions

expected impact of measures to reduce public  utility  expenses . In 2021, headline inflation  was 
projected to be close to the lower bound of the target at 1 .0 percent .  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Summary of the key forecast assumptions  
 Trading partner economies were projected to expand slightly more than previously assessed 
on account of the faster -than-expected recovery of domestic demand in the U .S., the euro 
area and China,  thanks to the relaxation of containment measures  as well as  benefits from  
domestic economic relief and recovery packages . Nevertheless, trading partner economies in 
Asia would contract more than previously assessed in line with a  slowdown in global trade 
volume and prolonged COVID -19 outbreak in several countries . 
 The Federal funds rate was projected to be maintained at a range of  0.00 - 0.25 percent  
throughout the forecast horizon . In addition, the Fed ’s new monetary policy framework implied 
a lower -for-longer  U.S. policy rate .  
 Regional currencies (excluding the Chinese yuan ) appreciated more than previously projected 
throughout the forecast horizon mainly due to the weakening U .S. dollar, in line with the Fed ’s 
signal  on a longer period of accommodative  monetary policy . 
 The Dubai crude oil prices would increase throughout the forecast horizon on account of 
stronger demand following the relaxation of containment measures and the agreement to cut 
crude oil production of major oil producers . However, crude oil prices would remain low as  
U.S. oil producers resumed production, while demand remained weak in line with the global 
economic outlook  and the airline industry  that had yet to recover .  
 Farm income (excluding government support measures ) in 2020 contracted less than the 
previous projection due to  higher prices of rubber and rice . Farm income in 2021 would 
expand at a slower pace than previously assessed because this year ’s drought would affect 
next year ’s agricultural output, especially suga rcane . 
 Public spending  at current price declined in 2020 due to lower -than-expected government 
consumption, especially actual disbursement in the second quarter . Moreover, disbursement 
of public health program under the Emergency Decree  Authorizing the Min istry of Finance to 
Raise Loans to Solve Problems, to  Remedy and Restore the Economy and Society as 
Affected by the Coronavirus Disease Pandemic in 2019 (B.E. 2563 ). delayed longer than 
expected, where part of the budget was postponed to 2021 .

Merchandise exports would exhibit a smaller -than-expected contraction this year, where 
growth would turn positive in the following year . 
The value of Thai merchandise exports in 2020 would exhibit a smaller 
contraction  than previously assessed, both in terms of volume and price . With regard 
to exports volume, data outturns showed a smaller -than-expected contraction in the second 
quarter of 2020 . In particular, this was driven by exports to major advanced economies and 
China, and partly by  exports  of gold that were higher than usual consistent with the historical 
high gold prices in the global  market . Meanwhile, prices of merchandise exports were 
projected to rise, mainly owing to prices of goods that were sensitive to movements of crude 
oil prices . Looking ahead, Thai merchandise exports would gradually  recover  with pressures 
coming from  the slowdown in global trade volume caused by trade protectionist measures 
and a slower -than-expected economic recovery of major trading partners, such as ASEAN 
and the Middle East . Moreover, a large proportion of Thai  merchandise exports was affected 
by the COVID -19, especially automobiles and machinery and equipment . These products 
were highly sensitive to changes in income  of trading partners . Meanwhile, proporti on of 
electronic products that benefited from work -from-home measure  was low relative to  that of 
other regional countries (Box: The post -COVID -19 recovery of Thai exports under structural 
constraints ). The Committee thus projected the value of merchandise exports to contract  
8.2 percent in 2020 before expanding 4 .5 percent in 2021 .  
Exports of services were expected to contract more severely  in line with foreign tourist figures . 
The tourism  sector was projected to recover more slowly than the previous 
assessment . This was because the COVID -19 outbreak situation abroad would be more 
prolonged than previously expected, while  second -wave  outbreak in several countries and 
the outbreak situation in some countries had yet  to be contained . As a result, the re -opening 
of the country to foreign tourists would be uncertain and would only allow a  limited  number of 
tourists . The re -opening  was expected to  commence with  the Special Tourist Visa (STV) 
scheme in the fourth quarter of 2020, with strict screening and qua rantine measures . The 
number of foreign tourists would thus remain low until the scope of the re -opening would be 
expanded  in the latter half of 2021 . The foreign tourist  figures were therefore projected 
to be 6 .7 and 9 .0 million in 2020 and 2021,  respectively, lower than previously assessed

Monetary Policy Report  September 2020                                                                                                                      26 in the previous Monetary Policy Report . Although spending per head of foreign tourists 
under the STV scheme would be much higher than the average because of high daily 
spending and longer period of stay, it woul d not be sufficient to offset the decline in tourism 
receipts caused by the fall in foreign tourists . Exports of services were therefore projected to 
decline throughout the forecast horizon . 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The current account balance was projected to register  a surplus of 14 .0 and 14 .6 
billion U .S. dollars in 2020 and 2021, respectively . The current account balance was 
revised down from the previous assessment due to a larger deficit in the services balance, 
mainly as a result of a marked decline in tourism re ceipts . Meanwhile, trade balance was 
expected to record a slightly smaller  surplus as the value of merchandise imports increased 
quite substantially, despite the increase in the value of merchandise exports . This was in line 
with larger -than-expected merchandise exports volume and domestic demand in 2020, as 
well as higher global crude oil prices . 
Private consumption would contract less than the previous forecast, but was expected to 
expand at a slower rate than previously assessed in the period ahead . 
Private consumption would  contract in 2020 less than previously assessed 
following the relaxation of lockdown measures to nearly normal situation  (Chart 2 .21). Private 
consumption was additionally supported by government measures, such as cash transfers f or 
those affected by the outbreak,  domestic tourism stimulus campaign, and private consumption 
stimulus package at the beginning of the fourth quarter . These measures  would help shore up 
purchasing power to some extent . In addition, farm  income would partly improve in line with 
increased prices of rice and rubber . However, private consumption in 2021 was expected 
to slow down more than previously assessed due to highly vulnerable and uncertain 
household income,  as well as  a large number of workers unem ployed or underemployed 
(working less than 4 hours per day ). In particular, workers  in the services sector, whose revenue  
depended on foreign tourists,  would  be severely affected by the delay in the extensive

recovered slowly, such as automobiles and machinery and equipment, would also be 
particularly affected . In addition, employed workers  were expected to earn less  than previously 
due to both lower wages and overtim e. Consumer confidence would remain subdued, while 
household debt would remain elevated . These factors would prompt households to be more 
cautious in their spending, which would weigh on private consumption in the period ahead .  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Private investment in 2020  would  continue to sharply decline, but was expected to 
gradually recover .  
 Private investment in 2020 would continue to sharply decline  but would record 
a smaller contraction  than the previous projection , in line with better -than-expected 
outturns in the second quarter of 2020 . Factors supporting private investment remained weak 
due to high levels of excess production capacity and uncertainties surrounding the economic 
recovery in Thailand and abroad . Nevertheless, infrastructure  investment projects, especially 
the public -private partnership (PPP) projects both within and outside the  Eastern Economic 
Corridor (EEC) as well as investment in the 5G network, would help boost confidence  and 
private investment to a certain extent . This w ould facilitate a gradual recovery of private 
investment in the period ahead . 
Projection of headline inflation would be higher than previously assessed . 
Projection of headline inflation in 2020 would be negative at 0 .9 percent, higher 
than previously assessed in the previous Monetary Policy Report . This was on account 
of higher -than-expected data  outturns . Moreover, government measures to reduce public 
utility expenses had a smaller -than-expected impact,  while prices a cross all product categories  
increased in line with higher crude oil prices . In addition, food prices edged up due to supply -side 
factors . In 2021, headline inflation would remain close to the lower bound of the target

crude oil prices . Core inflation was projected to slightly increase, but would remain low at  
0.3 and 0 .2 in 2020 and 2021, respectively . 
Economic and inflation projections would be  subject to high uncertainties and  downside risks . 
Going forward, the Thai economy would remain highly uncertain and could face 
downside risks, depending primarily on the impact of the COVID -19. This was reflected 
in a wide fan chart that tilted toward the downside (Chart  2.22). Nevertheless, the 
probability that the economy would  underperform the baseline projection was lower than that 
in the previous Monetary Policy Report , due to better -than-expected outturns in the second 
quarter of 2020 and the inclusion of some downs ide risks into the baseline projection, 
especially the reduction in the number of foreign tourists in 2021 . The possibilities that the 
Thai economy would underperform the baseline projection would be due to the 
following factors . First, the global economy  could enter a severe recession  stemming from 
factors such as a new wave of the COVID -19 outbreak or global financial instabilities, which 
would then weigh on Thai merchandise exports . Second, Thailand  could experience the 
second wave of the COVID -19 outbre ak, triggering another round of lockdown  measures in 
some areas . Third, the recovery of the tourism sector could be slow due to changes in 
behavior of tourists and longer -than-expected delay in the extensive re -opening of the country 
to foreign tourists . Fourth, government relief  measures could be delayed and smaller than 
expected . Fifth, balance sheets of businesses could  deteriorate and thus caused many 
businesses to shut down permanently . This would cause scar effects, resulting in slow 
economic recovery  even after the outbreak ended . Sixth, default risks of businesses  and 
households could significantly increase . On the other hand, there were possibilities that the 
economy would outperform the baseline projection  due to  (1) a faster -than-expected 
development of COVID -19 vaccines and medicines, (2) better -than-expected impacts of 
additional government stimulus measures to shore up consumption and credit  relief 
measures,  (3) larger - than-expected expansion of domestic demand driven by infrastructure  
investment and PPP projects which could incentivize the private sector to invest more than 
expected, and (4) more relocations of production base to Thailand of multinational 
corporations thanks to Thailand ’s success in containing the spread of the virus . Meanwhile,  
there remained downside risks to headline and core  inflation projections  (Chart 2 .23 
and 2 .24) in line with risks to crude oil prices and the  economic growth projection .

Monetary Policy Report  September 2020                                                                                                                      30  Investigating Thai labor market … 
how well it recovered after the city re -opening  
 The COVID -19 pandemic severely affected the Thai labor market . The fact suggested 
that, first, in the second quarter of 2020 during the city lockdown, the number of unemployed 
and underemployed5/ workers totaled  6 million persons . The number of unemployed workers 
almost doubled, while the number of underemployed workers was at the historical high . 
Although the figures improved following the city re -opening and as economic activities started 
to rec over, the number of workers unemployed and underemployed remained high at around 
4 million persons . Second, the impact was uneven across economic sectors, where sectors 
relying on external demand were severely affected and would recover more slowly than ot her 
sectors . Third, more than 1 million workers returned to their domicile, with some remaining 
unemployed . Those that sought for new jobs were mostly employed in sectors with low 
productivity and wages, especially in the agricultural sector .    
 Against  the backdrop of vulnerable recovery of the labor market and high uncertainties 
arising from  various risk factors, the number of unemployed and underemployed workers 
would remain high, especially workers in tourism - and export -related sectors . Therefore, lab or 
policy would  be more important in creating job and income, as well as enhancing skill 
development for workers to be consistent with the changing economic structure after 
the COVID -19 subsided .   
Fact No .1 In the second quarter 
of 2020, the number of unemployed 
workers almost doubled and that of 
underemployed workers was at the 
historical high following disruptions of 
economic activities during the city 
lockdown . The number of unemployed 
workers rose from around 400 thousand 
to 750 thousand, while underemployed 
workers recorded high level of 5 .4 
million . (Chart 1 ) Underemployed segment 
should also be given importance as these 
workers, though not yet unemployed, earn 
low income given low working hours . This 
might not be enough to sustain the whole 
households . During the gradual re -
opening of the cities, the number of unemployed and underemployed workers improved 
somewhat from the lockdown period, but remained high . In August, unemployed 
workers recorded 720 thousand, while underemployed workers stood at 2.6 million . 
Moreover, unemployed workers under the Social Security System or requested for 
unemployment benefits continued to rise to 4 .4 thousand from 4 .0 thousand in June . Looking 
ahead, the recovery of the labor market would be highly uncertain due to various risk factors, 
particularly the gradual phasing out of government relief measures and uncertainty pertaining 
                                                             
5/ The Bank of Thailand defines “underemployed ” workers as employed workers working less than 4 hours per day . 
Chart 1 The number of unemployed workers had almost 
doubled and that of underemployed workers had been at

Monetary Policy Report  September 2020                                                                                                                      31    to the second wave of the outbreak . The number of unemployed and underemployed workers 
was thus expected to remain high .  
 Therefore,  expediting job creation, both full -time and part -time jobs, was 
considered  key measures in the short run to support unemployed and underemployed 
workers . Government should accelerate job creation to be sufficient in all areas, especially 
public work that would lead to local development and wealth distribution to the region . Part-
time job creation should also be promoted in tandem with skill development for underemployed 
workers in order to offer second jobs and additional source of income . In addition, gov ernment 
may consider extending the benefits for unemployed workers under the Social Security 
System for longer than the normal standard of 6 months, while taking this opportunity to link 
the benefits providing to unemployed workers with requirements for th ese workers to engage 
in skills development . This would ensure that these workers would be able to live, adjust, and find 
new jobs .  
Fact No .2 The impact was uneven across different economic sectors, where 
sectors heavily relying on external sector experienced severe impact from the COVID -
19. This was particularly seen in, first, hotel and tourism sector, as reflected by the 
number of temporary suspension of businesses under section 756/ in April that accelerated 35 
times from that of March (Chart 2 ). This 
resulted in considerable work hour losses, 
while workers that did not lose job were 
underemployed . Thus, overall income 
declined 29 percent and 33 .6 percent in 
June and August, respectively, relative to 
March . Looking ahead, workers in the 
hotel an d tourism sectors could face high 
risk of earning less or losing jobs if the 
second wave of the outbreak were to 
occur and consequently affected the 
policy to reopen the country for foreign 
tourists . Second, workers in the auto and 
auto parts sectors  were also heavily 
affected by the temporary suspension of 
businesses . Work hour losses  in April 
accelerated by 14 times those of March 
(Chart 2 ). Despite some moderation, the figure was still high at 9 times  of March due to falling 
demand both domestically and abroad . 
 For economic sectors  facing high impacts, government would  consider introducing 
incentive measures, including co -payment measure, for businesses with potential to 
sustain employment for workers in these economic sectors . The co -payment mea sure 
would ensure employment of these workers as well as employment of the newly graduates . 
This would help preserve the skills of workers, support workers and businesses with potential 
to survive, and maintain productivity a  country ’s competitiveness .  
                                                             
6/ Section 75 of the Labor Protection Act states that when it is necessary for an employer, for whatever cause other 
than a force majeure, to tempor ary suspend business in whole or in part, the employer shall pay wages to an 
employee in amount of not less than seventy -five percent of wages received by the employee before the 
suspension of business for the entire period which the employer does not require the employee to work .

auto and auto parts sectors decreased somewhat, yet 
was still high at 9 times of March 2020.

Monetary Policy Report  September 2020                                                                                                                      32  Fact No .3 More than 1 million workers returned to their domiciles  and had not yet 
returned since the city lockdown . This group of workers used to work in the city or industrial 
and tourism areas, such as Bangkok Metropolitan and its vicinity, Chonburi and Phuket . When 
these workers returned to their domiciles, although some of them managed to get new jobs in 
the areas, such jobs were rather concentrated in sectors with low productivity and wages 
including agricultural sector . (Chart 3 ) On the contrary, work ers unable to find new jobs would 
exacerbate unemployment and underemployment problem already occurred in the areas, 
especially in Nakhon Ratchasima and Nakhon Si Thammarat (dark blue shaded area, Chart 47/) 
 Therefore, government should take this opportunity to design area -based policies 
which  includes skill development measures consistent with economic activities in each area . If 
workers returned to their domiciles and largely went to the agricultural sector, government 
should thus promote develop ment of skills, such as smart farmer to upgrade skills for farmers .  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 In addition to expediting job and income creation, the government ’s skill 
development measures was another important issue necessarily to be implemented 
simultaneously . This was on account of structural change in the post -COVID environment . 
Moreover,  although the economy would be  fully recovered, employment pattern was expected 
to change from  the pre -COVID -19 period . Hence, skills development will require mechanism for 
cooperation between the public and private sectors, as well as appropriate design of incentive 
measures . This includes, for example, subsidizing the upskill and reskill of workers that would 
be demanded in the future and suitable with particular group of w orkers such as digital skills, 
geriatric nursing skills . This would enhance opportunity to get new jobs and earn higher income . 
 In conclusion, the Thai labor market has obviously become more vulnerable during the 
COVID -19 crisis and has recovered some what after the city re -opening . However, the labor 
market is expected remain vulnerable due to the gradual phasing out of government relief 
measures and uncertainty pertaining to the second wave of the outbreak both domestically 
and abroad . Thus, sufficien t job creation and appropriate skills development measures 
will be vital to support adjustment of Thai labor amid rising uncertainties . This would 
also help the economy to sustainably recover in line with the changing global context in the 
post-COVID envir onment that would never be the same again .

In the  recent periods, COVID -19 had severe and broad -based impacts on the global 
economy as well as international trade . While exports of many countries including Thailand 
have already bottomed out, the recovery remained uneven . The recovery of Thai exports 
was still slower than that of regional countries, as the structure of Thai exports was 
concentrated in the product seg ments and the markets that were slow to recover . 
Moreover, Thailand ’s participation in the global supply chain has declined . These thus 
had implications on the competitiveness of Thai exports in the long term . 
Thai exports faced a slow recovery and remaine d at a lower level compared to other 
regional countries  
 Exports of regional countries and Thailand contracted sharply in the second quarter of 
2020 . In May, Thai exports shrank by 23 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 (Chart 1,  
shaded blue ). While Thai exports had already recovered by around 50 percent from the 
bottom and registered a 12 percent contraction in July compared to the fourth quarter 
of 2020 . Moreover, they remained much lower than the pre -pandemic level compared to 
most countries in the region . 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The structure of Thai exports was concentrated in the product segments and the markets 
that face a slow recovery  
 Thai exports faced a slower recovery compared to other  regional  countries, due to the 
following reasons (1) the product composition of Thai  exports consisted of a relatively 
larger share of slow recovery products such as automotive, machineries and equipment 
compared to other countries in  the region . (Chart 2, shaded red ). As they were high -value 
products, their dem and declined in line with a collapse in global demand because of the COVID -19 
pandemic . Exports of automotive contracted by 21 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 
2019 – worse than other product categories and regional countries  (Chart 3 )8 /. Meanwhile, 
                                                             
8/ Calculated from the average value of exports during January and July 2020, compared to the fourth quarter of 
2019 . This should cover the periods when each product category was impacted and exhibited different recovery 
patterns . Thai exports of automotive registered the second highest level of contraction among 6 countries .

countries,  particularly electronics and electrical appliances (Chart 2, shaded green ) whose 
demand surged during the transition period into new -normal environment . Thai exports in this 
category  contracted by only 5 percent (Chart 3 ), which was lower than other categories . 
Overall, however, Thailand did not benefit much from the recovery of electronics and electrical 
appliances . 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(2) For the market composition, 
a share of Thai exports to ASEAN was 
rather larger while share of those to China  
was smaller  compared to other regional  
countries  (Chart 4 ). ASEAN countries  
were affected by strict containment 
measure,  imposing in some countries 
and slow recovery of global trade and 
tourism sector as they had high reliance 
on external demand . Meanwhile, domestic  
demand in China recovered fast and their 
purchasing power remained solid owing 
to a relaxation of containment measures 
and the stimulus measures . As a result, Thailand benefited less from the recovering Chinese 
economy compared to regional countries . 
Thailand’s declining participation in the global supply chain  
 Another reason why Thai exports recovered more slowly than other regional 
countries was because Thailand ’s competitiveness lagged behind our competitors, as 
reflected in declining level of particip ation in the global value chain in many industries . 
This was in the opposite direction to our key competitors, particularly Vietnam  which 
received an average of 15 billion U .S. dollars per year in foreign direct investment (FDI) during 
the past 10 years (average 7 .2 percent of GDP ), and the trend is increasing . Meanwhile, 
Thailand received an average of 3 .6 billion U .S. dollars per year in FDI (average 0 .9 percent 
of GDP ). This partly explained why Vietnam ’s value of exports surpassed that of Thailand for 
the first time in 2019 . 
 Such trend reflected the fact that Vietnam was a more attractive investment 
destination than Thailand in many ways  (Chart 5 ), namely its market size and growth 
Chart 2 The product composition of Thai exports consisted of a relatively 
larger share of slow recovery products such as automotive, machineries 
and equipment and a relatively smaller share of electronics compared to 
other countries in the region.

Monetary Policy Report  September 2020                                                                                                                      35  potential, labor costs, quality of labor, political stability9 /, and the level of ICT adoption10 /. 
Moreover, Vietnam signed free trade agreements (FTA)11/ with three times as many countries 
as Thailand did, resulting in Vietnamese firms having a competitive advantage over Thai firms . 
This was because they can export to several countries at almost zero tariff due to the 
relaxation or exemption of imports tariffs (Chart 6 ). Moreover, Vietnam can take advantage of 
the rules of origin12/, owing to their participation in multi -lateral FTA wh ich resulted in more 
products being qualified for tax purposes according to the FTA . 
 The fact that Thailand remained lagged behind regional countries in terms of 
international trade agreements and technology adoption posed significant risk to its 
participation in the global supply chain . Multinational companies were currently in the 
process of selecting their production base or adjusting their supply chain to suit the post -COVID 
environment . The trend of regionalization has become more apparent, as  well as the use of 
technology to increase resilience in cross -country production allocation in order to prevent 
supply chain disruptions that could arise due to uncertainties in the future . 
 In summary, the recovery of Thai exports remained slow and at a lower level than 
regional countries, with the risk of declining participation in the global supply chain in the long 
term. Boosting the competitiveness of Thai exports was therefore of critical importance 
at this juncture, both by expediting the negotiatio ns of trade agreements, especially the 
multilateral agreements, improving necessary infrastructure, and ensuring technology 
adoption particularly for SMEs . Moreover, both business models and products should 
be adjusted to suit the post -COVID environment, i n order to increase participation in 
the global supply chain and enhance competitiveness of Thai exports sector in the future .

12/ Rules of origin referred to the nationality of the product based on its origin of production, and calculated from 
the value add which was gene rated from that origin . Therefore, multilateral agreements were favorable as they 
allowed for the accumulation of such value add among member countries – resulting in higher benefits from the 
relaxation or exemption of tariffs than bilateral agreements .   
Monetary Policy Report  September 2020                                                                                                                      36  New Loan Rate :  the real costs of borrowing for businesses  
The Bank of Thailand (BOT ) has been monitoring the transmission of the policy 
rate cut, as well as financial measures implemented by the public sector on costs of 
borrowing in various markets, particularly credit market, which is major external sources of 
funds for the Thai business es. However, monitoring costs of borrowing by looking at the 
reference loan rates announced by commercial banks, including minimum loan rate (MLR ), 
may not reflect the real costs of borrowing faced by businesses when they request for new 
loans . This is as costs of borrowing vary with risk of businesses, loan duration, or loan type .  
The BOT therefore developed data on new loan rates (NLR) for businesses, by 
calculating the actual loan rates charged by commercial banks weighted by contract size 
requested by businesses for new loans . The data suggest that first, the actual costs of 
borrowing for businesses were, on average, lower than reference loan rates announced 
by commercial banks . Second, change in the policy rate highly transmitted to NLR for  
businesses  by 87 percent compared with 35 percent transmission to MLR (Chart 1 ). Third, 
actual costs of new borrowing for businesses continued to decline across all contract 
sizes . This was consistent with the policy rate cuts from 1 .75 percent since mid -2019 to 0 .50 
percent since May 20, 2020, the historically lowest level, and the announcement to cut the 
contribution to Financial Institutions Development Fund (FIDF ) from 0 .46 to 0 .23 percent of 
the deposit base for two years until end of 2021 . Fourth, NLR for  businesses with contract 
size less than 100 million baht clearly declined following the implementation of 
government soft loan program, reflecting the effectiveness of government credit relief 
measures in reducing costs of new borrowing for  businesses . (Chart 2)   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In conclusion, NLR for businesses reflected the actual costs of new borrowing, which 
is thus a good indicator to monitor financial conditions . The BOT has published data on NLR 
for businesses by contract amount13 / to provide businesses w ith additional information to 
support decision -making when applying for new loans in addition to considering reference loan 
rates currently published by commercial banks .

Monetary Policy Report  September 2020                                                                                                                      37 3. Monetary Policy  Decision  
The MPC maintained the policy rate at 0 .50 percent and viewed that a further decrease in 
the policy rate would be not be highly effective . Instead, the Committee deemed it necessary 
to enhance the effectiveness of the  financial and credit measures of the government . 
At the meetings on August 5 and September 23, 2020, the Committee voted 
unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 0 .50 percent . The Committee assessed that 
the Thai economy was expected to gradually recover in line with the relaxation of COVID -19 
containment measures both in Thailan d and abroad . However, the Thai economic recovery 
would take at least two years before returning to the pre -pandemic level . Moreover, it remained 
subject to the risk of the second wave of the outbreak, which further  weighed on the stability 
of the financia l system . Headline inflation was projected to be less negative in 2020 than 
previously assessed and would gradually rise toward a level close to the lower bound of the 
target in 2021 . The Committee viewed that the extra accommodative monetary policy since 
the beginning of the year as well as fiscal, financial, and credit measures additionally 
announced helped alleviate adverse impacts, and would support the economic recovery after 
the pandemic subsided, facilitate the return of inflation toward the target  and reduce financial 
stability risks . In addition, a further decrease in the policy rate would be less effective in the 
current context and could increase vulnerabilities in the financial system . The Committee 
therefore agreed to preserve the limited policy  space for the appropriate and most effective 
timing . Besides, the Committee deemed it necessary to encourage financial institutions to 
expedite debt restructuring for households and businesses to have widespread impacts and 
accelerate lending under variou s measures to address liquidity problems in a targeted and 
timely manner consistent with business restructuring . 
In determining the appropriate course of monetary policy, details on the key assessment 
are as follows . 
The Thai economic recovery would take at least two years before returning to the pre -
pandemic level . The recovery would be highly uncertain due to both domestic and external 
factors, and therefore could weigh  on the stability of the financial system . 
The Thai economy was expected to gradually  recover in line with the relaxation 
of COVID -19 containment measures both in Thailand and abroad, while  the Thai 
financial system remained highly vulnerable . Moreover, the recovery would take at least 
two years before returning to the pre -pandemic level,  partly due to the structural 
constraints of  Thai export sector,  namely (1) Thai exports  comprised a large share of 
automotive, machineries and equipment which were sensitive to a decline in global purchasing 
power . Meanwhile, the proportion of electronic p roducts that recovered quickly due to higher 
demand for technology products  during the transition period into a new way of life,  was low, 
and (2) the export destinations were concentrated in countries which experienced a slow 
recovery, for example ASEAN ec onomies . Moreover, the competitiveness of Thai exports has 
declined as Thailand signed fewer  trade agreements than the competitors (BOX : The post -
COVID -19 recovery of Thai exports under structural  constraints  in Chapter 2 ) 
The Thai economic recovery would remain highly uncertain, owing to  (1) a 
possible delay in the recovery of the tourism sector , if there was the second wave of the  
Monetary Policy Report  September 2020                                                                                                                      38 outbreak in many countries including Thailand . This would erode the confidence and 
discourage international travel . Moreover,  there were uncertainties regarding the re -opening 
policy of the country to foreign tourists, and (2) the continuity of the economic recovery of 
Thailand ’s trading partners  could be interrupted after the fiscal support gradually phased 
out and the effect of  pent-up demand dissipated . Moreover, the second wave of the outbreak 
could lead to more stringent containment measures, while the global financial system 
remained vulnerable as a result of rising default risks of corporate bonds or credit rating 
downgrades of government bonds . Overall, these  factors could increase vulnerabilities in 
the financial system  and weigh on financial positions of households and businesses, as well as 
their debt servicing abilities . 
The recovery would be greatly uneven amo ng economic sectors, regions, and firms in 
different segments . Government policies should therefore be continuous and implemented 
in a targeted and timely manner to facilitate appropriate adjustments . At the same time, 
measures should also be coherent and consistent among government agencies . 
The Committee viewed that the Thai economic recovery would be uneven in several 
dimensions, for example (1) economic sectors : firms in the service sector and tourism -
related sector would not fully recover as they were highly reliant on external demand, 
compared to domestic -oriented sectors which would recover more quickly (2) area-based : for 
instance, hotels  located in the provinces near Bangkok would be able to attract more tourists 
than provinces further away and (3) size of firms : firms within the same sector would recover 
at a different pace, for example, medium and large hotels were more likely to benefit from the 
government ’s measure to promote tourism, as they were equipped with more facilities and 
varieties of ac tivities, and therefore were more attractive to domestic tourists . Government 
therefore should implement measures in a continuous, targeted, and timely manner to facilitate 
appropriate transition into the post -COVID environment . At the same time, measures should 
also be coherent and consistent among government agencies . 
Going forward, fiscal and supply -side policies  should be given a greater role in 
order to address excess production capacity , as well as support the changing economic 
structure, patterns of business operations, and labor skill development consistent with the 
post-COVID environment . Moreover, government agencies should collaborate to push through  
additional supply -side measures in order to revive the economy . In particular, the re-opening 
of the country to foreign tourists would have important implications on the recovery path, and 
therefore the government should  consider appropriate policy trade -off, considering both the 
economic and healthcare dimensions . Meanwhile, the continued accommodati ve monetary 
policy  would complement fiscal policy through low costs of borrowing and ample liquidity in 
the financial markets . 
Going forward, financial and credit measures by the government should focus 
on (1) ensuring that liquidity  was distributed to businesses and households in a broad -based  
manner , by accelerate lending under various measures to address liquidity problems in a  
targeted and timely manner consistent with business restructuring . Meanwhile, the government  
has revised the credit measures previously announced to make them more targeted and also 
announced additional credit guarantee measures to enhance the effectiveness of the BOT soft 
loan program, (2) encouraging financial institutions to expedite debt restructuring for 
retail borrowers and SMEs , to be consistent with their income streams and debt serviceabilities   
Monetary Policy Report  September 2020                                                                                                                      39 in the post -COVID environment . Recently, the BOT had launched the DR BIZ program as well 
as additional measures for retail borrowers, namely the debt consolidation measure in or der 
to assist both businesses and households that had potential but were affected by the economic 
conditions and had multiple creditors and many debt categories (BOX : Additional financial and 
credit measures by the government ), and (3) Increasing operating  cashflows and loan 
access for SMEs , for example, by setting a standard credit term that allowed SMEs to receive 
faster payments from their counterparties . Moreover, digital lending and digital factoring should 
be encouraged to provide households and SMEs which cannot access loans  from financial 
institutions an easier access to liquidity .  
The Committee expressed concerns over highly fragile labor markets and viewed that 
labor policies in the period ahead should be more targeted and take into account differ ences 
within each economic sector, variations in recovery  as well as obstacles to adjustments in 
each area .  
The Committee viewed that although the labor market has improved following 
the relaxation of containment measures, the outlook remained fragile bot h in terms of 
employment and income . Following the relaxation of containment measures, some businesses  
rehired their workers at a lower wage . However, a slow recovery in the exports of goods and 
services continued to weigh on the overall employment, leading some workers to seek jobs in 
the agricultural sector and become self -employed in the non -farm sector with lower wages . 
Going forward, the labor market would remain vulnerable due to (1) the impacts of COVID -19 
which could be prolonged and lead to c ontinued wage reduction and more widespread lay -off 
particularly in the services sector (2) the effects of the government measures regarding income 
support and economic recovery would gradually wane by the end of the year, leading to the 
fragile labor mark et (3) the agricultural sector would not be able to absorb a large number of 
workers during the first half of 2021 which was off the planting season, and (4) some workers 
would face difficulties in returning to the labor market even after the pandemic  subs ided, 
especially those in recently -graduated, old -aged, and unskilled groups . This was because 
businesses had high level of excess capacity and thus adjusted by increasingly adopting 
digital technology and automation in the production process . This would r esult in economic 
scars on the long -term potential economic growth . Therefore, labor policies in the period 
ahead will be very important and should be more targeted, as well as taking into 
account the differences in each economic sector and area with diffe rent obstacles to 
recovery . Meanwhile, the government should also implement labor skill development policy 
in order to create employment in target industries, adjust to the post -COVID environment, and 
support firms in retaining employment (BOX : Investigating Thai labor market …how well it 
recovered after the city re -opening? ) 
The Committee would stand ready to use additional appropriate policy tools if necessary . 
Looking ahead, the Committee would monitor developments of economic growth, 
inflation , and financial stability, together with associated risks, including external risks, the 
impacts of the COVID -19 pandemic, and the effectiveness of fiscal, financial, and credit 
measures, as well as the baht situation which might affect the economic recovery in deliberating 
monetary policy going forward . The Committee would stand ready to use additio nal appropriate 
policy tools if necessary .

Headline inflation was less negative compared to the second quarter as a result of a gradual 
increase in energy prices  coupled with the increases in fresh food prices, particularly meat  
and vegetable . Core inflation edged up after the expiration of the government ’s measure to 
ease the burden on water bills, while demand also improved following the  relaxation of 
containment measures . Regarding inflation expectation, short -term inflation expectations 
declined slightly while long -term expectations remained within the monetary policy target .

household debt -to-GDP ratio which rose from 80 .2 percent in the first quarter to 83 .8 percent 
in the second quarter of 2020, as well as high levels of NPL . However, proactive debt 
restructuring would help  mitigate  the deterioration in credit quality .

The supply of real estate declined both low -rise residences and condominiums, in line with a 
decline in property demand . However, the real estate market faced the risk of high excess 
supply of condominiums and a longer time -to-go period, especially for condominium  with 
prices below five million baht .

The financial position of financial institutions remained robust, as reflected by adequately high 
levels of commercial banks ’ reserves and capital buffers to cushion against risks of credit 
quality deterioration . Nevertheless, overall NPL ratios in the commercial banking system 
increased slightly in the second quarter of 2020, in line with economic conditions . 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Stability : External positions  
Thailand ’s external stability remained solid, as reflected in the high level of international 
reserves and the low level of external debt to GDP ratio compared to international benchmark . 
This would help the Thai economy stay resilient against volatilities in the global financial 
markets .

Fiscal stability remained sound, as reflected in the ratio of public debt to GDP that remained 
below the fiscal sustainability threshold . However, public de bt to GDP has been increasing 
since the second quarter of 2020 due to additional borrowing in order to implement measures 
to remedy and restore the economy after the COVID -19 pandemic, as well as to reduce fiscal deficit .
