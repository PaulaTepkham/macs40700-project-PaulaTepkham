4/53Executive Summary
some goods such as electronics and petrochemical products would recover more slowly 
than others due to idiosyncratic factors (Box2:Outlook for Thai exports ).On the whole, 
there are possibilities that the Thai economy would register stronger growth than 
assessed with the upside risks mainly attributed by a more -than-expected rebound in 
foreign tourist arrivals and tourism spending. Nevertheless, there remains the need to 
closely monitor downside risks stemming from the uncertainties in global economy and 
financial markets. 
Inflation
Headline inflation is expected to fall within the target range in Q2/2023, 
averaging at 2.9% in 2023 and 2.4% in 2024. It is expected that supply -side pressures 
would gradually dissipate as domestic electricity costs and diesel prices decline. Core 
inflation has declined slightly but would remain stable at high levels for some 
time, averaging at 2.4% in 2023 and 2.0% in 2024. This is in line with recent declines in 
underlying inflation indicators, while prices in the core CPI mostly remain high or have 
increased. Medium -term inflation expectations are still well -anchored within the 
target range. 
The inflation outlook is subject to upside risks from (1) potentially higher 
cost passthrough from producers as they continue to face high costs and have yet to 
pass on some of those costs to the consumers, and (2) higher demand -pull inflationary 
pressure from the stronger -than-expected recovery in tourism. As such, it is still necessary
to closely monitor risks to inflation going forward. Global economy
Trading partners are expected to grow 2.5% in 2023 and 2.9% in 2024. The 
outlook for US and euro area economies have improved on the back of growth 
momentum in the services sector. The Chinese economy posted strong gains since 
COVID containment measures have been lifted, resulting in a recovery in economic 
activities in both the manufacturing and services sectors. Overall, the improvement in 
global economic outlook and China's reopening are expected to support Asia’s 
economic recovery in the period ahead. However, the global economic outlook faces 
greater uncertainties due to persistently high global inflation, and tighter financial 
conditions following banking stresses in advanced economies, which would have 
implications for monetary policy directions and the global economy going forward .
The Thai Economy
The Thai economy is expected to continue expanding, growing 3.6% in 
2023 and 3.8% in 2024. Growth would be driven by (1) a strong recovery in 
tourism as reflected by an increase in foreign tourist arrivals across almost all nationalities,
especially the Chinese. It is expected that foreign tourist arrivals would reach 28.0 and 
35.0 million in 2023 and 2024, respectively ( Box1:Recovery outlook for foreign 
tourist arrivals) ; (2)a continued recovery in private consumption supported by the 
recovery in economic activities as well as more broad -based improvements in 
employment and labor income, especially for those in the services sectors and the 
self-employed; and (3) a stronger recovery in merchandise exports expected for 
the second half of the year in line with trading partners’ growth. However, exports of
5/53Executive Summary
Financial Conditions and Financial Stability
Thailand’s overall financial conditions remain accommodative. Financial conditions 
have tightened somewhat consistent with the gradual policy normalization. Commercial banks’ 
interest rates and short -term bond yields have increased, in line with the higher policy rate. Long -
term bond yields have declined slightly from the previous quarter, moving in tandem with US 
Treasury yields as the market expects a slower policy rate hike by the Fed following recent 
banking stresses. Nonetheless, the increased financing costs have not impeded private sector 
financing yet as reflected by a continued growth in private credit and bond issuance in Thailand. 
Moreover, it is also expected that private sector financing would continue to expand as the Thai 
economy recovers. On exchange rates, the baht against the US dollar appreciated from the 
previous quarter. The baht’s appreciation during the early parts of the quarter was due to the 
reopening of the Chinese economy which benefits Thai tourism.  This was followed by the baht’s 
fluctuation against the US dollar, which was driven by market expectations about the Fed’s 
monetary policy.
Financial stability remained sound overall. Recent banking stresses in some advanced 
economies have not had a significant impact on the Thai financial system, as Thai financial institutions
and corporations have limited linkages with the troubled banks and risky assets. Moreover, 
financial institutions maintain high levels of capital. However, as the situation remains fluid and 
uncertain, there is a need to closely monitor the developments and continuously assess potential 
impacts on Thailand’s financial stability. 
As for households and businesses, the ongoing economic recovery has improved debt 
serviceability. Financial fragilities nonetheless remain for some SMEs and certain households exposed
to rising living costs and higher debt burden. The MPC deems that debt restructuring should be 
continually implemented and should expand the scope to cover more vulnerable groups in order 
to address household debt problems in a well targeted and sustainable manner. Monetary Policy Decision in the First Quarter of 2023
At the meetings on 25 January 2023 and 29 March 2023, the MPC voted unanimously 
to raise the policy rate by 0.25 percentage point from 1.25% to 1.50% and from 1.50% to 
1.75%, respectively. The MPC views that monetary policy normalization is still appropriate given 
the current economic and inflation outlook. The MPC assesses that the Thai economy would 
continue to expand driven primarily by tourism and private consumption. Meanwhile, merchandise
exports have started to recover from the contraction earlier and would see a stronger rebound in 
the second half of the year. Headline inflation is expected to return to the target range within 
Q2/2023 albeit with upside risks from potentially higher cost passthrough as businesses continue 
to face high input costs, and rising demand -pull inflationary pressure from the ongoing economic 
recovery. Financial stability remains sound overall but there is still the need to monitor global 
financial market developments including banking stresses in advanced economies, which could 
impact both the Thai financial system and the Thai economy. With regard to vulnerable SMEs and 
households, the MPC sees the need to continue implementing debt restructuring measures with an 
emphasis on rolling out measures that would address debt problems of the vulnerable groups in a 
well targeted and sustainable manner. 
Under the monetary policy framework with objectives of maintaining price stability, supporting
sustainable and full -potential economic growth, and preserving financial stability, the MPC assesses 
that the Thai economy would continue to recover but there are risks stemming from rising 
demand -pull inflationary pressure that must be monitored going forward. Hence, the MPC judges 
that policy rate should be normalized in a gradual and measured manner to a level that is 
consistent with sustainable growth in the long term. The MPC also stands ready to adjust the 
size and timing of policy normalization should the growth and inflation outlook shifts from 
the current assessments.

Inflation in many economies would likely 
remain high for longer 
than expected, causing many 
central banks continuing to 
tighten monetary policy.Global Economy: Key Issues
The global economy would continue to recover 
driven by the services sector, especially in the 
US, euro area, and China. Meanwhile, Asian 
economies would benefit from China's 
reopening and improvements in 
manufacturing activities globally in H2/2023.Trading partners’ growth outlook faces 
downside risks from an elevated inflation 
outlook, banking stresses in advanced 
economies, and 
prolonged geopolitical tensions.

Theglobal economy isexpected toregister stronger growth in2023 ontheback ofgrowth momentum intheservices
sector andChina's reopening .Meanwhile, themanufacturing activities inmany countries have slowed down intandem
withtherecent decline indemand forgoods, butwould likely topickup inH2/2023.
The services sector is expected to see a strong recovery, especially in China following the economy’s re -opening and the COVID -19 outbreak having 
subsided. Meanwhile, the manufacturing sector in many countries has slowed down in H2/2022 partly due to a slowdown in demand for durab le and semi -
durable goods that have accelerated the year prior. However, it is expected that goods demand and manufacturing activities worldwide would gradually 
improve in H2/2023. This is partly thanks to the reopening of the Chinese economy as reflected in PMI improvements for China and Asia.  354045505560657075

the reversal of Zero -COVID policy. Since the COVID -19 outbreak has subsided , 
consumer confidence has improved and economic activities have continued to 
recover in both the manufacturing and services sectors. The situation in real

9/53Global economy
Exports of both electronics and non -electronics goods have declined in the second half of 2022. This was partly due to demand being weighed down by high 
inflation as well as China ’s economic slowdown from Zero -COVID policy and problems in the China ’s real estate sector prior to China ’s policy pivot. However, Asian 
merchandise exports are expected to improve after the reopening of the Chinese economy. It is expected that exports of electronics goods used in factories, 
personal computers, smartphones, and consumer products would pass their lowest points in 2023 before gradually recovering in tandem with global demand and 
inventory rundowns. Asian merchandise exports have declined over the recent period, both exports of electronics and non -electronics 
goods. However, Asian economies would benefit from the China’s reopening and improvements in manufacturing 
activities globally this year.

2023Banking stress in advanced economies impeded confidence among domestic depositors and investors but the situation 
has eased following responses from the regulators.Banking stresses in the US and Europe impeded confidence among depositors. 
Many depositors withdrew money from problematic banks and either deposited them 
with larger banks or invested in money market funds. Financial market vulnerability 
remains, especially among the banking sector as reflected by high CDS spreads for 
banks abroad. 
The situation has eased following a swift response from the regulators. US regulators
seized control of 3 problematic banks and implemented the Bank Term Funding Program
(BTFP) to provide liquidity to commercial banks. Swiss regulators also approved the merger
of two large banks and provided additional liquidity to commercial banks. Overall 
financial conditions have tightened but to a lesser extent compared to previous 
crises as reflected in the National Financial Conditions Index (NFCI).

Inflation expectation at end 2023 (current) Inflation expectation at end 2023 (Jan)Most central banks are still pursuing monetary tightening given that inflation remains elevated and is likely to be

The Federal Reserve (Fed)raised its policy rate by 25 bps to 4.75 -5.00% at the 
FOMC meeting on 22 March 2023. The decision was underpinned by strong labor 
market conditions and rising inflation. Looking ahead, the Fed still gives weight to 
inflation risks and stands ready to utilize other tools to support the US banking 
system so that it could effectively tighten monetary policy until inflation returns to 
the 2% target. In this regard, the BOT has revised up its federal funds rate 
projection by 25 bps throughout the forecast period. 
The European Central Bank (ECB) raised its policy rate by 50 bps to 3.0% at the 
Governing Council Meeting on 16 March 2023. The decision was underpinned by 
elevated inflationary pressure. Looking ahead, the ECB is likely to continue raising 
the policy rate with a more data -dependent approach. The ECB also emphasized 
its readiness to deploy new tools to support commercial banks should liquidity 
problems arise in the European financial system. 
Most Asian central banks continued to raise their policy rates as core inflation 
remained high for longer than expected. However, some central banks such as 
Bank Negara Malaysia, Bank Indonesia, and Bank of Korea have temporarily halted 
their policy rate hikes to evaluate the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission
from the recent hikes. Headline inflation Core inflation and Inflation expectation

Trading partners’ growth in 2022 was largely in line the previous assessment, while the forecast for 2023 is revised up slightly on account of the 
gradual demand recovery in advanced economies and China. For 2024, trading partners’ growth is projected to slow down slightly due to the 
impact of high inflation and monetary policy transmission. 
Trading partners’ growth forecast for 2023 is revised up slightly . The US and the euro area are 
projected to post a stronger economic recovery as reflected by Q4/2022 growth outturns as well as 
ongoing improvements seen in most recent economic indicators. China’s economic growth also 
improved following the country’s re -opening. Meanwhile, the Japanese economy has slowed down as 
exports outlook worsened. 
Trading partners’ growth forecast for 2024 is revised down on account of elevated inflation and 
tighter financial conditions. 
Overall, risks of trading partners’ growth outlook skewed to the downside: details are below
Downside risks :(1)Slower -than-expected global economic recovery due to high inflation, 
tighter financial conditions from monetary policy transmission, and sharper -than-expected 
decline in global trade; (2) Impacts of financial stability risks on global economy such as 
banking stresses in advanced economies; and (3) Geopolitical tensions especially between 
US-China that could escalate further due to the Tech War and China’s invasion of US airspace, 
as well as the prolonged China -Taiwan and the Russia -Ukraine conflicts.
Upside risks: Stronger -than-expected growth among Asian economies due to (1) strong 
recovery in the services sector thanks to the resumption in international travel, especially tourist 
arrivals from China; and ( 2) stronger -than-expected economic growth in China boosting Asian 
exports.Assumptions of Trading Partners’ Growth

Foreign

across almost all nationalities. The number of Chinese tourists has accelerated after COVID -19 outbreak in China subsided as well as the 
lifting of travel restrictions in China and India. Foreign tourist arrivals would continue to recover in 2024 with projected number of 
foreign tourists being revised up from 31.5 million to 35.0 million persons mainly on account of Russian and Chinese tourists . 
(Box1:Recovery outlook for foreign tourist arrivals)
Private 
consumptionRevised up on account of the recovery in tourism, which would also benefit employment and labor income, especially among
low-income households. Private consumption would continue to expand in 2024 as household purchasing power improves with 
the recovery in labor income and declining inflation.
Merchandise 
exports (value)Merchandise exports would register a slight contraction in 2023 mainly because of a decline in exports volume . It is expected 
that merchandise exports would recover in the latter half of the year. Exports of automobile and electronical appliances woul d 
recover in tandem with trading partners’ growth and as shortage of electronics component is resolved. Exports of agricultural and 
agro-manufacturing goods would continue to expand in tandem with China’s reopening and the economic recovery in Asia. 
Nevertheless, exports of hard disk drives (HDD) and petrochemical products would continue to decline due to industry -specific 
factors. Merchandise exports would continue to expand in 2024.  
Private 
investmentRevised down on account of short -term factors such as the contraction in exports and some public private partnership (PPP) 
projects being delayed. Private investment is expected to pick up and post strong growth rates in 2024 partly due to investments
in new target industries such as EV and BCG seen by an increase in investment approvals by BOI for large corporates.  Summary of economic forecasts
16/53The Thai Economy
Box 1: Recovery outlook for foreign tourist arrivals
Tourism has resumed its role as a major growth driver for the Thai economy 
since H2/2022 when the COVID -19 outbreak subsided and various countries 
including Thailand gradually lifted international travel restrictions. It is now more 
evident that Thai tourism is heading towards pre -COVID levels of 40 million foreign 
tourists and tourism income of 1.9 trillion baht (11% of GDP). This is reflected in 
demand -side indicators such as foreign tourist arrivals in March 2023 of approximately 
71,000 persons per day (63% of 2019) as well as supply -side indicators such as seat 
capacity of international flights to Thailand and hotel reservations which have continued 
to recover (Chart 1) .
Foreign tourist arrivals is estimated to reach 28 million persons in 2023 and 
35 million persons in 2024. This is an upward revision to the previous forecast in the 
Monetary Policy Report Q4/2022 of 22 million persons in 2023 and 31.5 million persons 
in 2024 (Chart 2) . There are 2 major factors underpinning this revision:
(1) Sooner -than-expected reopening of the Chinese economy. The Chinese 
economy has re -opened since 8 January 2023 and allowed group tours to Thailand 
since 6 February 2023, both of which took place much sooner than previously expected 
at late 2023. As such, it is expected that the number of Chinese tourists traveling to 
Thailand would be 5.5 million in 2023 and 9.5 million in 2024, an upward revision from 
the previous Monetary Policy Report of 1.8 million in 2023 and 6.3 million in 2024.

country reopened, the recovery so far has met with supply -side constraints namely the 
limited number of flights. However, it is expected that this problem would likely to be 
resolved by next year. 
(2) Speed of recovery of foreign tourist arrivals has been faster than expected
(Chart 3). Preliminary figures for foreign tourist arrivals in March 2023 (excluding those 
from China) indicate a recovery of 78% of the level seen in 2019. This recovery is higher 
than expected for almost all nationalities especially Russia, South Korea, Hong Kong, 
Taiwan, Malaysia, and also India which rebounded since the RT -PCR test requirement for 
those returning from Thailand has been lifted on 13 February 2023. It is also expected 
that increased global tourism demand would support foreign tourist arrivals to 
Thailand to continuously increase and reach pre -COVID levels by 2025.
However, the recovery outlook is subject to risks that could impair foreign 
tourist arrivals namely: 
(1) Supply -side limitations on part of the airports and airlines. A key bottleneck
is the lack of ground staffs in Thai airports, especially positions that are required to do 
manual labor which is not popular among Thai workers. At the same time, these 
positions cannot be filled by immigrant workers because airports must maintain 
high levels of security, which requires airport staffs to undergo prior training in 
accordance with international standards. This limitation presents a loss opportunity for 
Thailand in receiving more foreign travelers and an obstacle to airlines that wants to 
increase the number of flights if they do not have sufficient ground staffs, especially 20222023 2024

considering that China has just re -opened and likely to open up more flights. This 
problem would be more severe for Chinese airlines compared to other countries’ 
airlines whose flight arrangements have already been scheduled.  
(2) Supply -side constraints on part of tourism -related businesses especially 
hotels which faced widespread labor shortage after having reduced hiring during the 
COVID -19 pandemic. While labor shortage might not be a direct obstacle to the recovery 
in tourism because it could be addressed by hiring labor from other sectors or immigrant
workers, such a solution could have indirect impacts through perception about Thai 
tourism as the quality of service might worsen. This is reflected in the Hotel business 
operator Sentiment Index (HSI)survey that most responses deemed that labor shortage 
would mainly impact the quality of services (Chart 4) .
Moreover, there remains the need to monitor the recovery pattern of 
foreign tourist arrivals in the period ahead which would have implications for 
uneven recovery in tourism income in some locations. The share of tourists will 
switch from long-haul group , such as those from Europe and the US with the tendency 
to stay longer, have higher spending and typically be the first group to recover, to 
short-haul group , such as those from Malaysia, Vietnam, South Korea, and also Chinese 
tourists going forward. Furthermore, these short -haul tourists usually stay in Thailand 
for a shorter period and spend less. Therefore, tourism income might not increase 
as much as the increase in the number of foreign tourists. However, tourism in provinces 0510152025

along the border would continue to benefit from short -haul tourists from neighboring 
countries, which would help disperse tourism income across different locations. 
In summary, foreign tourists arrivals would continue to increase in tandem with 
global tourism demand and it is expected to return to pre -COVID levels by 2025. 
However, there remains the need to monitor factors that could impact the return of foreign 
tourists such as the shortage of ground staffs at Thai airports which could limit the increase 
in the number of flights to Thailand as well as labor shortages faced by hotels that could 
impact the quality of service. If these supply -side constraints could be overcome, tourism 
would be able to fully recover and realize its full potential as one of the key drivers of 
growth for the Thai economy. Chart 4: Hotel business operator Sentiment Index (HSI) survey

•Merchandise exports outturns in Q4/2022 was lower than expected. This 
was mainly due to a slowdown in demand from trading partners resulting 
in broad -based decline in export quantity across many goods such as 
petroleum -related products, electrical appliances, electronics, metals, and 
processed agricultural products. 
•Looking ahead, export quantity is expected to recover in tandem with 
global demand, passing its lowest point in H1/2023. However, the pickup in 
global demand might have limited benefits for Thai exports because growth 
among trading partners would be driven by the services sector and China 
would also shift away from importing goods to focus more on manufacturing 
for domestic consumption. (Box2: Outlook for Thai exports )
•Export prices would likely be higher than previously expected due to 
elevated prices of energy and other goods. Merchandise exports are expected to recover in the period ahead but the global economic outlook remains uncertain 
and must be monitored.

Box 2: Outlook for Thai exports
Given the improved global economic outlook and China’s re -opening, it is 
expected that Thai merchandise exports would pass its trough in H1/2023 and 
resume positive growth in 2024. However, it is also unlikely that the recovery would 
be V-shaped. This is because economic growth in most trading partners would be 
driven by services rather than merchandise trade and China’s dual circulation policy 
that shifted its economy away from importing goods to focus more on manufacturing for 
domestic consumption. A product -level assessment using Constant Market Share 
Analysis1/(CMSA) indicated that there are idiosyncratic shifts in the export structure 
of some product categories that could further weigh on Thai export performance 
going forward.  
(1) Exports of petrochemical products would recover in tandem with trading 
partners’ demand but the recovery would be limited by competitiveness issues 
and lower import demand from China . The CMSA analysis showed that while the 
export structure of Thai petrochemical products has been determined by trading 
partners’ demand or the “market effect” , however, for the past 5 years, its market 
share growth have slowed as reflected by a negative “competitiveness effect” 
(Chart 1.1). Thai petrochemical exports have lost its competitive edge to Europe 
and China, partly due to higher input costs. As such, it is expected that exports of 
petrochemical products would be weighed down by competitiveness issues even 
If businesses have adapted by focusing more on making specialized products anddiversifying its exports to ASEAN markets as reflected by an increase in “market 
adaptation effect”. A closer look at exports of petrochemical products to China, 
which is among Thailand’s most important export markets, the aforementioned 
competitiveness effect is further compounded by slowing import demand from China 
as reflected by a negative “product effect” . This is a result of China’s dual circulation 
policy whereby the Chinese government has encouraged increasing manufacturing 
capacity for domestic consumption, which is also likely to remain in effect for some 
time. The dual circulation policy would thus limit the spillover benefits from China’s 
re-opening on Thai petrochemical exports.

Box 2: Outlook for Thai exports
(2)Exports of electronics is expected to recover more slowly compared to 
other exports given that the global electronics cycle is still in the downcycle (lasts 
about 12 months on average) after having benefited from accelerated purchases and 
inventory accumulation during the COVID -19 pandemic as a result of work from home 
arrangements (Chart 2) . It is expected that demand for electronics goods would decline in 
the first half of 2023 before picking up in the latter half of the year in tandem with the 
economic recovery of trading partners. Exports of electronics would remain affected by 
structural factors related to hard disk drives (HDD). CMSA results (Chart 1.2) showed 
that market share growth of HDD has slowed down significantly compared to 2016, especially
in the US market. Technological advancements have resulted in a significant decline in 
demand for consumer HDDs as they have been replaced by solid state drives (SSDs) 
reflected from negative adaptation effect and competitiveness effect during the post -COVID 
outbreak period. However, there are still demand for high capacity enterprise HDDs 
from cloud and data center businesses . Hence, there still exist opportunities for Thailand 
to adapt and maintain its market share for HDD in the global market. 
Other export goods areexpected togrow inlinewiththeeconomic recovery
oftrading partners ,especially exports ofautomobile andelectrical appliances which are
highly correlated withtradingpartners’ growth andhave seen improvements since the
semi-conductor shortage subsided .Meanwhile, exports ofagricultural andagro-manufacturing
products areexpected tobecome amajor driver ofexports growth intheperiod ahead .Chart 2: Electronic Cycle

Box 2: Outlook for Thai exports
Exports of agricultural and agro -manufacturing products would continue to expand on 
the back of China’s re -opening and Asia’s economic recovery, especially in the tourism 
sectors. 
Looking ahead, competitiveness of Thai exports has to be closely monitored . 
This is particularly the case for agricultural and agro -manufacturing products that are 
highly at risk of losing competitiveness in the ASEAN market as reflected by CMSA results 
indicating a negative competitiveness effect (Chart 1.3). A closer look at the exports 
market concentration2/among Thailand’s trading partners showed that while other countries
may rely heavily on agricultural and agro -manufacturing product from Thailand, the 
dependency has declined from levels seen in the past (Chart 3) due to Thailand’s worsened
productivity and cost competitiveness compared to its competitors.
In summary, Thai merchandise exports would likely increase with the global 
economic recovery but spillover benefits may be limited. Exports of petrochemicals 
and electronics are subjected to idiosyncratic factors weighing down the recovery. Going 
forward, there is also a need to monitor competitiveness of Thai exports, which could 
impact merchandise exports such as agricultural and agro -manufacturing products.

Upside risks to growth
•Foreign tourist arrivals and tourism spending turn out higher than 
expected if tourism demand recovers faster and stronger than expected.
•Budget disbursement is not as delayed as expected if the FY2024 
fiscal budget is approved in a timely manner or if government spending can
still proceed by temporarily using the previous year’s budget framework .  
Downside risks to growth
•Global economic recovery is slower than expected due to elevated 
inflation and banking stresses in some advanced economies, thus impacting
Thai exports going forward. 
•High living costs and household debts weigh down on private consumption
more than expected. The Thai economy could outperform the baseline growth projection from the higher -than-expected foreign tourist 
arrivals and tourism spending.

•Trading partner economies’ growth for 2023 is revised up slightly on account of a 
gradual recovery in global demand driven by advanced economies and China’s

above target and tighter financial conditions. 
•The Federal Funds Rate is revised up in line with the economic outlook as well as 
inflation remaining high for longer than expected. 
•Regional currencies (excluding the Chinese yuan) would appreciate due to the 
recovery in the services sector and tourism, and further policy rate hikes by central 
banks in the region. 
•Dubai crude oil prices for 2023 is revised down on account of price outturns and the 
limited impact of sanctions against Russia on supply of crude oil. The forecast for 2024 is 
unchanged given that oil demand would recover in line with the global economy and 
supply from non -OPEC oil producers would continue to increase. 
•Farm income (excluding government support measures) in 2023 would contract 
due to a lower in -season rice output as a result of less rainfall and a lower tapioca 
output as a result of previous floods. Farm income in 2024 would see a smaller 
contraction as swine output problems have subsided. 
•Public spending at current prices for 2023 is revised down on account of accelerated
budget disbursements for government consumption spending around end -2022 and

31/53The Thai Economy
Assumptions for Dubai crude oil prices
for 2023 is revised down on account of lower -than-expected price outturns and limited impact of sanctions against Russia on the supply of crude oil. 
Dubai crude oil prices forecast for 2023 is revised down from 95 U.S. dollar to 86 U.S. 
dollar per barrel on account of: 
• Lower -than-expected price outturns due to concerns about policy rate hikes by various 
central banks and the global economic slowdown 
• Limited impact of sanctions against Russia on the supply of crude oil. The ceiling on 
crude oil prices and bans on import of petroleum products from Russia implemented 
earlier have not significantly impacted crude oil output from Russia. Russia is still able to 
export oil to China and India to compensate for lower imports by Europe. 
Dubai crude oil prices forecast for 2024 is unchanged with prices expected to rise further 
on the back of the global economic recovery and continued increase in crude oil supply from 
non-OPEC producers.
Risk to the outlook for Dubai crude oil prices is tilted to the upside.
• Upside risks: The Russia -Ukraine conflict could escalate, broaden, and become more

32/53Financial Conditions
Financial Conditions: Key Issues
The baht’s movement have been 
volatile due to the recovery in Thai 
tourism, the Fed’s monetary policy 
direction, and concerns pertaining 
to banking stresses abroad. Financial conditions remain 
accommodative 
and supportive of fund mobilization 
by the private sector despite having 
tightened somewhat as borrowing costs 
have increased in line with 
the policy rate. Private credit and bond issuance 
have continued to expand 
and would grow further as the 
economy recovers.
33/53Financial Conditions
Thailand’s overall financial conditions remain accommodative. Financial conditions have tightened somewhat but remain 
supportive of the ongoing economic recovery. 
Financial conditions tightened somewhat in line with the higher policy rate
but remain accommodative
-Funding costs increased in line with the policy rate, but commercial banks ’ 
lending rates and bond yields are still below levels seen in the past. 
-Private credit expanded but at a slower pace because (1 ) large corporates 
have previously accelerated their borrowings to lock in costs; (2) business 
credit extended to the manufacturing sector slowed down in tandem with 
recent exports performance; and (3) SMEs credit contracted mainly due to 
repayments on maturing soft loans. Commercial banks remain cautious in 
lending to certain groups of SMEs, but overall credit demand from both large 
corporates and SMEs would continue to increase with the economic recovery.
Tighter financial conditions were also partly attributed to short -term volatility 
in the global financial market, which is driven by external factors and can shift 
abruptly. Global market volatility reflecting risk aversion in the market has 
impacted Thailand’s financial conditions mainly through the baht’s movement . 
Nonetheless, financial conditions arestill considered accommodative at current 
baht’s level.-2024

Policy rate%
Lending rates and deposit rates offered by commercial banks have gradually increased, but are still below levels seen in the past. Since the MPC’s 
decision to raise the policy rate to 1.75% and the end of the FIDF fee reduction measure at end -2022, commercial banks have grad ually transmitted the higher 
financing costs to the minimum retail rate (MRR) less than the minimum loan rate (MLR) to soften the impact on vulnerable bor rowers, most of whom are 
subject to the MRR. The New Loan Rate (NLR) as of January 2023 declined slightly overall, especially for loan contracts larger than 500 million baht. 
Meanwhile, the NLR for loan contracts smaller or equal to 500 million baht has increased. Commercial banks’ lending rates have increased in line with the policy rate, but arestill below levels seen in the past.

Short-term bond yields increased from the previous quarter in line with the higher policy rate. Meanwhile, long -term bond yields decreased slightly in line with 
US Treasury yields. The market expects the Fed to slow down the pace of its policy rate hikes after the recent banking stresses. The Thai financi al market is largely 
unaffected by the recent banking stresses and therefore Thai bond yields did not see a significant decline. Meanwhile, privat e sector financing costs through the bond 
market remain largely unchanged as reflected by relatively stable credit spread. Short -term government bond yields increased in line with the policy rate. Long -term government bond yields decreased 
slightly in line with US Treasury yields. Private sector financing costs through the bond market remain largely unchanged.

Q4-22
1.72/In Q4/2022, large corporate loans (credit limit > 500 million baht) slowed down from 
the previous quarter mainly due to debt repayment. The slowdown was mostly observed 
in the manufacturing sector, which was in line with manufacturing for exports, which 
slowed down in tandem with trading partners’ demand and front -loaded production in the 
earlier period. Large corporates have also accelerated bond issuance to lock in costs 
during the interest rate upcycle. 
SME loans (credit limit ≤ 500 million baht ) contracted from the same period last year . 
This was in part due to repayment on maturing soft loans.
Household credits slowed down from the previous quarter mainly from personal 
loans. This was partly due to the transfer of one bank’s credit card and personal loan 
portfolio to its subsidiary in December 2022. Auto loans grew slightly in line with 
domestic car sales. Meanwhile, mortgage loans continued to expand in the period 
leading up to the end of some housing market support measures in 2022.   
For Q1/20231/, demand for credit would continue to increase, especially from SMEs
that utilizes the loan for working capital purposes as well as building up its goods 
inventory in preparation for the economic recovery. Meanwhile, there is also increasing
credit demand from large corporates for mergers and acquisitions. Household credit would
expand in line with increasing consumption spending needs, and continuing improvements
in consumer confidence.
Note: 1/Report on Credit Conditions Q4/2022 and Outlook for Q1/2023 Private credit in Q4/2022 continued to expand driven by increased bond issuance by large corporates.

especially tourism -related services. New loans to manufacturing businesses slowed down after having accelerated in the earlier p eriod. New loans to SMEs have 
continued to increase even though banks have been more cautious in extending loans to SMEs because credit quality has not yet significantly improved1/.New loans 
to large corporates slowed down after having accelerated in the earlier period, partly because some businesses opted to issue more bonds to lock in costs.

Appreciation
In Q1/2023, the baht averaged 33.93 per U.S. dollar, appreciating by 7.2% from the average value in the previous quarter. The baht’s appreciation during the earlier parts of 
the quarter was initially due to China’s reopening announcement and expectations about the recovery in Thai tourism, but was later driven by uncertainties pertaining to the 
monetary policy of major central banks following high inflation outturns in both the US and Europe, and banking stresses in a dvanced economies. The nominal effective exchange 
rate (NEER) averaged 117.82, appreciating from the previous quarter. This was because the baht appreciated more than trading partners’ and competitors’ currencies, especially 
the US and China. There has been net capital outflow from both bond and equity markets during the first quarter. In particular, outflows from the equity market were due to 
lower -than-expected GDP and current account balance outturns in Thailand. Thebaht appreciated from theprevious quarter .Thebaht’s movements have been volatile duetoboth external
andThailand -specific factors .

economic and inflation outlook, 
and stands ready to adjust size 
and timing should the outlook 
shifts from the current 
assessment.  Financial stability
remains sound overall but 
banking stresses in advanced

of the vulnerable groups 
must be monitored.Economic growth
The Thai economy would 
continue to expand and 
might post stronger growth

The Thai economy would continue to expand and has already returned to pre -COVID levels. Tourism and private 
consumption are the key drivers of growth, while exports would see a stronger recovery in H2/2023 before resuming
