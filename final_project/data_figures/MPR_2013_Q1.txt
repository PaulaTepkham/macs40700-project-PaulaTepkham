The Monetary Policy Report  is prepared quarterly by staff of the 
Bank of Thailand with the approval of the Monetary Policy Committee 
(MPC).  It serves two purposes: ( 1) to communicate  to the public  the 
MPC’s  consideration and rationales for the conduct of monetary policy, 
and (2)  to present the latest set of  economic and inflation forecast s, based 
on which  the monetary policy decisions  were made .

Monetary Policy in Thailand  
The Monetary Policy Committee  
Under the Bank of Thailand Act, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) comprise of the 
Governor and two deputy Governors, as well as four distinguished external members  
representing various sectors of the country, with the aim to provide monetary policy decisions 
that are effective and transparent.  
 
The Monetary Policy Objective  
The MPC sets monetary policy with the objective to suppor t sustainable a nd full potential 
economic growth, without causing inflationary problems or economic and financial imbalances 
or bubbles.  
 
The Monetary Policy Target  
The Cabinet approves the use of quarterly average core inflation with the range of 0.5 -3.0 
percent as its policy target for 2013, as proposed by the MPC together with the Minister of 
Finance.  In the event that the target is missed, the MPC is required to explain the reasons 
and resolution thereof to the public.  
 
The Monetary Policy Instrument  
The MPC utilizes the 1 -day bilateral repurchase transaction rate as the key policy rate to 
signal the monetary policy stance.  
 
Evaluating economic conditions and forecasts  
The Bank of Thailand considers information from all sources, the macroeconomic model, data 
in each economic sector, as well as direct opinions from large enterprises and small and 
medium -sized  enterprises from all over the country,  and various financial institutions to ensure 
that economic evaluations and forecasts are accurate and covers all aspects, both in the 
macro and micro levels.   
 
Monetary Policy Communication  
Recognizing the importance of Monetary Policy communication to the public, the MPC 
arrange many forms of communication, both in Thai and English, such as (1) organizing a 
press statement at 14.00 hrs. on the day of the meeting, (2) publishing Minutes of th e MPC 
meeting two weeks after the meeting, and (3) publishing the Monetary Policy Report  
every quarter.  Monetary Policy Report  January 2013

1.1 Growth and inflation prospects  
The Thai economy was  likely to expand 
continu ously, while inflation  pressure was poised  to 
stabilize.  
The Thai economy  grew at a higher -than-
expected rate  in the second half of 2012 on the back 
of robust  domestic demand, despite  the greater  
impact  of the global econom ic slowdown on exports  
compared to the previous period .  Meanwhile, p rivate 
consumption continued to expand , supported by 
government stimulus measures, while  business sector 
investments  to replace and restore damage s caused 
by the flood last  year we re higher than assessed.  On 
this front, domestic demand  momentum  was the key 
factor responsible for the higher -than-assessed The Thai economy experienced better -than-expected growth in the 
second half of 2012 due to greater domestic demand  momentum , while 
impacts from the slowdown in exports following global economic conditions 
were limited.  Private consumption and investment were expected to exhibit 
steady growth over the projection period supported by a number of favorable 
factors .  Meanwhile, ex ports recovered gradually and would  lend more support 
to growth in the latter half of 2013.  Inflation pressure was likely to remain 
subdued , similar to the previous assessment.  
The MPC assessed that given uncertain global economic conditions 
and inflation  outlook remaining in the target range, maintaining the policy rate 
at the current level was appropriate in supporting domestic demand to sustain 
growth momentum going forward.  The MPC thus voted to hold the policy rate 
at 2.75 percent per annum in its la st two meetings.

20142    Monetary Policy Report  January 2013  economic  expansion in 2012 .  Looking ahead, the 
MPC evaluated that the Thai economy was  likely to 
experience strong continual growth from domestic 
spending , thanks to  additional  suppor t compared to 
the previous proj ection.  In particular,  the first -car tax 
rebate scheme, a personal income tax cut , as well as 
investments both for ongoing repairs and replacements  
in some industries and to accommodate  strong 
domestic demand.   As a result, Thai economic growth  
projection  for 2013 was slightly adjusted upwards 
compared to the previous projection .  The MPC 
assessed  that expor ts would  recover  gradually and 
regain its role as a driver of growth in the latter half of 
2013 . (Chart 1.1 and Table 1.1)  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The major downside risk to growth was the 
fragile global economy, particularly in developed 
economies which were likely to  encounter delays in 
recover y.  Nevertheless, risks  from the overall global 
economy were  lower than previously assessed, due 
to progress in the resolution of  Greece’s sovereign 
debt problem which  helped  lower  the risk of Greece 
leaving the euro area.  In addition, uncertainty 
surrounding the  US fiscal cliff declined after the 
House of Representatives and the Senate reach ed 
an agreement .  Domestic risk was higher  than Table 1.1 Forecast summary

public sector risks could surface from uncertainty and 
delays in some investment projects.  
Overall, the MPC assessed  that downside 
risks to growth , mainly from global economic 
headwinds,  would dominate upside risks.  
Accordingly, the fan chart for growth remained 
skewed downward but to a lesser degree compared 
to the previous projection  (Chart 1.2) . 
Inflation pressure was expected to  remain 
subdued , similar to the previous projection .  Cost 
pressures subside d somewhat , in line with  the price  
trend of domestic fresh  food and global non-fuel 
commodities .  Meanwhile, demand pressure was likely 
to increase on account of  stronger  momentum from 
domestic spending .  The MPC thus kept the previous 
projection for inflation in 2 013 and assessed  that 
inflation would  remain stable in 2014 (Table 1.1).  
Meanwhile, c ore inflation would  remain around the 
mid-point of the target range.  Going forward, risks to 
inflation were expected to balance  out, compared to 
the previous  assessment where risks were weighed to 
the downside .  This was because downside risks from 
the world economic trend subsided  from the previous 
assessment .  The fan c harts for inflation were  thus 
balanced over the proje ction period, compared to  
those previously skewed downward (Charts 1.3 and 
1.4). 

Momentum from robust domestic demand 
should continu e, while the export sector would  
gradually recover and lend more support to growth  in

-14    Monetary Policy Report  January 2013  The Thai economy  was expected to expand  
continuously .  
In the latter half o f 2012, the Thai economy 
expanded  well following robust  private demand, 
despite the growing impact of the global economic 
slowdown on exports.  Momentum from p rivate 
spending continued  and was higher than previously 
assessed .  This was partly due to more -than-expected 
repair and replacement  investments , especially in  
the integrated circuit industry . In addition , some 
businesses  resumed planned investments after they 
ascertained that flood problems  would not re cur at  the 
end of the year.  Private consumption wa s also 
supported by the first -car tax rebate scheme , with the 
number  of subscriptions exceeding expectation .  In 
2012, pr ivate spending, which had not been 
significantly affected by the slowdown in export s, wa s 
the main contributor to the  slightly higher -than-
projected economic growth  (Table 1.1) .   
 Looking ahead, the MPC evaluate d that Thai 
economic growth wa s likely to be higher  than 
previously assessed (Table 1.1 and Chart 1.5) .  
Domestic demand would continue to serve as the 
main driver  of growth in 2013, with private 
consumption  fueled  by momentum from the  first-car 
tax rebate scheme and a cut in personal income tax 
in the 2013 tax year.  Moreover , private investment 
was likely to expand robustly  following an increase in 
investments to accommodate strong domestic demand  
and ongoing reconstruction  in some industries.  
Meanwhile, the export sector was expected to  
recove r gradually before resuming its role as engine 
of economic growth in th e latter half of 2013, which 
would  help sustain growth after effects from 
government stimulus measures taper off (Table 1.2) .

The global economy showed  signs of 
improvement . 
Although the overall global economy was likely 
to remain weak, key economic data recently  reflect ed 
steady improvements in economic stability.  
Thailand ’s trading partners’ economies we re 
expected  to recover gradually in 2013 (Chart 1.6 ).  
Recovery of the US economy as well as growth in 
China and emerg ing economies would help  drive the 
global  economy, particularly in the second half of the 
year.  However, economies of the euro area and 
Japan  were likely to weaken  from the previous 
assess ment .  Recovery  in the overall global economy 
was in line  with the direction of key  economic 
indicators, such as steady  upward adjustments of the 
Global Purchasing Manager Index (PMI) in the past 
periods . 
The euro area’s economy was  temporarily 
supported by short -tem improvements in confidence 
(Chart 1.7) .  This was  due to progress in the 
resolution of  Greece ’s sovereign debt crisis and the 
announcement of the European Central Bank 
(ECB)’s Outright Monetary Transactions (OMTs)  in 
the previous period s.  The MPC assessed  that euro 
area economies would recover slowly, mainly 
bolstered by Germany’s solid economic fundamentals,  Table 1.2 Forecasts for GDP and components

global demand , as well as improving  signals from the 
manufacturing sector.  N onetheless, the recovery 
trend wa s expected to soften  from the previous  
assessment .  This wa s partly due to implementation 
of fiscal consolidation by many countries which would  
deter the  real economy and delay reco very.  
Consequently, euro area economies in 2013 were  
expected  to contract from the previous year, with 
fiscal austerity measures and financial institutions’  strict 
credit conditions  constraining  domestic  demand 
recovery going forward.   
  On this front, the MPC viewed that downside 
risks from the euro area declined  markedly from t he 
previous assessment, thanks to the lower risk  of 
Greece exiting the euro area . This was a  result of the 
government’s success in restructuring  debt in the 
previous periods,  as well as additional assistance 
from the euro area, namely, an  agreement to relax 
loan terms and an exten sion of the fiscal 
consolidation  timeframe .  This reduction in risk was 
the main reason for the significant  upward adjustment 
on the euro area’s economic growth assumption in 
the worse case scenario (Chart 1.7) . 
The US economy was  expected  to recover 
gradually over the projection period  (Chart 1.8) .  
Although private consumption wa s boosted by a 
pickup  in the housing sector and l abor market, overall 
demand would  remain weak for some time.  
Nevertheless, uncertainty regarding the fiscal cliff 
declined after the House of Representatives and 
Senate came to an agreement on extending  several 
fiscal stimulus measures which were to  be terminated 
end-2012. These include d a cut in the personal 
income tax rate and an extension of federal 
unemployment benefits, which would  help shore up 
private spending, as well as help reduce downside 
risks to US economic growth going forward.  Left axis:           Oct 12 (baseline )   Right axis:     Change in baseline

and sequestration, which need to be finalized by 
February 2013, remained key risks to the economy 
and could affect private sector sentiment in the periods 
ahead.  
Asian economies were  poised to pick up in 
2013 on account of  strong domestic demand which 
would  help ease impacts from the export sector (Chart 
1.9).  The manufactu ring sector became more stable , 
as reflect ed by a rise in many countries’ Manufacturing 
Purchasing Manager Index  (details in Chapter  2, 
Chart 2.5) .  Fur thermore, signs of improvement we re 
also found  in export  demand , as reflected by key 
indicators, such as the US’ ISM New Orders which 
started to improve  in line with economic recovery  in 
the US , one of Asia’s major  export markets .  
Meanwhile, the Chinese economy was driven mainly 
by domestic d emand, with consumption expec ting to 
lend more support to growth later on .   Compared to 
the previ ous projection, the MPC assessed  that risks 
from Asian economies would increase  from Japan’s  
weakening  economic  trend  (Chart 1.10) , after Japan’s  
exports declined markedly in the second half of 2012.  
As a consequence,  private  investment conditions and 
sentiment  were also affected .  An additional risk  could 
also arise from prolonged territorial dispute between 
China and Japan .     
Thailand’s export sector would recover  
gradually in line with the global economy.  
Thai exports  started  to recover and would  
have a bigger role in the Thai economy in the second  
half of 2013.  Meanwhile, imports were  likely to rise in 
line with a pickup  in domestic demand and exports.  
Merchandise e xports were still hindered  by 
the global economy, but should  have passed the ir 
trough , with  signs of gradual improvement  (Table 
1.3).  Export s of manufacturing products started to 
show sig ns of stabilization, with a more concrete  Left axis:           Oct 12 (baseline)    Right axis:     Change in baseline

was in line with unraveling of constraint  problems in  IC 
production, and a gradual pickup in world demand.  
Meanwhile, exports of agricultural products in 2013 
were  likely to stabilize before increasing  slightly.  
Rice exports were  expected to expand from the 
previo us year which experienced lower -than-normal 
exports.  In addition, exports of rubber were  expected 
to benefit from China’s economy which could  recover  
faster than assessed.  The gradual recovery in Thai 
exports was consistent with the region’s export trend 
which also started to display signs of recovery.  
Meanwhile, t he tourism sector was expe cted to 
expand continuously .  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The MPC assessed  that the export sector 
would  recover gradually  before taking on  a greater 
role in  driving  the Thai economy in the latter half of 
2013 and into 2014 , alongside  private demand  
and public investment .  Nevertheless , risks to export 
recovery in early 2013 remain ed, as global demand 
for some products had  not yet shown clear  signs of  
recovery, particularly in  electronics.  This was reflected  in 
key indicators, such as the book -to-bill ratio in the 
US’ semi -conductor industry , which indicated  that 
demand was weak and inventory level remained  
high.   Table  1.3 Forecasts for the external sector

decelerate back to its normal trend in 2013 after  
high acceleration in the previous year.  Imports of 
consumer goods were  expected to expand well in line 
with robust  domestic demand.   Meanwhile, imports of 
capital goods were  likely to decelerate from the 
previous period , following investments in flood 
reconstruction  which would taper off soon.  The MPC 
viewed that quarterly momentum  would decline  from 
end-2012 which saw more -than-normal acceleration  
due to  temporary factors.  These  factors include d the 
surge in imports of machinery and equipment  once  
businesses were certain  that flood problems would 
not recur at the end of the year,  as well as 
acceleration in imports before exemption of import 
duty on machineries to replace those damaged by 
the flood  expired  in end-2012 .    
Relative to the previous assessment, th e MPC 
expected  the current account balance1 to show a lower 
surplus in 2013 (Table 1.3) , owing to higher 
merchandise imports in line  with domestic demand.  
For 201 4, the current account surplus wa s expected  to 
decline from  the previous year, partly due to claim 
payouts from foreign insurance companies  which  
were expected to end.  
Continual m omentu m from private demand  
Private consumption and investment would  
continue to expand well , backed by  many strong  
supporting factors.  
Private consumption would continue to 
experience above -normal expansion for some time 
and would remain  the main engine of economic 
growth over the projection period.  This was boosted 
by favorable household income, as well as continuous  
government stimulus measures, particularly from the 
first-car tax rebate scheme with tax return payments 
beginning in October 2012.  At the same time, the 
                                                        
1 Including reinvested earnings  10    Monetary Policy Report  January 2013  increase in automobile expenditure s did not lower 
spending on other consumer goods.  Compa red to 
the previo us projection, the MPC evaluated  that 
private consumption in 2013 would  be higher than 
previously projected , before slowing down slightly in 
2014 given  high consumption in the previous periods , 
particularly in automobiles.  Domestic suppor ting factors  
increased from the previous projection , fueled by  
more -than-expected subscriptions for the first-car tax 
rebate scheme as well as the  ability of most 
producers to expedite deliver y of cars.  In addition, 
cutting  the personal income tax rate  for the 2013 tax 
year would  increa se after tax  income , which was 
expected  to boost household spending to some 
extent.  
 Looking ahead, many factors supporting 
consumption  remain ed strong  and would  help sustain 
consumption momentum after some government  
stimulus measures started to taper off in the second half 
of 2013.  Key support ive factors include d (1) favorable 
household  income prospects, given the increase in 
minimum wage and civil servant  salary, ongoing 
measures to support agricultural prices, along with 
positive f arm income prospects from improved 
agricultural prices --in particular the price of rubber which 
was expected to increase from the current level 
following expansion in the Chinese economy  and ric e 
prices which would  remain high due to an extension of 
the rice pledging scheme; (2) cons umer confidence  
remained healthy, stemm ing from government 
measures to help raise short -term purchasing power, as 
well as a stable inflation  trend; and (3) monetary 
conditions remain ed accommodative and support ive of  
household credit growth , while  household’s ability to 
service debt remain ed satisfactory.   High consumer 
loans, however,  was a risk factor that warrant ed 
monitor ing going forward.    Monetary Policy Report  January 2013                    11 Private investment wa s expected  to accelerate  
more than previously assessed.   In 2013, investment  
was expected to grow close to the long -term average, 
due to investment s by businesses  to accommodate  
domestic demand growth, particularly  in automobile  
and power generator s.  Meanwhile, investments in 
machinery and equipment, as well as in construction 
were  still sustained by reconstruction in some 
industries, such as the integrated circuit industry, 
which was expected to continue into early  2013 .  The 
MPC assesse d that overall investment would  still 
benefit from the up -cycle in investment which started 
since 2009. Furthermore,  there were several supporting  
factors over the medium - and long -term:  (1) 
Businesses  remain ed confiden t in the Thai economy 
and were  likely to invest according to  their long-term 
plans.  There continued to be demand for i nvestment  
in Thailand , as reflected by rising values of 
application and issuance of investment promotion 
certificates by the BOI and high levels of foreign 
direct investment  in various industries .  (2) Overall 
monetary conditions remain ed supportive, with a 
broad -based corporate loan expansion , due partly to 
low interest rates and relaxed credit standards.  (3)  
Long -term public investment s in infrastructure were 
more concrete and would  crowd in  private investment 
going forward.   And (4) i nvestment in 3G projects, 
which was  likely to begin  in 2013 . 
Some key challenges to private investment 
need ed monitoring , in particu lar delays in public 
investment  on long -term water management and 
infrastructure projects.  In addition, fragile recovery in 
industrial countries  could  affect investment decisions 
in export -oriented industries.  With regard to the 
nationwide minimum wage increase to 300  baht in 
2013, the  MPC evaluated that it would  not have a 
significant e ffect on the overall econ omy as most 
businesses had sufficient profits to cushion the 
impact , and ha d, to some extent, already adjusted by 12    Monetary Policy Report  January 2013  reducing expenditures and increasing productivity.  
Furthermore,  the wage increase was not expected to 
affect overall employment  conditions  much , due to 
the tight labor market .  At the same time, the MPC 
evaluate d that the hike in minimum wage would also 
benefit the overall economy, via consumption  
spending  and investment in the manufacturing  sector 
to replace manual labor.   
Public  spending continued  to provide economic  
stimulus  
Fiscal stimulus continue d at a level close to the 
previous projection and would  play a key role in 
supporting private spending  going forward.  
Fiscal spending would continue to provide 
stimulus over the projection period, as reflected by a 
high proportion of budget deficit compared to GDP.  
The budget deficit for fiscal years 2013 and 2014  was 
expected to stand at 300 and 250 bi llion baht, 
respectively (Chart 1.11) .  The MPC evaluated  that 
public spending in fiscal year 2013 wa s likely to be 
similar to that in the previous projection (Table 1.4) .  
Meanwhile, c onsumption  spending was likely to 
increase slightly due to a reduction in transfer payment s 
consistent  with actual data , while public investment was 
expected to slow  down on the back of  lower carry -over 
due to higher -than-projected investment in the previous 
fiscal year.   Disbursements of the expenditure budget  
and investment  budget in fiscal year 2013  Q1 
accelerated more than expected due to  back payment 
of the academic standing allowance  and state 
enterprise’s import of aircraft s.  As a result, spending for 
the rest of the fiscal year decelerated  slightly  from the 
previous assumption.

Note: FY denotes fiscal year.Monetary Policy Report  January 2013                    13 Apart from the above budget expenditure , the 
MPC assessed  that investment expenditure on the 
water management project of 350 billion baht could  
delay  from that previously assessed. This would  
disperse disburseme nts out to  later fiscal years. 
Meanwhile, long -term infrastructure inves tments became 
more concrete.  Most recently, the Budget Act draft  
was approved by the Strategic Committee for 
Reconstruction and Future Development (SCRF) with 
investments expect ed to commence at the end of 
fiscal year 2014 . The MPC evaluated  that the 
aforementioned  investment project  was a key  factor 
that would  help mitigate limitations  of the manufacturing  
sector and build  up business confidence in the  
long-term.  
1.3 Inflation pressure  
 Inflation pressure  was likely to remain stable, 
similar to the previous  assessment.   The slightly rising  
trend of de mand pressure wa s offset by softening 
cost pressure.  Risks to inflation were  balanced.  
Inflation pres sure was likely to remain stable  
 Overall inflation pressure stabilized , similar to 
the previou s assessment. Demand pressure wa s 
likely to rise slightly, in line with higher -than-expected 
momentum from private spending.  This wa s due to a 
boost in cons umption from  the first-car tax rebate 
scheme  which was higher than expected and 
ongoing investments for reconstruct ion in so me 
industries. The MPC assessed  that demand pressure 
would  continue in the periods ahead, owing to the 
likelihood of the Thai economy growing near its 
potential, as reflected by the near zero output gap 
over the projection period (Chart 1.12) .

-1014    Monetary Policy Report  January 2013   Cost pressure, however, wa s likely to soften 
somewhat, partly due to  lower expansion in domestic  
fresh food prices in 2013 (Chart 1.13) , following  
higher -than-expected supply of meats into the 
market. Furthermore, the pass -through of higher 
global grain prices , from drought problems  in the US , 
to costs of animal feed  and prices of pork, poultry and 
eggs was relatively low.  Meanwhile , rice prices  
were likely to remain stable. In addition, non -fuel 
commodity prices in the global market were  also 
expected  to soften from the previous assessment 
(Chart 1.14)  given abundant supply of food products 
than previously  expected due to an  increase in planting 
area and yield.   Prices in 2013 were  expected  to remain 
stable before rising gradually i n line with world 
demand which wa s expected to recover more clearly  
in the lat ter half of the year . 
 Global crude oil price s were  likely to remain 
stable over the projection period (Chart 1.15) .  The 
MPC p rojected  baseline assumptions on Dubai oil 
price in 2013 and 2014 at 105 and 110 US dollars per 
barrel, respectively, unchanged  from the previous 
assessment.  High case and  low case assumptions 
on Dubai oil price  remain ed balance d at half a  
standard deviation  above and below the baseline 
path, because demand and supply fundamentals 
were assessed to be somewhat balanced and similar  
to the previous assessment.  Crude oil production in 
non-OPEC countries was likely to increase following 
resumed production after the shutdown for maintenance  
ended .  Nevertheless, OPEC was expected to manage  
overall oil production to balance with world demand in 
order to maintain oil prices close to the current level .  
 In this projection, the MPC adjusted  risks to 
inflation projection to be balanced, from that skewed 
downward in the previous projection. This wa s 
because downside risks from the domestic economy 
were likely to subside following strong momentum of Left axis:          Oct 12 (baseline )   Right axis:      Change in baseline

export sector. Meanwhile, risks from the global 
economy also receded following clearer actions 
regarding Greece’s sovereign debt  problem and US’ 
fiscal problem  in the past period s.  Still, some upside 
risks to inflation remain ed from t ensions in the Middle 
East which could pressure global oil prices, and from 
the impact of the minimum wage hike on domes tic 
prices which could  be greater  than estimated.  
 
1.4 Monetary policy decision   
 Policy stance remain ed accommodative  
The MPC deemed the current policy rate 
appropriate in supporting  domestic demand to sustain 
Thai economic growth. The MPC thus voted to hold 
the policy rate in its last two meetings . 
In its meeting on November 28, 2012, the 
MPC judged that the global economy remained  
stable and exhibited signs of improvement.  US 
economic data were better  than expected, especially 
in the labor and housing markets , although the fiscal 
cliff remained a key risk factor . Meanwhile, Chinese 
and Asian economies al so showed signs of 
improvement.  Thailand was poised to expand 
continuously, with  global  impact  limited only to 
export -related sectors . Exports were  expected to  
begin recovery in the first half of 2013, on the back  
of global economic recovery.  Meanwhile, private 
consumption and investment would  continue to be 
the main driver s of economic growth goi ng forward . 
Inflation pressure stabilized at a moderate level close 
to the previous meeting . The MPC viewed that as 
downside risks to g rowth subsided  and with inflation 
pressure in check, the current policy rate remained 
accommodative and conducive to growth.  The MPC 
therefore voted unanimously to maintain the policy 16    Monetary Policy Report  January 2013  rate at 2.75 percent per annum  and would stand 
ready to take appropriate policy action as warranted.         
In its subsequent meeting on January 9, 
2013, the MPC assessed that the overall world 
economy recovered gradually, with improving signals 
from the previous meeting, led by  the US and China.  
In addition, the recent agreement to avert the US 
fiscal cliff  helped boost global financial market 
sentiment .  Meanwhile, the Thai economy in 20 12 Q4 
was likely to expand more  than previously assessed .  
Consequently, economic  growth in 2012 and growth 
projection for 2013 were expected to be higher than 
previously projected, driven mainly by strong private 
consumption and investment. Furthermore, the 
export sector showed incipient signs of a 
broad‐based recovery, while the services sector and 
tourism expanded robustly.  Inflation pressure  remained 
stable , close to the previous meeting.  Nevertheless, 
the impact of a second‐round minimum wage increa se 
warranted monitoring.   The MPC assessed that the 
accommodative monetary policy stance throughout 
the previous year had significantly shored up private 
sector confidence, supported post ‐flood recovery, and 
helped cushion  the economy from the global econo mic 
headwinds.  The MPC viewed that, with remaining 
uncertainties  in the global economy and inflation 
forecast  within target, the current monetary policy 
stance was appropriate in supporting domestic  
demand to sustain growth momentum.  The MPC 
thus voted un animously to maintain the policy rate at 
2.75 percent per annum .  However, t he MPC w ould 
closely monitor fi nancial stability risks that could  arise 
from persistently high credit growth, rising household 
debt, and volatile capital flows .  Monetary Policy Report  January 2013                    17 1.5 Appendix :

Percent20   Monetary Policy Report  January 2013  Challenges from monetary easing by major economies  
and implications on Thailand  
Recent monetary policy implementation  by major economies  
During the past 4 -5 years, the global economic crisis and public debt problem in the euro 
area have  caused prolonged recessions in major economies, particularly the US, the euro area, 
the UK  and Japan. Despite many years of  low or  near-zero policy rates (Chart 1) , not much  
positive  economic impact has materialized partly owing to  low confidence of the private sector and 
investors coupled with uncertain income prospects from weak labor market conditions , leading  
consumers to slow spending, thus creating  a drag on recovery.    
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Against  the backdrop of longer -than-expected recovery of major economies and zero 
lower bound  limitation on policy rates , many central banks have opted for unconventional 
measures such as Q uantitative Easing (Q E) in the U S 1/, Outright Monetary Transactions (OMTs) 
in Europe2/, and Asset Purchase Programs in Japan and the UK .  These measures have caused 
the size of central banks’ balance sheets to expand  (Chart 2) , but the direct economic impact has 
still been  small due to overall weaknesses in financial conditions, leading  financial institutions to 
hold extra reserves instead of giving out loans .  
In addition, there has been  a major change in central banks’ communication. For example, 
the Federal Reserve and Bank of Canada have been communicating with forward guidance in 
order to lower long -term interest rates in the financial markets. Most recently, the Federal Reserve 
has communicated its policy rate path with reference to a macroeconomic target , announcing  to 
keep  the policy rate at 0 -0.25 percent per annum  given that the unemployment rate remained 
above 6.5 percent and inflation projection between 1 -2 years ahead was no mo re than half a 
percentage point above the Committee’s long -term inflation target of 2 percent .  This new 
communication strategy contrasts  with the pr evious one where referencing has  been made to 
calendar years, for example, an announcement to maintain the policy rate until mid -2015.  
 Despite  implementations of both conventional and unconventional measures by major 
economies’ central banks, their economic performance  has remained weak and unemployment 
                                                
1/ QE refers to the purchase of long -term government bonds and mortgage -backed securities (MBS) by the Federal 
Reserve  to support recovery in the US  labor and real estate markets. Four QEs have been announced since November 
2008 with the latest announcement (QE3+) in December 2012.  
2/ OMTs  refer to the unlimited purchase of Member S tates’ government bonds in the secondary markets by the ECB upon 
the requests of Member States.

and Bank of Japan  (BOJ)  2012 2012 2011 2011 2010 2010 2009 2009 2008 2008 2007 2007 2006 2006 2005Monetary Policy Report  January 2013  21 has been high .  As a result, it has been  suggested that t hese economies move to target nominal 
GDP (NGDP level targeting) whereby a nominal GDP growth target could be set to equal the long -
term average of real GDP growth plus the central banks’ inflation target  in order to further 
accommodate economic recoveries .  
 The concept of NGDP level targeting is “history dependence”. Suppose that the NGDP 
target is 4.5 percent per year. If actual NGDP growth is less than 4.5 percent in a particular year , 
i.e. lower  than the target path rate,  accommodative  monetary policy will be required to compensate 
for the missed target by stimulating economic growth beyond 4.5 percent until the  NGDP returns to 
its target  path. This type of monetary policy where bygones are not bygones is differen t from the 
forward -looking kind.  For example , in inflation targeting , a policy stance is deemed  appropriate if it 
can achieve a balance between growth and inflation in future periods regardless of current inflation 
and growth outturns.   
 Nevertheless, NGDP level targeting is st ill a theoretical suggestion at this stage given 
many practical limitations. (1) Determination of long -term average of real GDP growth is difficult. 
(2) The target lacks clarity as it is a combination of GDP and inflation. This problem makes 
communication with the public difficult, especially in explaining the central bank’s inflation target, 
which could ultimately un -anchor inflation expectations and affect the private sector’s assessment 
of future financing costs. (3) Policy implementation lacks flexibili ty given the low frequency  
(quarterly)  and long lag in NGDP announcement as well as data revisions.  
Implications to Thai land’s  policy implementation  
Looking ahead, it is expected that  major economies would remain weak for a while. Thus, 
even the use of NGDP level targeting would not guarantee a faster turnaround. On the other hand, 
central banks of major economies would need to conduct monetary easing for much longer to 
compensate  for the missed target path since the global crisis.  This would, in the end , create 
challenges to policy implementation of emerging economies, including Thailand, as follows.  
1. Implication on monetary policy  in Thailand . Recent weaknesses in major economies 
have caused Thai exports to slow down during some periods, posing risk to overall economic 
performance, going forward. Should major economies continue to fail to stimulate growth, greater 
risk would fall on the Thai economy and ultimately affect monetary policy stance.  
2. Implication on foreign exchange and capital flows.   Major economies’ near -zero policy 
rates ha ve caused interest rate differentials between these economies and emerging economies 
(including Thailand) to widen. Moreover, continuous liquidity injections have  also resulted in 
searches for yields in emerging economies , including Thailand , where growth prospects are 
promising. Such developments could have significant impacts on volatility of capital flows and the 
Thai baht.  
Nevertheless, the MPC has assessed that Thailand’s flexible inflation targeting (FIT) 
framework is appropriate to the country’s economic conditions and structure, particularly from its 
transparency and ease of communication. Moreover, many countries that have also been using 
this f ramework also register  satisfactory growth performance.  In Thailand’s case, since the 
adoption of FIT in 2000, growth performance has been satisfactory. Meanwhile, economic stability 
has been well maintained, as reflected by low inflation  and absence of i mbalances.  The 
framework has also been useful in cushioning the impact from the recent global economic crisis. 3/ 
 
                                                
3/  IMF’s latest research  (WP/12/269)  noted that without FIT and flexible exchange rates, the Thai economy would have been 
more severely  affected by the global economic crisis.  For example, if Thailand had used the fixed exchange rate policy, 
growth would have been 3.7 percent lower than actual outturn, which is considered quite high considering the normal growth 
rate of around 5 percent per year.

2.1 The global economy  
The US economy recovered gradually 
following improvements in employment conditions  which 
facilitated continued growth in private consumption.  
Moreover, clearer signs of recovery in the housing 
sector were also observed.  
In 2012 Q3, the US economy grew by 3.1 
percent from the previous quarter (Chart 2.1)  due to 
imperative positive factors.  These included a jump  in 
private consumption  growth , increase d investment in 
the housing sector, and acceleration in government 
spending on national defense , the latter a  temporary 
factor .  The world economy as a whole recovered gradually, showing signs of 
improvement, particular in the US and China.  Moreover, the recent agreement to 
avert the US fiscal cliff , as well as the euro area’s financial assistance and 
additional supportive measures for Greece helped bolster global financial market 
sentiment .  Nonetheless, the euro area  and Japanese economies remained 
weak , while resolution of their structural problem s would likely  take time.  
Meanwhile, economic performance of most Asian economies turned more 
positive on the back of strong domestic demand as well as modestly improving 
exports.  
 The Thai economy in 2012 Q4 was expected to expand from the previous 
quarter following strong domestic demand, supported by  consumer  and business  
confidence, favourable household income and high employment, as well as 
accommodative monetary conditions .  Meanwhile , the export sector  showed 
incipient signs of a broad -based recovery.  Inflation pressure should remain 
moderate goin g forward.  Nevertheless, the impact of the second -round minimum 
wage hike warrented monitoring .

Source: Bureau of Economic AnalysisPercent (Seasonally adjusted, annualized )24                          Monetary Policy Report  January 2013  In 2012 Q4, the US economy continued to 
expand, due mainly  to improvements in private 
consumption.  This was reflected by a surge  in retail 
sales, particular ly in  automobile sales which had 
remai ned high for several consecutive months,  
consistent  with improving  consumer confidence .   
The pickup in private consumption was mainly 
driven by the following supporting factors.  (1) Continued 
improvement in emp loyment conditions (Chart 2.2),  
which  led to a reduction in the unemployment rate to 
stand at 7.7 percent in November 2012, the lowest 
level since end -2008.  Nonetheless, the lower 
unemployment rate was partly due to a decline in 
labor force as some of the unemployed had left the 
workforce.  T his reflected that adjustments in the 
labor market would  take time.  And (2) clearer signs of 
recovery  in the housing sector , as reflected by 
continued improvement in home sales and continued 
increase s in housing prices compared to the same 
period of the p revious year.  This  increase in housing  
prices helped improve househo lds’ financial position 
and would  support private consumption going 
forward.  
Looking ahead, the MPC  viewed that the US 
economy would  recover gradually fol lowing FOMC’s 
accommodative monetary policy stance.  US growth, 
however, would remain subpar due to limitations of 
the fiscal stimulus package and the somewhat high 
unemployment rate.  In December 2012, the F ed 
announced additional economic stimulus polic ies 
which included (1) the purchase of long -term 
Treasury securities of 45 billion US dollars a month to 
replace the Maturity Extension Program (Operation 
Twist ) which completed at the end of 2012, and (2) 
keeping  the federal funds rate at 0 -0.25 percent pe r 
annum, given that the unemployment rate remain ed 
above 6.5 percent and inflation projection be tween 1 -
2 years ahead was  no more than half a percentage 036912

purchas e agency mortgage -backed securities (QE3) 
at a pace of 40 billion  US dollars  per month to 
support continuous recovery in the labor market and 
housing sector which had already started to show 
signs of recovery.   
Moreover, the main factor driving  economic  
recovery in the US going forward would be  
the gradual and continuous improvement in 
employment  conditions , especially in the business 
sector following an increasing investment  trend .  
Despite progress in cutting the personal income tax 
rate and extension  of federal unemployment benefits , 
fiscal cliff uncertainties arising from debt ceiling and 
sequestration , which need to be finalized by February 
2013 , remained key risks to the economy and could 
affect short -term confidence . 
The euro area’s economy weaken ed dur ing 
the latter half of 2012.  However,  the risk of Greece 
exiting the euro area  subsided  after Member States 
approved additional assistance to Greece.  This wa s 
expected to support economic recovery of  the euro 
area in 2013.   
In 2012 Q3, the euro area economy 
contracted by 0.1 perce nt from the previous quarter 
owing  to fiscal consolidation measures in almost 
every Member State and financial institutions’ strict 
lending standards , as well as the slowdown in private 
spen ding due mainly to the  prolong ed and uncertain  
sovereign debt crisis.    
The risk of Greece exiting  the euro area 
subsided.  In the December  13, 2012 meeting, euro 
area finance m inisters jointly concluded on further 
assistance to Greece.  This  includ ed exten ding Greece’s 
timeframe to  reduc e its fiscal deficit, extending loan 
maturity, reducing loan  interest rates, as well as 
approv ing the disbursement of financial aid to Greece 26                          Monetary Policy Report  January 2013  of 41.9 billion euro. Moreover, Greece was 
successful in  buying back its bonds held by private 
investors  of 31.9 billion euro, which helped lower 
sovereign debt by 9.5 percent of GDP.  Due to these 
measures and the buy-back of government bonds, 
Greece’s sovereign  debt wa s expected to fall to 124 
percent of GDP by 2020 , which would  improve fiscal 
sustainability.   
The lower risk of Greece exiting  the euro area 
together with the European Central Bank’s (ECB) 
announcement to  undertake O utright Monetary 
Transactions (OMTs) led to an increase in the 
Composite PMI , both the Manufacturing PMI and the 
Services PMI, as we ll as improvements in the 
German Ifo Business Climate index and the French  
INSEE Business Climate index (Chart 2.3) .  
 The MPC assessed that the euro area 
economy remained weak  with gradual  recover y 
expected in 2013 .  Despite favorable  factors  from 
stronger  confidence and  an increase in non-euro 
area export demand in light of  world economic 
recovery, there remain ed risks that could delay 
recovery.  These risks include d the prolonged and 
uncertain sovereign debt crisis which could heighten , 
and higher -than-expected adverse effects of fiscal 
consolidation measures on the euro area economy .  
The Japanese economy weakened 
significantly durin g the second half of 2012, but wa s 
expected to resume recovery in 2013 , driven by 
recovery in trading partner  economies  and the new 
government’s stimulus measures.  
In 2012 Q3, the Japanese economy contracted  
by 0.9 percent from the previous quarter, due to 
contractions in both exports and domestic demand 
(Chart 2.4) .  Exports declined in almost every majo r 
expor t market following weak  global demand and 
appreciation of the yen.  Main contracting export s 
include d automobiles and capital goods.  Moreover , Source: BloombergChart 2.3 Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI)

lower  income and consumer confidence following  
export shrinkage  and a reduction  in the government’s 
stimulus package.  
 The Japanese economy wa s likely  to contract  
further in 2012 Q4, with export s remaining fragile .  
Although  exports to the US expanded, exports to 
China were  expected to contract  further .  This was 
due to a plunge in Chinese demand for Japanese 
goods  following the dispute  between Japan and 
China over the Diaoyu or Senkaku Island.    Meanwhile,  
domestic demand remained sluggish, particularly in  
private investment, as reflected by BOJ’s Tankan 
Survey in 2012 Q4 on the Business Confidence Index 
of large industries which was revised down from the 
previous quarter, and was likely to fall further going 
forward.  
 The MPC assessed that Japan’s  economy  
would  remain sluggish , with slow recovery in 2013 , 
thanks to  trading partners’ economic recovery and 
the new government’s stimulus package . The 
Japanese government, which took office in December 
2012 , was expected to  implement accommodative 
monetary and fiscal polic ies to help stimulate the 
economy in 2013 Q1.  Nevertheless, effects from this 
stimulus package  could  be limited and w ould need to 
be monitored  further  (more details in BOX: Outlook 
on Japanese economic policy after the December 
2012 election) . 
Chinese  and many Asian economies  improved  in 
2012 Q4 compared to the previous quarter , owing to 
more stable production and exports .   
In 2012 Q4, most Asian economies picked up  
from the preceding quarter  due to continual recovery 
in the manufacturing  sector as reflected by 
improvements in the Purchasing Managers Index in 
many countries (Chart 2.5) .  Meanwhile, the export 
sector also displayed signs of improvement, Chart 2.5 Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index

Nonetheless , recovery in exports was mainly limited 
to telecommunication and high technology products 
due to  healthy  global demand for these products.  
Exports of ASEAN economies remained weak due to 
their smaller export share of high technology 
products .  Domestic demand of ASEAN economi es, 
however, continued to grow  strongly and somewhat 
helped cushion the slowdown in exports .   
For the outlook in 2013 , the MPC assessed 
that Asia n economies would improve gradually, 
driven by sustained robust domestic demand.  
Furthermore, clearer signs of recovery in global and 
Chinese economies would  help support recovery of  
regional  exports going forward.    
Improvements in t he Chinese economy 
became more apparent in 2012 Q4 compared to the 
previous quarter .  This was partly driven by the 
accommodative monetary policy stance and 
expedition of  infrastructure investment s in the previous 
periods , which started to show posit ive effects on 
economic growth i n various fronts, including 
consumption, investment and production.  Exports, 
meanwhile, improved in line with the more stable  
global economy and an increase in foreign  demand 
for telecommunication products .  
Looking ahead, the MPC assessed that the 
Chinese economy would impr ove steadily in 2013.  
This would  be driven by domestic demand.  In 
particular, consumption  would  lend more support to  
economic growth  on account of  favorable 
employment conditions and income level following 
wage increase s.  Other supporting  factors that would  
help drive the Chinese econom y in 2013 include d 
expedition of  public investment in both infrastructure 
investments  (Chart 2.6)  and investment s to enhance 
productivity  under the Twelfth  Five-year National 
Economic and Social Development plan ( 2011 -2015) .  -100102030

recover gradually in line with recovery in the real 
estate sector, as reflected by constant  increases  in 
real estate prices and sales volume.  Moreover, 
exports  were  likely to  recover slowly  following better 
world economic prospects.  
2.2 The domestic economy  
 The Thai economy in 2012 Q3  continued to 
expand from the previous quarter, driven by strong 
domestic spending, from both the private and public 
sectors .  This  helped offset  the slowdown in the export 
sector and production in export -oriented industries  
which were affected  by the global economic crisis.  
Economic conditions in 2012 Q3  
 In 2012 Q3, t he Thai economy expanded  by 
1.2 percent from the previous quarter (Chart 2.7) due 
mainly to expansions in the manufacturing and service s 
sectors.  Manufacturing  production rose by 1.6 percent 
from the preceding quarter , with growth concentrating 
mostly in production  for domestic consumption which 
remained strong.   In particular, automobile production  
grew exception ally well due to incentives from  
the government’s first -car tax rebate scheme .  
Nevertheless, the global economic slowdown caused 
manufacturing production in export -oriented industries 
to slow down sign ificantly compared to the previous 
quarter, particularly, in the hard disk d rive industry.      
The services sector  continued to expand from 
the previous quarter by 1.1 percent and was 
unaffected by the global economic slowdown.  In 
2012 Q3, t he tourism sector gr ew at a satisfactory 
level due  mainly to an increase in tourist arrivals  from 
East Asia.  Meanwhile, the number of tourists  from 
Europe was comparable to the previous quarter , as -12-8-404812

Europe so they could attend the UEFA European 
Football Championship and the Olympic Games  
which  was held in August .  At the same time, the 
transportation and trade sectors expanded in tandem 
with strong domestic demand. Other service s 
sectors , such as the real estate and construction 
sectors , also continued to grow well on the back  of 
government mega -projects such as the mass rapid  
transit systems project in Bangkok Metropolitan and 
its vicinity . 
Agricultural outputs remained high similar  
to that in the previous quarter, in particular production 
of second crop rice due to favorable water conditions 
and price incentives from the government’s rice 
pledging scheme.  In addition, other major agricultural  
outputs such as rubber, cassava  and palm  oil 
products  also expanded strongly owing to  favorable 
weather conditions, an increase in planting  area and 
lack of plant disease outbreak . 
Continual  economic growth  led the 
unemployment rate to remain low at 0.7 percent  in 
2012 Q3.  Impacts from the minimum wage hike on 
April 1, 2012 on employment were  not significant . 
Nonetheless, employment in the manufacturing 
sector slowed down somewhat , in tandem with  
manufacturing production which was affected by the 
global economic slowdown.  Employment in the 
agricultural sector, on th e other hand, expanded 
strongly  in line with growth in agricultural production . 
On the demand side , private consumption 
and i nvestment continued to expand.  This was 
largely attributable to government stimulus packages, 
accommodative monetary policy , satisfactory income 
and employment conditions, as well as fiscal stimulus 
from government spending.  However , adverse e ffects  
from the global economic slowdown on Thai exports 
amplified .  Monetary Policy Report  January 2013                      31  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The global economic slowdown caused 
exports of good s and services to grow by a mere 1.0 
percent from the previous quarter, compared to an 
expansion of 3.9 percent in 2012 Q2 (Table 2.1) .  
The decline was observed in exports of both 
manufacturing and agricultural products.   Manufacturing  
products that declined markedly included electrical 
appliances, electronics and petroleum products.  
Nevertheless, exports of automobiles and metal 
continued to expand. Meanwhile, exports of 
agricultural products fell in line with rice exports due 
to deteriorating price competitiveness.  Exports of 
rubber moderated in line with soft global demand.  
Exports of services, on the other hand, continued to 
improve from the previous quarter following a surge  
in foreign tourist s, particularly from China .  However, 
export freight and other transport  receipts  fell in line 
with lower  international trade volume.  
 Domestic demand, both private consumption 
and investment, continued to grow  robustly .  Private 
consumption expanded by 2.2 percent from the 
previous quarter following high demand growth for 
durable and non -durable goods,  in particular 
automobile s.  Supporting factors include d government  
stimulus packages, accommodative monetary policy , Source: National Economic and Social Development Board  and calculations by Bank of ThailandTable 2.1 GDP growth rate

machinery and equipment expanded following

imports .  At the same time, investment in construction 
also increased  following ongoing flood -damaged 
repairs and replacements . 
 Import s of goods and services contracted by 
2.3 percent from the previous quarter .  This was 
caused by  a slowdown in exports an d manufacturing 
production  which were  increasingly  affected by the 
global  economy.  The c ontraction in imports was  
mainly  attributable t o a fall in the imports of raw 
material and intermediate goods , especially integrated 
circuits and chemicals , as well as a slowdown in the 
volume of imported crude  oil.  Meanwhile, imports of 
consumer and capital goods  continued to expand, 
particularly the imports of food and beverages, as 
well as machinery and parts.   Imports of services, 
however,  declined from the previous quarter owing to 
the slowdown in transport payments following 
reductions in international trade transactions.  
Passenger payments also slowed down due  to a drop  
in the number of Thais travelling abroad.  
 Fiscal stimulus would co ntinue to maintain its 
role in supporting the economy as reflected by an 
expansion in government spending from the last 
quarter.  In particular, wages and salaries,  purchases 
of goods and services, as well as investment 
disbursement s for flood restoration and prevention  
and for transportation system  improvements . 
 Monetary Policy Report  January 2013                      33 The outlook on the domestic economy in 
2012  Q41/ 
The Thai economy in 2012 Q4 wa s expected 
to expand from the previous quarter  owing chiefly to 
sustained  robust  domestic demand, in private and 
public consumption and investment.  This resulted 
from government  stimulus packages, in particular tax 
rebate s for first -time car buyers , favorable employment 
conditions, as well as sat isfactory business sentiment 
towards th e Thai economy.   Moreover, although 
external  demand was still affected by the global 
economic slowdown , signs of recovery were  observed.  
Production of export -oriented industri es was thus 
expected to improve in the fourth quarter . 
Manufacturing production in 2012 Q4 was 
expected to expand from the previous quarter, both 
for export s and  domestic consumption.  Export -
oriented industries, especially the h ard disk drive 
industry , displayed clearer signs of recovery consistent  
with increasing foreign  demand.  Meanwhile, the 
integrated  circuit and parts industry  recovered 
gradually after  the flood problem subsided.  At the 
same time,  manufacturing production  for domestic 
consumption continued to expand with domestic 
                                                        
1/ Economic indicators used in assessing the outlook for  2012 
Q4 were computed by the Bank of Thailand,  except data on 
the Manufacturing Production Index  and capacity utilization 
rate, which were computed by  the Office of Industrial 
Economics. The number of  tourists and the occupancy rate 
were, in part, compiled  by the Tourism Authority of Thailand. 
Data on the  labor market were obtained from the National  
Statistical Office. The government expenditure data  were 
provided by the Comptroller General’s  Department, which 
compiled by the Fiscal Policy  Office, the Ministry of Finance. 
Economic outlook were  obtained from the Economic /Business 
Information  Exchange Program between the Bank of 
Thailand and  business sector . 34                          Monetary Policy Report  January 2013  demand, in particular automobile production which 
was expected to expand well into the first half of 
2013 . This was on account of manufacturers 
speeding up production due to high orders , given 
incentives from the first-car tax rebate scheme , as 
reflected by  the persistently high  Manufacturing 
Production Index of Vehicles  (Chart 2.8) .  Moreover, 
overall production of cement and construction 
material, as well as food and beverages expanded 
well. Improvement s in m anufacturing production 
would likely  raise  the capacity utilization rate from the 
previous quarter (Chart 2.9) .  
  In 2012 Q4, the services sector wa s expected  to 
expand strongly  in line with tourism, transportation, 
trade and construction.  The tourism  sector grew 
steadily and was not affected by the global economic 
slowdown.   The seasonal ly-adjusted  number of tourists  
was expected to increase from the last quarter, 
especially from the East Asia n region .  This increase 
in foreign tourists helped raise  the seasonally -
adjusted hotel occupancy rate (Chart 2.10) . In 
addition, the transportation and trade sectors were 
expected to expand well in line with robust domestic 
consumption. Other services sectors , such as 
construction , should also expand favorably on the 
back  of increased  private investment to support 
expansion in domestic demand , as well as 
accelerated disbursement of public investment for  
mega -projects such as  the mass rapid transit system 
project in Bangkok Metropolitan and its vicinity .  The 
real estate sector, however, was likely to contract  
from the last quarter due to accelerated investment in 
the previous period s.   
  Agricultural production in the fourth  quarter 
was likely to contract slightly f rom the previous 
quarter .  This was  because rice output  had increased  
more than usual during the past two quarters , due 
partly to price incentives from the government’s rice 1030507090110130150170190

was also expected to decline  from the previous 
quarter due to unfavorable weather conditions in the 
Northeastern region which destroyed  some crops . 
 In 2012 Q4, employment was expected to 
remain stable compared to the preceding quarter , 
resulting in a persistently  low unemployment rate 
(Chart 2.11) .  Although agricultural production was 
likely to contract slightly from the previous quarter, 
employment in this  sector would stabilize  at a high 
level.  
For the demand side, in 2012 Q4, private 
consumption and investment were likely to expand 
strongly, due partly to government stimulus  packages.  
Although exports were still affected by the global 
economic slowdown, signs of stability started to be 
observed.   
Private consumption was likely to expand 
well, as reflected by a  rise in the Private 
Consumption I ndex in October and November  2012 
(Chart 2.12) .  This was mainly attributable to higher  
imports of  consumer  goods, especially food and  
beverages, coupled with acceleration in spending in 
the automobile  sector which was consistent  with the 
hike in VAT collection . 
 Private investment was expected to grow at a 
rate close  to its normal trend, as observed from a rise 
in the Private Investment I ndex in October and 
November 2012 (Chart 2.13) .  This was attributable 
to increased investment in  machinery and equipment , 
as well as in construction to accommodate  
expansions in domestic demand and flood -damaged 
repairs still present in some industries.   Main factors 
supporting  private investment going forward included 
strong business confidence in the Thai economy as 
reflected by rising values of application and issuance 
of investment promotion certificates by the BOI and  
high level s of forei gn direct investment.     0.00.20.40.60.81.01.21.41.6

production was  likely  to lead to expansion in imports 
of goods and services (Chart 2.14) .  In particular, 
imports of automobiles and parts, capital goods , 
electronic parts, and consumer goods.  In a ddition, 
imports of services were  also likely to expand, 
particularly transport payments which were  expected 
to increase in line with import ed goods .   
 Although exports were still affected by weak 
external  demand following  global economic 
conditions, there were some signs of  stabilization 
(Chart 2.15) .  In 2012 Q4, exports of manufactured 
goods, namely integrated circuits and parts, as well 
as electrical appliances were expected to slow down.  
Exports of passenger cars  were also expected to 
decelerate , due to  manufacturers’ policy to expedite 
production for domestic customers following high 
booking .  On the other hand,  exports of agricultural 
products were expected to improve slightly from the 
previous quarter, following a rise in rice export s as 
exporters hasten ed to export rice to Nigeria before 
the tariff hike on rice import s took effect in early 2013.   
In addition, rubber prices also started to pick up .  
Meanwhile, e xports of services were expected to 
improve steadily from the previous quarter  following 
increase s in foreign tourist arrivals from almost every 
region , particularly from China and Russia.   
The public  sector would  continue to fuel  
econom ic growth  (Chart 2.16)  as reflected in the 
disbursement of government expenditures  in both 
current expenditures, especially wages and salaries  
and purchases of goods and services , as well as 
capital expenditures  on investment for the flood 
restoration and prevention program and investments 
by the Department of Highways and the Royal 
Irrigation Department.

poised to expand from the previous quarter , largely  
attributable to  growth in consumption and investment, 
both private and public, as well as in the touris m 
sector.  This was in line with  manufacturing production  
for domestic consumption which was likely to  exhibit 
continuous strong expansion .  Meanwhile, merchandise  
exports and export -oriented manufacturing production  
started  to stabilize.    
2.3 Costs and prices  
 Inflation  
Headline inflation in 2012 Q4 stood at 3.23 
percent, accelerating from 2.94 percent in the 
previous quarter due chiefly to a surge in energy 
prices (Chart 2.17) .  Energy prices increased by 
14.79 percent from the same period last year, 
accelerating sharply from 7.54 percent observed in 
the previous quarter.  This increase was caused by 1) 
a slight increase  in domestic retail oil prices following  
global oil prices ; 2) a rise in electricity fees for  
the September  to December 2012 period ; and 3)  
a low base effect due to an exemption of  oil fund levy 
last year.  
Prices of raw food in 2012  Q4 edged up by 
2.94 percent from the same period last year, but 
slowed down  from 4.80 percent in the previous 
quarter due to a drop in meat and egg prices  following 
an increase  in supply .  In addition,  prices of fruit and 
vegetables  decelerated  due to a high base effect 
caused by last year’s flood .  
 Core inflation in 2012 Q4 stood at 1.82 
percent, similar to  the pre vious  quarter (Chart 2.18) .  
Prices of food and beverages decelerated  in line with 
prepared food prices  which slowed down mainly  from

food and beverages accelerated in line with  
continuous hike s in tobacco and alcoholic beverage  
prices due to an increase in excise tax  on those items  
at the end of August 2012 .  Price acceleration in non -
food and beverages also stemmed from a low base 
effect due to  the decline in prices of public transportation  
services  in the t hird quarter of last year following 
lower domestic oil prices.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The pass -through from costs to prices in 2012

level consistent with the 5 -year average ra te. (Table

Inflation  pressure in the periods ahead   
Overall, inflation  pressure was likely to remain 
stable going forward.  
(1) Demand pressure was likely to increase 
slightly in line with robust  domestic demand , 
particularly in private consumption and investment.  
Meanwhile, exports were expected to improve steadily  
in line with  gradual global economic recovery .  
(2) Inflation expectations remained stable as 
reflected by the 12-month ahead inflation expectation 
in November 2012  of 3.3 percent, stabilizing from the 
previous month  and remain ing close to its 5-year 
average (Chart 2.20). 
(3) Going forward, c ost pressures were  likely 
to weaken slightly in line with domestic raw  food 
prices .  Although domestic prices of raw food recently 
increased, it was considered a temporary factor.   
Meanwhile, world  oil and commodity prices  were 
likely to remain moderate .  
Risks to inflation that would warrant monitor ing 
going forward include effects  of the nation wide 
minimum wage hike to 300 baht  in Janu ary 2013, 
especially psychological effects , as well as the 
government’s plan to restructure energy price s which 
could be higher than assessed.

Long -term average40   Monetary Policy Report  January 2013  Outlook on Japanese economic policy after  
the December 2012 election  
During the past two decades, the Japanese econom y has been weak with chronic deflation 
(Chart 1) . Despite various stimulus efforts, for ex ample injection of money into the economic 
system via government investment and 
prolonged monetary easing including many 
years of near-zero policy interest rate and the 
asset purchase program by the Bank of Japan 
to inflate the economy, effectiveness has been 
unclear. Japan has remained weak and has entered into recession many times.  Japan is 
also faced with structural problems, such as 
aging population, labor shortages and decrease in competitiveness of the manufacturing sector. 
These factors are key to the economic 
downturn and have not yet been resolved. During the latter half of 2012, Japan has once again entered a recession following the impact of the 
euro area debt problem on the global economy, and historical strengt hening of the yen. 
In the December 2012 general election, the former  opposition party (Liberal Democratic Party – 
LDP) led by Shinzo Abe won a landslide victory. The LDP has then formed a coalition government with 
the New Komeito party with a two-third majority  in the senate, which would ease subsequent budget 
formulation and policy implementation. In this regard, in the election campaign, the LDP announced 
various policies to take Japan out of deflation. Notable ones include: 
1. Fiscal policy 
The new government would stimulate the economy by increasing public spending. It is expected 
that additional budget of around 7-13 trillion yen, or equi valent to about 1.5-2.5 percent of GDP would 
be announced in 2013 Q1. A ten-year plan for infrastructu re investment is also expected. Furthermore, 
the government would likely postpone a hike in c onsumption tax initially planned for April 2014 should 
economic outlook remain weak, and reduce the cor porate income tax rate from the current 38 
percent
1/. 
2. Monetary policy The new government would tend to favor great er monetary easing to resolve the deflation 
problem whereby the medium- and long-term infl ation target could be increased from 1 to 2 
percent in order to raise long-term inflation ex pectation. In this regard, Bank of Japan would 
consider this proposal in its monetary policy committee meeting in January 2013. To achieve the 
proposed inflation target, analysts and investors ex pect that Bank of Japan would implement the 
following additional measures. (1) Conduct an open- ended asset purchase program.  (2) Increase

the types of private assets the Bank of Japan can purchase. (4) Establish a public-private joint 
fund to purchase foreign bonds in  order to weaken the yen. 
In this regard, should the government succeed in  implementing these policies, the short-term 
outlook of the Japanese economy would likely brighten. However, in the medium- and long-term, the 
government still faces various threats that coul d restrict policy implementation as follows.  
• The prolonged high fiscal deficit  would further increase public debt from the current level of 235 
percent of GDP.2/ Looking ahead, the absence of a plan to reduce public debt would heighten 
the risk of the economy being down-graded.  
• Demand for as well as ability to hold governm ent bonds of the private sector is limited  as  
(i) commercial banks’ balance sheets would be at  risk following a potential loss from holding 
such bonds should yields increase. At pr esent, Japanese commercial banks’ holding of 
government bond is around 24 percent of total assets, which is high compared to other 
advanced economies3/ 
(ii) households’ demand for such bonds would lik ely decline in line with the trend of aging 
population where incentive to save lessens.  
• Risk from reliance on foreign investors for liquidity remains  as foreign holdings of Japanese 
assets normally fluctuate with the economic out look and investors’ confidence. In addition, a 
deterioration of Japan’s fiscal sustainability could al so prompt these investors to decrease their 
holdings of Japanese assets. 
• Bank of Japan would likely face greater po litical pressure from the new government including the 
change in inflation target. In this regard, most inve stors view that the tar get of 2 percent would be 
too high for Japan (the average inflation rate over the past ten years is -0.2 percent), posing a 
significant risk of a below-target performance in  the medium- and long-term thereby affecting 
Bank of Japan’s policy implementation. 
Furthermore, focusing on demand-led stimulus coul d only boost the economy in the short-term 
while restrictions remain in the long-term. Ther efore, a sustainable solution for Japan would be to 
address weaknesses in the economic structure, fo r example, by restruct uring the tax and pension 
systems, resolving the problem of labor shortages, and implement ing measures to strengthen the 
manufacturing sector.  
Nevertheless, the government’s display of commitment towards fiscal and monetary stimulus 
measures has caused the yen to weaken. In a way, such development would be beneficial for the 
export sector and increase Japan’s co mpetitiveness. However, many po licies still remain unclear both 
in terms of detail and likelihood of implementation. These factors would deter mine the outlook of the 
yen as well as Japan’s economic re covery in 2013 and subsequent periods.

3.1 Financial m arkets  
Interest rates in the money and bond markets 
adjusted downward in line with the policy rate cut as 
well as global financial market  and bond supply  
conditions .  Investor confidence improved partly as a 
result of monetary easing measures in advanced 
economies.  Thus, foreign investment in the bond 
and equity markets increased and led to some 
strengthening of the baht.   
Money and bond markets  
In 2012 Q4, short -term interest rates initially 
fell then began to stabilize in line wi th a policy rate 
cut by 25 basis points  to 2.75 percent per annum on 
17 October 2012 and subsequent decisions to hold 
the policy rate  on 28 November 2012 a nd 9 January 
2013, respectively  (Chart 3.1) .  Thailand’s overall financial stability improved thanks to better sentiment in 
the financial markets which was partly due to additional monetary easing by 
advanced economies. Improvement  in investor confidence also led to rising 
investment in the bond and equity markets. Stability in other sectors, namely 
financial institutions, household, and corporate was also well maintained. While 
there was no immediate risk to fiscal stability, looki ng ahead, the ratio of public 
debt to GDP could rise following the increase in government spending.  
Going forward, key risks to be monitored included (1) the impact of 
monetary easing in the US together with monetary and fiscal stimulus measures 
in Japan o n volatility in Thai financial markets and the Thai baht; (2) uncertainties 
in the global economic recovery that could affect future corporate and household 
income; and (3) the persistent high growth in consumer credits, especially auto 
leasings and other personal loans.

moved in tandem  with global financial market 
conditions and bond supply.  At the beginning of the 
quarter, bond yields fell due partly to inflows from 
abroad as well as a policy rate cut on 17 October 
2012 (Chart 3.2) .  Toward s the end of the quarter, 
however, yields on medium - to long -term bonds rose 
following a larger -than-usual government bond 
auction in November 2012  together with investors’ 
switch to equity investment in December 2012 as 
confidence improved after the announ cement of 
further monetary easing in the US.  
Equity market  
Thailand’s stock exchange index in 2012 Q4 
continued to increase given investors’ confidence in 
the global financial markets, Thai economic 
fundamentals  and strong corporate profitabili ty. 
Demand was mainly from foreign investors and local 
institutions whose net buy was at 3.8 and 19.9 billion 
baht, respectively.  The large increase in institutional 
investment was due to retail investors’ demand for 
Long -Term E quity Funds (LTF) and Ret irement 
Mutua l Funds (RMF) during the end of the year for 
tax deduction purpose s (Chart 3.3) . 
Looking ahead, the increase in equity prices 
would be closely monitored.  In 2012 Q4, the Price to 
Earnings (P /E) ratio stood at 16.9 , declining slightly 
from 17.4 in the previous quarter but was still higher 
than its historical (2008 Q1 –2012 Q2) average of 14.6   
(Chart 3.4) .   In addition, uncertain ty regarding  global 
economic recovery and the impact of advanced 
economies’ monetary easing measures , such as  the 
US’ QE3 and QE 3+ and Japan’s monetary and fiscal 
stimulus packages , could cause capital flow and stock 
market  volatility , which would also warrant close  
monitoring .

 In 2012 Q4, the Thai baht averaged at 30.67 
baht per US dollar, strengthening  by 2.2 per cent 
from the previous quarter . The movements were 
quite limited  within a narrow range throughout the 
quarter  (Chart 3.5) , reflecting greater stability in the 
global financial markets and more balanced inflows 
and outflows. Factors that caused the Thai baht to 
strengthen slightly in this quarter included (1) 
investors’ expectation of a continuation of monetary 
easing  in the US  following Obama’s election  victory 
(November  6, 2012); (2)  likelihood of additional 
monetary and fiscal stimulus packages in Japan 
after Shinzo Abe’s election victory  (December 16, 
2012) ; and (3) better -than-expected Chinese and 
US economic data . 
 Nevertheless, the Thai baht weakened 
against the US  dollar at several points during the first 
half of the quarter as foreign investors slowed 
investment in Asian equity and bond markets due to 
uncertainty of the US  fiscal cliff, prolonged public 
debt problem s in Europe, and demand for US dollars 
from gold traders following a continu ous decline in 
gold prices.  
 Volatility of the Thai baht was at its lowest 
level in three years (Chart 3.6)  given its stable 
movements , reflect ing greater stability in the global 
financial markets and more balanced capital flows .  
 The Nominal Effective Exchange Rate  (NEER) 
averaged at 102.73 in 2012  Q4, strengthening by 1.50 
percent from last quarter’s average (Chart 3.7)  due 
to weakening of major currencies including the U S 
dollar, the Japanese yen and the euro. The Real 
Effective Exchange Rate (REER) also moved in 
tandem with the NEER given that relative prices were 
stable throughout the quarter .  6668707274767880828486

103.1046    Monetary Policy Report January 2013  3.2 Financial institutions  
Commercial banks’ interest rates in 2012 Q4 
declined following a policy rate cut while deposits and 
credits continued to expand well.   Financial institutions 
stability remained sound overall, though the persistent 
expansion in consumer  loans , particularly other 
personal  loans and the associ ated loan quality posed 
risks that would be closely monitored, going forward.  
Interest rates, credits and deposits  
Commercial banks’ interest rates on deposits 
and loans in 2012 Q4 declined following a policy rate 
cut on 17 October 2012 after having been stable since 
the beginning of the year.   At the end of 2012 Q4, 
interest rates on the 3 -, 6-, and 12 -month deposits of 
the four largest commercial banks1/ averaged at 1.86, 
2.18, and  2.49 percent per ye ar, respectively.   
Meanwhile, the MLR stood at 7.00 percent per year. 
Monetary policy transmission through the interest rate 
channel in this quarter was fast given a more relaxed 
liquidity condition, especially of large banks compared 
to last quarter, than ks mainly to prior competition for 
deposits through special products.  
Private credits at the end of November 2012 
continued to expand markedly  at 15.7 percent (Chart 
3.8).  Corporate credit growth remained robust, which 
could be attributed to the up -cycle in investment.  
Consumer credit s also expanded significantly , 
particularly other personal loans2/ and auto leasings  
that partly stemmed from the tax rebate scheme for

Officer Survey as of end -November 2012 revealed 
that demand for private credits in 2013 Q1 from both 
corporates and households would continue to 
increase (Chart 3.9) . 
Deposits and bills of exchange (B/E) as of 
end-November 2012 expanded well at 12.1 percent 
from the same period last year, partly as a result of 
the ongoing competition for deposits  through  special 
products to replace expiring B/E and support the high 
growth in private credits.  
Stability of financial institutions   
Financial institutions ’ stability in 2012  Q4 was 
sound, as reflected by the high ratio of capital to risk -
weighted assets and strong profitability.  
The most recent balance sheets of 
commercial banks revealed a strong financial position 
overall with the ratio of capital to risk -weighted assets 
at 16.0 percent, which was almost twice the 8.5 
percent legal requirement. Moreover, liquidity 
remained abundant, as reflected by continued 
expansion in deposits and a  persistent decline in the 
loan to deposit and B/E ratio. Commercial banks’ net 
profit of 4 5.2 billion baht also echoed t he sector’s 
strong performance (Table 3.1) . 
Nevertheless, major risks that could threaten 
financial institutions ’ stability in the periods ahead 
included the persistent ly high growth in consumer 
loans, especially other persona l loans given a 
continued rise in their delinquency rate even -though 
delinquency and NPL ratios remained stable at 5.5 
percent. (Chart 3.10)

 Overall, stability of non -financial sectors was 
well maintained  as household and corporate outlook 
improved thanks to recoveries in both domestic and 
global economies.   Nonetheless, risks in the upcoming 
periods remained from acc elerating credits and 
household debt.  
Household sector   
Stability of the household sector remained 
sound overall, as reflected by high employment. 
However, the expansion in consumer loans, especially 
auto leasings  and other personal loans would be 
monitored as these could adversely impact 
households’ debt servi cing ability , going forward . 
Stability of households’ income and 
employment remained robust  thanks to high 
employment, as reflected by a low unemployment 
rate (seasonally adjusted) in November 2012 of 0.4 
percent , as well as strong farm and non -farm average 
earni ngs (Chart 3.11) .  Moreover, a business survey3/ 
on the impact of the  nationwide  300 baht minimum 
wage policy on employment conditions revealed that 
there was no sign of a widespread lay -off as most 
businesses still experienced labor shortage due to 
tight labor market conditions.  
Meanwhile, households’ financial conditions 
remained s trong, as evident from liquidity, measured 
by the ratio of debt to financial assets of households 
in 2012 Q3, which continued to be low at 45.9 
percent (Chart 3.12) , and overall loan quality, as 
reflected by the ratio of delinquent and non -
performing loans  to total loans , which also remained 
low at 4.8 percent .

2012 Monetary Policy Report January  2013                    49 Although there was no apparent sign of an 
imbalance in the household sector, two key risks that 
would require close monitoring in the  following  
periods included:  
 (1) the persistent expansion in consumer 
loans, particularly auto leasings  and other personal 
loans, partly stemming from government  stimulus 
measures, which could adversely impact households’ 
debt servicing  ability and loan quality , especially in 
the low -income group; and  
 (2) risk of worsening employment outlook, 
resulting from the impact of global economic 
uncertainties on the Thai economy as well as the 
impact of the 300 baht minimum wage policy on 
employment level.  
Corporate sector  
In 2012 Q3, overall corp orate performance 
remained healthy.  However, risks that could affect 
corporate stability in the periods ahead included the 
impact of global economic uncertainties on the Thai 
economy, particularly the export sector, and cost 
pressures ar ising from the 300 baht minimum wage 
policy , which would take full effect in the beginning of 
2013.  
Overall performance of non -financial 
companies  listed on the stock e xchange of Thailand 
remained healthy.  The median of firms’ operating 
profit margin (OPM ), which reflected profitability, 
stood at 7.0 percent, increasing slightly from 6.9 
percent in the last quarter. Meanwhile, debt servicing 
ability and liquidity remained high, as reflected by the 
median of firms’ interest coverage (ICR) ratio of 3.7 
and t he median of firms’ de bt to equity (D/E) ratio of 
0.9, respectively, which remained stable from the 
previous quarter.  
Looking ahead, corporate profitability was 
expected to remain robust following expansion in 50    Monetary Policy Report January 2013  domestic demand and a more stable Thai export 
outlook in line with regional developments  (Chart 
3.13) .  However, risks that could affect corporate 
stability in the periods ahead included the impact of 
global economic uncertainties on the Thai economy 
and corporate sector, especially export -oriented  
industries, and higher cost pressures stemming from 
the government’s wage policy and labor shortages, 
particularly in the manufacturing and construction 
sectors.  
Real estate sector  
The real estate sector experienced some 
slowdown towards year -end after  a continu ous 
expansion from the beginning of the year.  Prices in 
some areas accelerated markedly  though  no broad -
based concern was noted. Factors that needed close 
monitoring in the next periods included higher 
production costs and labor shortages which could 
affect construction projects  as well as prices.  
 Thailand’s overall real estate activities 
expanded continuously from the beginning of the 
year, especially the low -rise housing sector, which 
improved notably from both the demand and supply 
sides dur ing the second half of 2012 (Chart 3.14) , 
partly owing to the return of buyers’ and firms’ 
confidence following recovery from the flood.  
Nonetheless, some slowdown was noted towards 
year-end after experiencing strong acceleration  in the 
previous periods .  Housing demand, as reflected by 
the three -month moving average of the  number of 
approved  mortgages from banks (Bangkok and its 
vicinity) in November 2012 declined from the 
previous month. On the supply side, firms slowed  
new openings in Bangkok and its vicinity, especially 
condominiums, given that a large number of projects 
had already been launched du ring the first half of the 
year (Table 3.1) .  8090100110120

2012Monetary Policy Report January  2013                    51 Risk of a real estate bubble declined as 
prices of all types of housings had been stabilizing  
since the beginning of 2012 Q4  (Chart 3.15) .  The 
continuous acceleration in prices from 2012 Q2, 
particularly for condominiums, was not a threat since 
it had been in line with rising costs such as higher 
land prices due to the expansi on of public 
transportation networks as well as wages.   Moreover, 
banks’ credit standards were at a normal level and 
borrowers ’ debt serv icing ability  was satisfactory , as 
reflected by the debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) 
median of 4.7 in November 2012, which was higher 
than banks’ lending practice of 2.0 (Chart 3.16) . 
However, risks that required monitoring in the 
periods ahead included rising costs owing to higher 
prices of land and construction materials, a wage 
hike, and labo r shortages. All these costs could 
impact housing construction, prices  and foreign 
investment  in the real estate sector  in the following  
periods.  
Fiscal sector  
Stability of the fiscal sector was well 
maintained but the ratio of public debt to GDP could 
increase, going forward, owing to higher public 
spending.  
Stability of the fiscal sector was well 
maintained, as reflected by the ratio of public debt to 
GDP as of October 2012 that stabilized from the end 
of last fiscal year (September 2012) (Chart 3.17)  and 
remained well below the threshold for fiscal 
sustainability of 60.0 percent.  
Nevertheless, looking ahead, public spending 
would likely  continue rising  from a persistent  budget  
deficit  owing to ongoing fiscal stimulus measures, for 
example the first-car tax rebate scheme, off -balance 
sheet funding and spending such as the rice pledging 
scheme, the water management project and Chart  3.15 Housing price index

 Monetary Policy Report  January 2013    55  The 300 baht minimum wage policy  and its economic impact  
The government started  to implement the m inimum wage policy hike on April  1, 2012, which led to 
a 40 percent rise in minimum wage across all provinces. Later on, a second round increase  took place  on 1 
January 2013, raising  the nationwide minimum wage leve l to 300 baht.  No further minimum wage increase  
would be authorized until 2015.  Analysis of t he first round of increase shows  no sign of impact on overall 
economic stability.   Unemployment has stabilized at a low level (Chart 1)  while the increase in labor cost has 
neither led to a higher -than-normal pass -through to prices nor create d significant inflation  pressure (Chart 2) . 
 
However, the minimum wage hike  has led to a shift in the overall earnings structure, causing 
country -wide private average earnings in 2012  Q2 – Q3 to increase  by 17.3 percent from the same period  last 
year – higher than the usual rise  of 5.9 percent ( taking the average over  the last five years1/).  The increase in 
average earnings has helped stimulate private consumption and encouraged businesses to improve 
production efficiency , for example, by  substituting labor input with technology.  As a result, the country’s 
overall economic potential has risen.  
The i mpact of the first round of minimum wage increase has been  trivial  due to the following  factors : 
1. Some businesses have  already been paying wage close to the designated level.   In addition, the 
service s sector, for example, hotel businesses have been  able to include service charge as part of wage.  
2. Businesses’ overall profit margin after incorporat ing in the minimum wage increase has 
remained healthy .  Businesses  have  also been compensated by a corporate income tax rate cut from 30 to 23 
percent in 2012.   However, taking a micro -level perspective, businesses that have been greatly affected are  
Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), especially those  in the manufacturing sector in provinces which had  
minimum wage less than 250 baht , as well as  trading firms  (except large businesses in the seven pilot 
provinces2/).

continuously to cushion the impact and maintain profitability. Trading firms in seventy  provinces (not including 
the seven  pilot provinces) have formed groups to order products in larger  quantit ies and used different 
promotion strategies from that of  the distribution centers to allow higher turnovers. Meanwhile, manufacturing 
businesses have adjusted by 1)  invest ing in new machineries to upgrade production efficiency and replace 
human labor, especially  in agricultural processing , plastic and furniture manufacturing firms; 2) improving and 
streamlining production processes in textile, apparel and electrical appliance manufacturing firms; 3) 
increasing usage of finished parts, for example, in construction and real estate firms and 4) hiring  based on 
output, for example,  in textile, apparel and agricultural processing firms.  All these adjustment s have helped 
lessen the impact of the wage hike, thereby allowing  business es to continue operation.  
4. The labor market has been  tight. Against the backdrop of strong domestic demand, employment  
has continued to remain  high in many industries.  Moreover, businesses have been  more concerned about 
labor shortage than higher costs so they have gradually increased wage to the legal minimum  level or even 
higher to attract and retain workers. Despite layoffs in some firms that experienced lower profitabi lity, stronger 
firms have been  able to absorb these workers. Some workers  also decided to start  their own or return to 
family businesses. The unemployment rate has thus remained low.   
Outlook on the impact of  hiking minimum wage to 300 baht in the second round of increase3/: 
o Outlook on overall profitability.  Analysis  shows  that the second round of minimum wage 
increase together with a reduction in corporate income tax rate from 23 to 20 percent in 2013 wou ld still affect 
the same groups , namely SMEs  in the manufacturing sector  in provinces which had minimum wage  less than 
250 baht , and the trading sector  (except large businesses in the seven pilot provinces).  However, under tight 
labor market conditions and strong domestic demand, labor shortage would still be experienced in o ther 
businesses. Therefore, it could be expected that such businesses would be able to absorb these  layoffs.  
o  The impact on overall price stability should also be small as was the case for the first round of 
increase.  Under intense competition, price adjustments would be difficult (Chart 3) .  Hence, higher labor cost 
would neither pass -through to prices nor increase 
inflation  pressure significantly.  
In any case,  the impact of the seco nd round 
of minimum wage increase would continue to be 
closely monitored, particularly in the aforementioned 
risky businesses , SMEs with thinner profit margin and 
adjustment restrictions, as well as  businesses in the 
seven pilot provinces that might need t o increase 
wage s again to retain workers, which could put 
pressure on wage adjustments and induce further 
shifts in the overall earnings structure.  
                                                        
3/ The nationwide minimum wage increase to 300 baht would cause businesses in 70 provinces to  raise wage between  9.9 
to 35.1 percent, averaging at 22 percent.   Some provinces such as Phayao, Sisaket, Nan, Tak and Surin  would need to 
hike minimum wage up by 33.7 percent from the previous rate. When combined with the first round of increase  
(40 percent from the previous rate), these provinces would need to increase wage  on average  by 86.6 percent in total.
