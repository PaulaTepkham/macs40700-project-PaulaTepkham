Monetary Policy Report  
 
 
The Monetary Policy Report  is prepared quarterly by staff of the 
Bank of Thailand with the approval of the Monetary Policy Committee 
(MPC).  It serves two purposes: ( 1) to communicate to the public the  
MPC’s  consideration and rationales for the conduct of monetary policy, 
and (2)  to present the latest set of  economic and inflation forecast s, based 
on which  the monetary policy decisions  were made .

Monetary Policy Report  September  2016 
Monetary Policy in Thailand  
Monetary Policy Committee  
Under the Bank of Thailand Act, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) comprise s the 
governor and two deputy governors, as well as four distinguished external members  
representing various sectors of the economy , with the aim of ensuring  that monetary policy 
decisions are effective and transparent.  
Monetary Policy Objective  
The MPC sets monetary policy to promote  the objective of supporting sustainable a nd full 
potential economic growth, without causing inflationary problems or economic and financial 
imbalances or bubbles.  
Monetary Policy Target  
The Cabinet  approved the annual average headline inflation target of 2.5 + 1.5 percent as the 
target for 2016 and for the medium  term. The inflation target  is to assure the general public 
that the MPC will take necessary policy actions to return headline inflation to the target within 
an appropriate time horizon without jeopardi zing growth and macro -financial stability.  In the 
event that headline inflation deviates from the target, the MPC shall explain the reasons 
behind the target breach to the  Minister  of Finance and the  public, together with measures 
taken and estimated time to bring inflation back to the target.  
Monetary Policy Instrument   
The MPC utilizes the 1 -day bilateral repurchase transaction rate as the policy interest rate to 
signal the monetary policy stance.  
Evaluati on of Economic Conditions and Forecasts  
The Bank of Thailand takes into account  information from all sources, the macroeconomic 
model, data from each economic sector, as well as surveys  of large enterprises , together with  
small and medium -sized  enterprises from all over the country,  and various financial institutions  
to ensure that economic evaluations and forecasts are accurate and cover all aspects, both at 
the macro and micro levels.   
Monetary Policy Communication  
Recognizing the importance  of monetary policy communication to the public, the MPC 
employs  various  channel s of communication, both in Thai and English, such as (1) organizing 
a press statement at 14 :00 on the day of the Committee meeting, (2) publishing edited 
minutes of the MPC meeting two weeks after the meeting, and (3) publishing the Monetary 
Policy Report  every quarter.  Monetary Policy Report  September  2016

 The Thai economy is projected to expand slightly faster than assessed in 
the previous Monetary Policy Report  thanks to the higher -than-expected growth 
in private consumption in the second quarter of 2016. Th is positive development  
helps compensate for  the contraction in merchandise export s owing to a projected 
slowdown in trading partners’ economies post -Brexit and Thailand’s own 
structural problems in the export sector. For 2017, the Thai economy is expected 
to grow at about the same rate  as this year, driven mainly by private consumption 
and public spending  and also by expansion in tourism.  
Core inflation in 20 16 and 2017 is expected to remain  unchan ged from the 
previous estimate. I ncreased demand pressures from the economic recovery are 
offset  by a decline in costs because of lower oil prices resulting from  weaker global 
demand. Headline inflation is revised do wn in line with a downward revision in the  
crude oil price forecast . While the Committee expects headline inflation to return 
to the lower bound of the target band within this year, the timing would largely 
depend on movements  in global crude oil prices.  
The Committee  maintain ed the policy interest rate in the August and 
September  meetings. T he overall econom ic outlook remains largely unchanged 
from the meetings in the preceding  quarter. The economy is expected to recover 
at a gradual  pace  and inflation is  projected to return to the target band, with 
monetary conditions continuing to be  accommodative . While a potential increase 
in risk accumulation under the prolonged low interest rate environment  continues 
to warrant close monitoring,  financial stability r emains sound .  Nevertheless, after 
Brexit  the Thai economy is faced with greater risks on the external front, which 
will affect the outlook of Thailand’s trading partners and overall confidence . While 
there is a high degree of uncertainty associated with t hese risks , their 
consequences can be severe should they materialize. The Committee thus 
emphasizes the need to preserve policy space , continuing to  monitor and assess 
risks to  the economic outlook  in order to formulate appropriate monetary policy.   Monetary Policy Report September 2016          2 1.1 Growth and inflation prospects  
The Committee revise s the GDP growth 
forecast for 2016  from 3.1 to 3.2  percent (Table 
1.1) mostly on account of  higher -than -expected 
growth in the first half of the year  that was  
particularly  contributed by  private consumption. 
The strong consumption growth  is due  to the  
easing  of the drought, together with  temporary 
boost s from government stimulus measures to 
stimulate  private consumption as well as  
accelerated purchases  of durable goods following 
the launch of new car models and promotional  
campaigns.  Although growth is likely to 
moderate somewhat i n the second half of the 
year from the first half with  short -term 
gover nment stimulus measures expiring, t he 
economy is expected to  continue to  expand  
albeit at a gradual pace . Growth will be supported 
by the gradual improvement in  farm income , as the  
impact of the  drought  subside s, and also driven by  
disbursement of public spending  that has been 
well-maintained . These positive factors  will help 
underpin private spending , thereby providing 
support for  the overall economy  given that  
merchandise exports have yet to recover  and 
exports  of services  experience  a setback  in the 
short term  from the government’s attempt to curb 
zero-dollar tour s and the bombing  incidents  in the 
seven provinces  in Southern Thailand  in August.  
The Thai economy is projected to grow  
in 2017 at about the same rate as in this year . 
Domestic demand will remain a key driver of growth 
on the back of continuity of government policies  
after the draft constitution was approved  in the 
referendum. In particular , new investment in 
transportation infrastructure such as the dual -track 
railway  and Bangkok Mass Transit projects are

Tourism is expected to return to normal after the 
adverse impact s of explosions  in the southern 
provinces  and the crackdown on zero -dollar  
tour operators  diminish . Nonetheless,  growth 
momentum of merchandise e xports  is likely to 
remain  limited  and will continue to weigh on the 
economic recovery given weaker -than-expected  
growth in trading partners’ economies  and 
structural problems  in Thailand’s  export sector .  
The Committee therefore decided to maintain  
the growth forecast for 2017 at 3.2 percent  
(Table 1.1) . 
Overall macroeconomic i mprovements i n 
2016 and a continued expansion in 2017 will induce 
higher demand pressure s as reflect ed by the 
narrowing  of the  output gap over the forecast 
period (Chart 1.1) . Meanwhile, cost-push 
inflationary pressures  decline , as lower crude oil  
prices  and domestic energy prices are transmitted 
to other goods and services . The Committee 
therefore maintain s the core inflation  forecast  for 
2016 and 2017 at 0.8 and 1.0 percent , respectively . 
However, the Committee revises  down  the 
headline inflation forecast or 2016 and 2017 to 0.3 
and 2.0 percent , respectively,  from the previous 
assessment of 0.6 and 2.2 percent. Nonetheless,  
headline  inflation  is still projected  to return to  
the lower bound of the target  band within this 
year, the timing of which, however , depends mainly 
on global oil price movements . 
Key economic developments  that the 
Committee takes into account in preparing the 
growth and inflation forecasts  are as follow s. 
(1) Trading partners’ economies are 
expected  to grow at a slower  rate than 
previously assessed (Table 1.2), continuing  to

as of 2014 (13 countries )Monetary Policy Report September 2016          4 weigh  on Thailand’s merchandise exports over  
the period  ahead .  
The Committee revis es down  projections  of 
trading partners’ growth for      and      on 
account of (1) lower -than-expected  second -quarter 
GDP outturns , especially for the US , (2) the UK 
referendum to leave the EU (Brexit)  that will likely  
restrain growth in  the euro area amid  falling 
consumer  and business confidence due to  
increased  political uncertainties,  and (3)  impact s 
from heightened  volatility in the global financial 
markets which likely lead  to the appreciation of the 
US dollar and the Japanese yen. Such appreciatio n 
will weigh on  the economic recover y of the US and 
Japan, which in turn will affect the Chinese  and 
Asian economies.  
The lower -than-expected trading partners ’ 
growth is an important factor that restrains Thai 
exports  in the period ahead , further exacerbating  
the contraction of most  merchandise  export s. 
However , the value of  gold export s, which  has risen  
on the back of  the recent increase s in gold prices 
post-Brexit, will help  compensat e for the 
contraction of other merchandise export s. The 
Committee therefore maintain s the forecast of  
export value  at -2.5 percent  in 2016 . For 2017, 
the Committee revise s down  the export value 
from zero growth to a contraction of 0.5 percent 
in anticipation of  increasingly  greater  impact s 
from Brexit going for ward (Table 1.3 in the 
Appendix to Chapter 1 ). The subdued outlook for 
merchandise exports suggests low growth for 
production and employment in export -oriented 
manufacturing  industries , thereby affecting 
household spending and business investment 
decision s.  
Moreover,  major advanced economies are 
likely to maintain very accommodative policy for a Monetary Policy Report September 2016          5 longer period of time (“low for longer ”) given the 
slow global economic recovery . The Federal 
Reserve is expected to continue monetary policy 
easing for longer than previously assessed while 
awaiting to further evaluat e global financial  
conditions and the impact of Brexit  before  being 
expected to raise  the federal funds rate in 
December 2016, a s opposed to September 2 016 in 
the previous assessment. Meanwhile, the  Bank of 
England eased  monetary policy further at the 
August meeting by cutting  the policy rate, 
purchasing government and corporate bonds,  and 
introducing  the Term Funding Scheme (TFS). The 
Bank of Japan also continues  with monetary policy 
easing  through the negative interest rate policy  and 
Quantitative and Qualitative Easing (QQE). The 
uncertainty in monetary policy directions of major 
advanced economies  would further contribute to 
capital flow and exchange rate  volatility in the 
period ahead.  
The Committee assesses  risks to growth of  
Thailand’s trading partners to be tilted to the 
downside due to greater uncertainty post-Brexit. In 
particular, the trade and investment agree ment 
negotiations between the UK  and the EU will have  
significant implicatio ns for  global  trade and long-
term global economic  recovery. In addition, the 
following risks to trading partners’ economic 
recover y warrant close monitoring : (1) uncertain ty 
in monetary policy direction s of major  advanced 
economies; (2) political uncertainty in the US with 
the upcoming presidential election in November; 
(3) possibl e increase  in political uncertainty in 
Europe after elections in several countries 
especially France, Italy , and the Netherlands , and 
(4) risk s in the Chinese financial  sector from high 
corporate debt  levels . These risks can heighten  
global financial volatility and may affect the real 
econom y more than expected.  Monetary Policy Report September 2016          6 (2) Growth momentum from t ourism 
may be more modest than expected, especially  
in 2016 , due to (1) the  actual  number of foreign 
tourists in the second quarter grew less than 
expected;      trading partners’ growth was also 
lower than previously assessed , although the 
impact was  likely  limited to European tourists a nd 
less so for Chin ese tourists who constitute a major 
share in the tourist market; (3) short -term setback 
in the number of tourists after the bombing 
incidents  in August, although  a rapid rebound is 
expected as with other incidents in the  past (Chart 
1.2), and (4) the government’s attempt to curb zero-
dollar tour s that aims to  regulate  Chinese tour  
operators , which can lead to some decline in the 
number of Chinese tourists in the fourth quarter in 
2016 and the first quarter in 2017 . Consequently, 
the Committee projects  the number of foreign 
tourists in 2016 and 2017 to be  33.6 and 36.3 
million s, slightly down from the previous estimate at 
34.0 and 36.7 million s, respectively . 
Furthermore,  the tourism sector faces 
additional  short -term risks  stem ming  from (1) the 
recent bombing incidents that may deteriorate 
tourist confidence more than expected  and (2) 
regulation to set a minimum price for tour packages 
which is expected to come into effect in 2017 that  
may trim down the projected number of Chinese 
tourists  who constitute the major tourist group for 
Thailand, constituting a significant risk going 
forward . 
(3) The increase in global crude oil 
prices is likely  to be slower than expected 
throughout the assessment period (Chart 1.3) , 
leading  to a downward revision of Thailand’s 
headline inflation . The Committee revises  down 
the assumption on Dubai oil pri ce over  the forecast  
period , from the average of 41.0 and 50.0 US

from the previous assessment  of 43.1 and 53.0 US 
dollars per barrel,  respectively. This is on account 
of weak global demand from the slower -than-
expected global economic recovery . Concurrently, 
supply  conditions remain  unchanged from the 
previous assessment  as OPEC production  is 
expecte d to slow down slightly due to production 
outages  in many countries , while production in 
Non-OPEC countries remain s low despite the fact 
that shale oil producers in the US are likely to raise 
production  levels as prices gradually increase.   
Lower oil prices compared with 
previous projection ha ve allow domestic costs 
of goods and services, especially in 
transportation, to stabilize at a low level, 
resulting in lower -than -expected  headline 
inflation . Moreover, low oil prices also suppress 
price s of oil -related exports and imports.  Given 
that oil imports constitute a significant  share of 
Thailand’s total imports , together with the fact that 
import of capital goods are lower compared with the 
previous Monetary Policy Report , the value of 
imports declines more than that of exports. As a 
result, the current account in 2016 and 2017 is 
expected to record  a larger surplus of 40.4 and 
31.8 billion U.S. dollars , up from the previous 
estimates of 37.8 and 32.3 billion U.S. dollars,  
respectively.  
Looking ahead,  global oil prices are 
posing larger downside risks to the baseline 
forecast . Factors that may lead  to an 
underestimation of oil prices include (1) lower -than-
expected global oil demand due to a slow global 
economic recovery, (2) crude oil supply from shale 
oil producers that may rebound more quickly than 
expected once prices are higher, and (3) crude oil 
supply from major oil exporting countries that may Monetary Policy Report September 2016          8 be larger than expected as they increase 
production to maintain market shares. On the other 
hand, upside risk affecting the baseline forecast 
may stem from (1) unrests in the Middle East  that 
can spread to major oil production areas and   
(2) negotiations between OPEC and  non-OPEC 
producers in September. If an agreement on 
production  freeze is reached, prices will likely rise 
in the future.  
(4) Public sector disbursement is higher 
than previously assessed following the 
referendum result to accept the draft 
constitution.  Government expenditure in 2016 is 
slightly lower than predicted as the outturn in the 
second quarter shows  a lower -than-expected 
investment by state -owned enterprises  (SOEs) . 
The total figure for 2016  can be partly  compensated  
for by the government’s measure to expedite 
budget  disbursement in the last quarter of this year.  
In 2017, expedited carry -over expenditure in 
accordance with the Transfer of Expenses Budget 
Act, B.E. 2559 will continue supporting robust 
public expenditure. M oreover, the approval of the 
draft constitution will allow the government to push 
through investment projects  with a clearer timeline , 
especially those in transportation infrastructure 
whose projects are scheduled to launch in the 
beginning of 2017 such as  the dual-track rail and 
Bangkok Mass Transit projects.  Increased 
government expenditure, an up ward trend in public 
investment , and the materialization of the public -
private partnership (PPP) in the Pink Route and 
Yellow Route rail construction projects will 
encourage  confidence and support private 
investment in 2017.  
(5) Recent economic developments above 
are key factors in supporting a gradual recovery 
of private consumption . In the second half of Monetary Policy Report September 2016          9 2016, private consumption growth may slow down 
somewhat  after having accelerated in the second 
quarter. In 2017, private consumption is expected  
to recover slowly supported by (1) robust income 
growth  in the service sector , (2) farm income that is 
improving but remain at a low level, and (3) lower 
costs of living due to lower oil prices. Meanwhile, 
the recovery of income in export -oriented 
manufacturing sectors remains  restrained by 
weaker global growth  and structural limitations 
facing the  Thai export  sector . 
(6) Private investment projection is 
lower than expected  due to (1) subdued 
merchandise exports , and (2) the economic 
recovery  which still possess a high degree of 
uncertainty despite benefiting from the gradual 
recovery in consumption and steady growth in 
exports of services . However, private investmen t 
remains concentrated in some business  sectors  
such as retail sale and telecommunications. 
Nevertheless , PPP will partly support private 
investment starting from the end of 2016 onwards.  
In summary, Thailand’s  economic 
growth  in 2016 has improved compared with 
the previous assessment  on account of better -
than-expected growth outturns in the second 
quarter, especially in private consumption. 
However, growth is held back by the lower -than-
expected recover y of trading partners’ economies 
and tourism that is affected by the bombing 
incidents in August and the government ’s attempt 
to curb zero-dollar tour s. Growth in 2017 is 
consistent with the previous assessment. The 
slower -than-expected trading partners’ economic 
growth is comp ensated for by continually increased  
government expenditure, particularly public 
investment, in line with the expedited disbursement 
measure and improved policy certainty.  Monetary Policy Report September 2016          10 Risks to Growth and Inflation Forecasts  
The Committee view s risks to growth to 
remain tilted toward the downside. Over the 
forecast horizon, the growth fan chart is 
skewed down more than previously assessed 
(Chart 1.4). Compared with  the previous Monetary 
Policy Report , increased downside risks mainly 
stem from the impact from Brexit that will restrain 
the global economic recover y. Other risks to be 
closely monitored include (1) risks in the Chinese 
financial sector , (2) the private sector’s limited 
ability to cope with economic shock s, and (3) 
impact s on tourism  from measure s to curb zero-
dollar tour s and bombings  in the seven  provinces.  
On the contrary , upside risks to the growth 
forecast are (1) government expenditure in 
investment projects that may  be carried out more 
quickly and with larger -than-expected outlays , and 
(2) the positive effect  from government measures 
that may be higher than expected. With regard to 
inflation, the Committee judges the balance of 
risks on both headline and core inflation 
forecasts to be tilted to the downside in line 
with the balance of risks to growth ( Chart 1.5 
and 1.6).

In the third qua rter of 2016, monetary policy 
remain ed accommodative to support the economic 
recovery that continued to face greater downside 
risks on the external front . The Committee 
emphasize d the need to preserve policy space 
given that external risks still possessed a high 
degree of uncertainty  but could significantly affect  
the ongoing economic recovery . Hence, the 
Committee will continue to closely monitor and 
evaluate risk developments going forward . 
At the MPC meeting on Aug ust 3, 2016  the 
Committee voted unanimously to maintain the 
policy rate at 1.50 percent. The Committee 
assessed the Thai economy to continue 
expand ing at a pace close to the assessment in 
the previous meeting  but faces greater  
downside risks  from h eightened uncertainties in 
the global economy post -Brexit . These included the 
trade and investment between the UK and the EU , 
as well as concerns over the European financial 
sector and political de velopments  abroad . 
Nonetheless, results obtained from a scenario 
analysis suggest ed that different Brexit scenarios 
can lead to  varying economic consequences  and 
their corresponding policy responses.  Such 
exercise will be benefi cial to formulating an 
appropriate policy decision going forward should 
the situation deviate from the baseline . Meanwhile, 
headline inflation was projected to return to the 
lower bound of the target  band with in the 
second half of the year , but there remai ned 
risks  from weak demand and lower -than-expected 
energy prices. Specifically, the timing of the return 
of headline inflation to the target band would 
depend  mainly  on global oil price movements.  Monetary Policy Report September 2016          12 Monetary conditions remained eased 
and conducive  to economic recovery.  Financing 
costs remained low as reflected in negative real 
interest rate s. Meanwhile, t otal corporate financing  
and household credit continued to expand, 
although some businesses still faced limitations in 
obtaining credit amid the gradual economic 
recovery. Nevertheless, the baht strengthened 
over the recent periods, which might not be 
beneficial to the economic recovery as much as 
it could.  
The Committee viewed that overall 
economic conditions in Thailand  did not 
significantly change f rom the previous meeting , 
but the economy faced greater downside risks 
from uncertainties abroad. The decision to keep 
the policy rate on hold at  this meeting was 
therefore  to preserve policy space  in order to 
cushion potential impact that cou ld hinder the 
ongoing economic recovery. Going forward, the 
Committee will continue to monitor risks and 
assess potential impact s as to formulate the 
appropriate policy response . In addition, the 
Committee noted that, under  the prolonged low 
interest rate environment,  monetary policy  must 
take into account financial stability risks from the 
search -for-yield behavior  that may lead to the  
underpricing of risks and  accumulat ion of 
imbalances in the financial system , all of which 
continued to warrant  close monitoring . 
At the following meeting on September 14, 
2016, the Committee voted unanimously to 
maintain the policy rate at 1.50 percent. In 
deliberating  their decision, the Committee 
assessed  that the Thai economy recorded 
higher -than -expected growth in th e second 
quarter on the back of a strong expansion in 
private consumption , partly as a result of Monetary Policy Report September 2016          13 temporary factors including car promotional 
campaigns and government stimulus measures 
during the holiday periods . Meanwhile, tourism  and 
public spending remai ned the key drivers of growth . 
Headline inflation rose slightly from an increase 
in fresh food prices and was expected to return 
to the lower bound of the target band by the end 
of this year in line with the previous  
assessment . Monetary conditions also remained 
accommodative and conducive to the economic 
recovery.  
In deliberati ng their decision, the 
Committee gave due considerations to  the Thai 
economy which would continue to recover 
despite the fact that growth momentum  may 
moderate  slightly in the second half of the year after 
a strong acceleration due to  temporary factors in 
earlier periods. In 2017, the economy would  
continue to expand, as reflect ed in  the closing of 
the output gap that pick ed up pace compared with 
the previous estimate. Concurrently, headline 
inflation was projected to gradually return to the 
target  band  within this year.  
However, going forward, there remain ed 
risks from the fragile global economic recovery 
especially from and political  uncertainties abroad 
as well as domestic risks such as the impact of 
government regulations to curb zero-dollar tour s. 
The Committee therefore emphasize d the need to 
preserve policy space and w ould continue to 
closely monitor risk developments.  
Overall monetary condition s were 
accommodative and conducive to economic 
recovery as real interest rates and bond yields 
remained low. The recent slowdown in commercial 
bank credit growth was mainly caused by demand 
constraints. However, the Committee assessed 
that the recent appre ciation of the Thai baht Monetary Policy Report September 2016          14 might not be beneficial for growth and there 
remained  uncertainties that might affect the 
movement of the Thai baht going forward.  In 
particular, monetary polic y of major advanced 
economies in the low -for-longer environment can 
contribute to greater capital and exchange rate 
volatility . Notwithstanding, Thailand's strong 
external  stability w ould help the economy cope with 
the increase d volatility. However , it can also attract 
more fund flow that w ould exert additional pressure 
on exchange rates.  
In addition , the Committee assessed that 
overall financial stability remained sound  but 
there remained pockets of risks. These 
included the search -for-yield behavior under 
the prolonged low interest rate environment 
and de clining credit qu ality in some business 
sector s. The latter was particularly pertinent to 
small -and-medium -sized enterprises ( SMEs ), 
which financial institutions remained cautious in 
extending credit to .  
Going forward, the Committee affirm  that 
monetary policy  should continue to be 
accommodative. The Committee stand ready to 
utilize appropriate policy tools so that overall 
monetary conditions will remain conducive to 
economic recovery and financial stability .

 The global economy in the second quarter grew at a slower pace due to 
a slowdown in major economies. Going forward, the slowdown in global growth 
was expected to continue given  Brexit . The euro area economies were directly 
affected through trade and private sector’s sentiment , while the US and Japan ese 
economies  were  affected  mainly through exchange rates.  Asian economies were  
indirectly affected through exports to the euro are a and financial market volatility. 
Nonetheless, Asian economies  were expected to  slowly pick up thanks to fiscal 
measures and an improved export outlook that benefited from the technology 
cycle with the launch of new product models.  Meanwhile, China’s grow th 
continued to slow down as a result of ongoing economic reforms and measures 
to foster macroeconomic stability . 
The Thai economy expanded at a gradual pace on the back of public 
spending and tourism that continued to grow despite having slowed down from  
the previous quarter. Private consumption steadily expanded due to improved 
employment in the service sector, the gradual recovery in farm income , and partly 
a result of temporary factors. Meanwhile, export s continued to contract owing to 
a slowdown in Tha iland’s trading partners  especially Asia n economies, and thus 
overall investment remained low . 
Headline  inflation  fell slightly  on account  of fresh  food and energy  prices , 
while  core inflation  remained  stable  due to low demand  pressures.  Looking  ahead,  
headline  inflation  was expected  to return to the lower  bound  of the target  band  
within  this year in line with the previous  assessment,  although  the timing  would  
largely  depend  on developments  in global  oil prices.  Monetary Policy Report  September 2016   20 2.1 The global economy   
 Advanced Economie s 
Advanced economies gradually recovered 
driven by private consumption  but faced greater risks 
following  Brexit (Chart 2.1).  
The result of the referendum held o n June 23, 
2016, for the United Kingdom (UK) to leave the 
European Union (EU) (Brexit) dampened economic 
growth in the UK through declines in business 
investment and confidence. The impact of Brexit on UK 
economic growth was expected to increase , 
particularly in 2017. (BOX: The impact of Brexit on 
Global and Thai economies)  
Euro area economies in the second quarter 
of 2016 grew by 0.3 percent (qoq sa), down from 0.5 
percent  in the previous quarter  on account of domestic 
demand1/. This was mainly attributed to the slowdown 
in investment, which was partly due to an acceleration 
in construction work in the previous quarter when the 
weather was unusually warm, together with the closure 
of oil refineries in France after worker strikes in May. 
Meanwhile, net exports improve d. Recent economic 
indicators in August show ed more apparent impact 
from Brexit, as reflected in lower consumer confidence 
in the euro area and business confidence in Germany.  
Looking ahead, the euro area economies were 
expected  to recover slowly with increased  risks from 
(1) the adverse impact from Brexit on the euro area 
through trade and uncertainties surrounding the new 
trade deals between UK and the EU which would

uncertainty that could stem from  elections in many 
countries, especially in France, Italy , and the 
Netherlands, which could allow anti -EU groups to gain 
more s upport; and (3) risks in the European banking  
sector following the negative interest rate policy that 
further depressed net interest margin (NIM) in the face 
of lower credit demand amid greater economic risks. 
The Committee would continue to closely monitor 
these risks  going forward . 
The U.S. economy in the second quarter of 
2016 recovered gradually and expanded  by 1.1 
percent (qoq saar) , up from 0.8 percent in the 
previous quarter  on the back of a steady expansion 
in private consumption . However, investment was held 
back,  especially in en ergy-related and manufacturing 
sector s, as a result  of depressed  oil and commodity 
prices, the appreciation of the US dollar , and weak 
external  demand. Moreover, inventor ies decline d for 
three  consecutive quarter s due to decline in capital 
goods as investment contracted. Latest economic 
indicators reflected a slight  improvement  in many  
manufacturing  industries . P rivate consumption 
expanded on the back of continually increasing  
employment and income . However, exports remained 
weak  in line with trading  partners’ economic conditions.  
In the period ahead , the US economic recovery 
would  likely proceed at a gradual pace , spurred by 
consumption as supported by the labor market 
recovery . A continuing  recovery in consumption would  
benef it production in some industries , but weak 
investment would  likely persist particularly in the 
energy sector . Moreover, uncertainties might  arise  
from (1) the p residential election in November 2016 Monetary Policy Report  September 2016   22 and its implications for economic polic ies, (2) external 
factors such as the impact of Brexit  that could  induce 
US dollar  appreciation , and weaken ed demand in the 
UK and the euro area. However, the continued 
economic recovery especially with improvements in the 
labor market and the gradual rise in inflation 
strengthened the case for the Federal Reserve  to raise 
the federal funds rate in the period ahead . 
The Japanese economy gr ew by 0.2 percent  
(qoq sa) , down from 0.5 percent in the previous 
quarter. Despite the government’s accelerated 
spending on  repair and  reconstruction after the 
earth quake, c onsumption and exports remain ed weak 
as confidence  and demand from trading partners 
continued to decline . Recent economic indicators 
suggested some  improvements in the manufacturing 
sector as outstanding purchase orders picked up.  
However, consumption  was still  weak  overall as both 
wage growth and consumer confidence remained low.  
Looking ahead , the Japanese economy would  
gradually expand , supported by government stimulus 
measure s such as supplementary budgets, a delay in 
the implementation  of the sales tax increase from April 
2017 to October 2019 , as well as continued monetary 
policy easing. However, m ajor ri sks remain ed from (1) 
volatility in the global financial market  after Brexit, (2) 
potential yen appreciation, and (3) the transmission of 
monetary and fiscal policy to the economy  which might 
be less than previously expected . 
Asia (excluding China and Japan)  
 Asian economie s recovered at a gradual  pace  
on the back of  government  expenditure, the initial 
recovery in exports , and continued expansion in in 
consumption. However, growth projections for the Monetary Policy Report  September 2016   23 Asian economies  over the period ahead  was lower 
than the assessment  in the  previous  Monetary Policy 
Report , mainly due to Brexit . 
 Asian econom ies (excluding China and 
Japan)  improved in the second quarter of 2016  (Chart 
2.2) on account of consumption and public investment , 
together with impro ved exports in many countries, s uch 
as Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, Malaysia , and 
Singapore, as new products in the technology c ycle 
were  to be launched  in the third quarter. Private 
consumption continued to expand. Meanwhile, private 
investment slowed down due to overcapacity in the 
manufacturing sector and weakened confidence 
stemming from the slow  economic recovery of trading 
partners. Latest indicators pointed to a slight slowdown 
which could be attributed to temporary factors namely 
the Ramadan which accelerat ed the production  and 
delivery of merchandises in the second quarter and 
deferred car purchase in anticipation of  newer models 
at the end of the third quarter.  
In the period a head, Asian economie s 
(excluding China and Japan) would recover gradually 
following growth -accommo dating  fiscal policy, gradual 
improvement in exports , and continued expansion in 
private consumption. However , the recovery of Asian 
economies in the period ahead might be weak er than 
previously assessed in the last Monetary Policy Report , 
due mainly to Brexit . This was particularly the case for 
Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, and Taiwan, given 
their closer linkage  to the UK and the euro area through 
trade, direct investment , and financial channels .

 China’s economic  growth continued to 
moderate , particularly  investment growth that was  
affected by  ongoing economic reforms and measures 
to foster macroeconomic stability . 
 The Chinese economy in the second 
quarter of 20 16 expanded at 6.7 percent as in  the 
previous quarter.  The slowdown  in private 
consumption wa s compensated  by improvements in 
exports and public investment  in infrastructure . 
However, recent economic indicators (Chart  2.3) still 
point ed to a slowdown in economic growth, particularly 
investment in the  manufacturing and housing  sectors . 
This was due to the ongoing economic reforms to 
decrease investment in sectors with high degrees of 
overcapacity, together with  measures to foster 
macroeconomic stability that aimed to curb  property  
speculation  and debt accumulation, dampe ning 
activities in the real estate sector.   
 Looking ahead, China’s economic slowdown 
would continue  further as a consequence of ongoing 
economic reforms. The impact of Brexit  on the Chinese 
economy however appeared  to be  limited , as the share 
of Chinese e xports to the UK and the euro area 
account ed for only 3.3 percent of GDP . Meanwhile, t he 
impact of Brexit through direct investment and the 
financial sector would  also likely be  limited. Financial 
stability risks in China  remain ed largely unchanged  but 
continued to warrant close monitoring , namely th e high 
levels of corporate debt , and defaults in  bank loans, 
bond markets, and shadow banking.  These risks in part 
prompted  the Chinese authority to be more cautious in 
easing monetary policy  further .

The Thai economy in the second quarter of 
2016 continued to expand  from th e previous quarter 
(Chart 2.4)  on the back of  a steady  growth in public 
spending and tourism , although both drivers slowed 
down slightly from the previous quarter . Private 
consumption  continued to expand on account of 
employment in the service sector , the moderate 
recovery in f arm income , and, in part, temporary 
factors . The export sector, however , continued to 
contract in tandem with the slowdown in  major trading 
partners’ economie s, especially  in Asia. Consequently, 
overall investment lingered remained subdued .  
Public spending and tourism continued to expand, 
although both driv ers slowed down slightly after having 
accelerated  in the previous  quarter .  
Disbursement of the fiscal budget remained 
on track for both current and capital  expenditure , 
particularly , the expedited disbursement by the 
National Health Security Fund in the previous quarter 
and inves tment on road transportation.  However, 
spending showed some sign s of a slowdown after an 
expedited disbursement in earlier periods  (Chart 2.5) . 
Meanwhile, capit al expenditure  of state -owned 
enterprise s continued to be well disbursed,  especially 
for major projects in the rail infrastructure development 
plan. In addition, d isbursement was on track for the 
measures to improve living standards in provincial  
sub-districts.  
Tourism continued to expand  but at a slower 
rate as a re sult of the decline  in the number of Chinese 
tourists after having accelerated in the previous quarter 
(Chart 2.6) . The number of tourists from other

was expected to expand despite some downside risks, 
namely (1)  the government’s attempt to curb zero -
dollar tours  and measures to set minimum prices for 
tour package s, and (2) concerns of some tourists  over 
bombings in the seven provinces  in August , although 
the impact m ight prove to be short -lived as in the past.  
The service sector  sustained  a robust growth  
in all industries ( Chart 2.7 ), especially for tourism -
related businesses such as trade, hotels and restaurants,  
and transport  of passengers. These industries all 
benefited  from the higher number of  tourists.  Meanwhile, 
the real estate and telecommunication  sectors  displayed 
a marginal slowdown after the end of government 
stimulus measures on the  real estate sector and 
promotion al campaign s during the launch of 4G 
services . The shipping  industry grew , albeit  at a slower 
rate as exports remained subdued . On the contrary, 
the service sector continued to be  a major economic 
driving force  and also help ed absorb labor that  had 
moved out of the agricultural  sector during the drought  
(Chart 2.8), especially those with low skills.

lower  demand for business credit for investment  
purposes . Moreover , permitted areas for constructions

Source : Office of the National Economic and Social Development BoardIndexMonetary Policy Report  September 2016   29 Headline inflation softened  slightly, averaging 
0.20 percent (yoy) in the first two months of the third 
quarter (Chart 2.13) . This was  due to  falling prices of 
fresh food and retail oil . The decline  in fresh food prices 
was due to increase d supply of  vegetable s and fruits  
produce  after the drought subsided . Domestic retail oil 
prices fell in line with global crude oil  prices , as oil 
supply from the US and OPEC remained  elevated,  
while the global  economic recovery  faced additional  
risks. 
Core inflation average d at 0.78 percent (yoy)  
in the first two months of the third quarter  (Chart 2.14) , 
close to the previous quarter . This was due to weak 
demand -pull inflationary pressure  following the gradual  
recovery of domestic economy, as reflected  by underlying  
inflation indicators that remained at low level s (Chart 
2.15) . Moreover, p rices of most goods and services  
in the core inflation basket remained unchanged, 
indicating limitations faced by  business es in making  
price adjustment s. 
Short -term inflation expectations stood close to 
that in the previous period.  One-year-ahead inflation 
expectation  by firms  in August 2016 and  by professional  
economists in Se ptember 2016 stood at 1.9  percent  
and 1.6  percent,  respectively. Medium -term inflation 
expectations remained near the inflation target at 2.5 
percent (Chart  2.16) . 
Looking ahead, the Committee expected  headline  
inflation to rise gradually due to the base effect of low 
oil prices . Headline inflation was also expected to 
return to the low er bound of the target  band  within this 
year as previously assessed . Nonetheless, the timing 
would largely depend on developments in global crude 
prices . In addition, the recovery of domestic demand 
continued to warrant close monitoring.

Calculations of percentage change from last quarter, seasonally adjusted , by Bank of ThailandMonetary Policy Report  September 2 016  31 The impact of Brexit on global  and Thai economies  
Brexit, which resulted in heighted uncertainties in the global economy and global 
financial markets, was an important factor underpinning a downward revision of global and Thai 
economic growth forecasts from the projection published in the previous Monetary Policy 
Report .  
Most analysts expected that Brexit would set back the UK economy in the period  
ahead.  Domestic spending would slow down due to weakened business and consumer 
confidence. Moreover, foreign direct investment in the UK might decline  significantly  given that  
the UK was the financial center of the European Union ( EU), and was highly dependent on 
capital from the EU. The impact on trade , however , might not be apparent in the short run as a 
weaker pound could benefit exports and tourism. This is because t he EU was a major export 
destination for the UK, accounting for 39 percent of the UK’s total exports or 8 percent of GDP. 
Nonetheless , the medium - and longer -term impacts would depend on the terms of negotiations 
with the EU , while the outcomes could have implications on the unity of the EU in the future.  
Global economic impact of Brexit  
Brexit could impact the global econ omy through three main cha nnels as follows.  
(1)  Trade channel  
The UK’s economic slowdown could dampen global  trade. In particular, the effect would 
come from the UK’s trade with the EU  due to their close economic relations hips. The EU’s 
exports to the UK accounted for 6.5 percent  of total EU exports or 2.4 percent of GDP. I f the 
impact of  Brexit on the EU economy w ere 
to be  limited, other countries would also 
be less affected due to their low trade 
dependence with the UK (Chart 1) . The 
impact of Brexit on Asian economies were  
asse ssed to be not significant because 
each country’s exports to the UK 
accounted for less than 3 percent of their 
total exports. Singapore and Hong Kong, 
as the financial centers of Asia, were  the 
exceptions due to their large share of 
service exports to the UK. However, Asian 
countries , including Thailand , which  had 
closer trade link ages  with the EU could be 
indirectly affected if the EU economies 
weaken ed significantly .  
(2)  Confidence  channel  
The unexpected outcome of the Brexit referendum induced panic among investors and 
spurred up significant volatility in the financial markets  with the risk -off sentiment . As a result, 
global stock indices  declined significantly  especially in the advanced eco nomies , and t he pound 
and the euro depreciated , while safe -haven currencies rallied noticeably. Although f inancial 
market volatility subsided as the outlook gradually became clearer , risks remained owing to 
political uncertain ty and the stability of regio nal economic blocs. Within  the EU, the intensified

Source : CEICMonetary Policy Report  September 2 016  32 anti-integration sentiment which could give rise to a call for a referendum in many countries 
similar to  the UK. For example, the anti -EU group in Italy gained increasingly greater  popularity. 
The rising political uncer tainty would weigh on investor  confidence in the EU economic 
outlook . Moreover, this could add more pressures on the European banking sector that 
is now fac ing with elevated levels of  non-performing loans during  the economic 
slowdown since 2008 . In the case of Italy, stock prices in the banking sector fell by more than 
15 perc ent after Brexit. In the period  ahead, increased financial stability risks in the banking 
sector and a growth slowdown in the EU, the world ’s second largest economy, would affect 
global trade and investment as well as global economic recovery.  
(3) Investment channel  
UK’s slower economic growth would weigh on  returns on investment in the UK, 
particularly the EU’s foreign direct investment (FDI) in  the UK which was as high as 12 percent 
of the EU’s total outward FDI. On the other hand, other countries in the region would not be 
affected much due to their low reliance on the UK’s direct investment. However, negotiations 
on post -Brexit economic relati ons between the EU and t he UK remained highly uncertain, and 
that could affect investor  confidence. With an aim to support the economies, further monetary 
policy easing by central banks in major advanced economies, especially those affected by 
Brexit, coul d prolong the low for longer environment . This could encourage the search -for-yield 
behavior which would affect capital flows for some time.  
The impact of Brexit on the Thai economy  
The major impact of Brexit on Thailand would be via the trade channel  through the 
income effect from the slowdown in the EU economies and those with close trade linkages with 
the EU and the UK (Chart 2) . Meanwhile , investment could experience higher volatility, 
especially in portfolio investment flows.

Direct effect Indirect effectMonetary Policy Report  September 2 016  33   (1)  Trade channel  
The direct impact of the UK’s economic slowdown on Thai exports would be 
limited  as the UK’s share in Thai total exports accounted for  only 1.8 percent in 2015. However, 
Thai export s could be indirectly impacted  by the income effect owing to the  economic 
slowdown in (1) the EU  which currently accounted for 8.5 percent of total Thai exports and (2) 
other major economies with close trade links with the EU and the UK , such as the US, 
China , and ASEAN, which altogether accounted for almost half of to tal Thai exports (Chart 3).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Thai exports highly dependent  on EU and UK markets (Chart 4)  included  those with 
high income elasticity such as jewelries and those with intense price competition such as 
processed chicken, canned pineapple, and canned fish. These  products would suffer from both 
a slowdown in trading partners’ economies and volatile exchang e rates. However, such 
products accounted for a small share of total Thai exports.  In the future, if the import tariffs 
of trade between the UK and the EU were to be  increased  from zero percent, the UK’s import 
demand from the EU could fall. This might  bring about trade opportunities for other countries. 
For instance , Thailand could benefit from exporting more processed food, automotive, textile , 
and apparels to the UK.  
(2)  Tourism  channel  
Brexit could affect Thailand’s tourism sector. Accounting for 15.9  percent of total 
tourists, UK and EU (excluding Russia) travelers are  significantly  important to Thailand.  
Brexit could hamper confidence in future income amid an economic slowdown. Also, travelling 
costs could increase due to the weaker pound and euro. H owever, the adverse impact might  
not be seen until 2017 as most Europeans plan their trips on average at least six months in 
advance.   
(3)  Investment  channel  
The Brexit aftermath could affect each type of capital flow s differently, with most 
apparent impa ct on portfolio investment.  After Brexit, Thailand recorded higher -than-
average capital inflows in both debt and equity markets, consistent with other emerging 
markets. This could be attributed to both monetary policy easing in advanced economies and 
expec tations of the Fed eral Reserve  to delay a policy rate hike. Looking ahead, monetary policy

and consequen tly impact capital flow volatility.  
The impact on FDI was expected to be limited.  In the past, Thailand’s dependence 
on FDI from the UK and the EU has been small. Moreover, capital inflows were influenced 
mostly  by the strength of domestic fundamentals acting as a  pull factor.  
While global financial volatility subsided somewhat after having surged during Brexit, 
future uncertainty remain ed high. Implications from Brexit could rekindle  volatility in financial 
markets and the global economy. Therefore, the following developments require d close 
monitoring: (1) the timeframe  of the UK withdrawal from the EU, which could  take at least two 
years after the UK’s formal notification  to the EU , (2) outcome of negotiations on the UK and 
EU relationship , and (3) repercussions of the Brexit impact on other countries.  Monetary and Financial StabilityMonetary Policy Report September  2016    35 3. Monetary and Financial Stability

1/ VIX (Volatility Index) is an indicator for stock market 
volatility, measured by implied volatility of option prices of 
the S&P500.  Volatility in global financial markets surged temporarily following the Brexit 
referendum and led a number of advanced economies to prolong monetary policy 
easing further ( “low for longer”), which in turn induced investors to increase their 
holdings of emerging market equity and debt. On the domestic front, monetary 
conditions remained accommodative, with money market rates remaining at low 
levels. Meanwhile, corporate costs of finan cing through the debt market increased 
slightly from the previous quarter but still remained low overall. With regard to 
exchange rates, the baht strengthen ed from both external and domestic factors.  
Overall macro -financial stability remained sound. This was reflected in the 
high levels of capital buffers and loan loss provision maintained by commercial banks 
to cushion against risk s from de clining c redit quality, as well as the financial standing 
of large corporates which remained strong. While the search -for-yield behavior 
remained under the prolonged low interest rate environment, there were still limited 
signs of risk underpricing. Nevertheless, there remained pockets of risks that 
warranted monitoring as follow s. First, a lthough household debt accumula tion had 
decelerated and improvement in farm income would benefit debt serviceability in the 
future, already elevated household debt  level and uncertainties in the economic 
recovery would require a certain period of necessary adjustments on part of the 
households. Second, d ebt serviceability of the corporate sector, particularly for SMEs , 
was affected by the slow economic recovery. Third, a  slowdown in the condominium 
market was expected, as housing demand declined after the government ’s stimulus 
measures e nded.

Bank of England decided to ease its monetary 
policy further on August 4, 2016. The result of both 
Brexit and continued monetary policy easing by 
major central banks, particularly  the Bank of Japan 
and the European Central Bank, led investors to  
expect that interest rates and bond yields in 
advanced markets  would remain low for longer . 
This prompted capital flows to return to emerging 
markets  (EMs) in search of higher yields , where by 
institutional investors, mutual funds, and exchange 
traded funds (ETFs) started to increase the weight 
of EMs in their asset allocation. Consequently, this 
led to increased capital inflows into EMs, in both 
equity and bond markets  (Chart 3.2) , which 
resulted in a greater increase in EMs capital market 
indices ( MSCI EMs2/) relative to  other markets after 
Brexit  (Chart 3.3).  However, capital flows into EMs 
slowed down somewhat at the end  of August 
following comments by some members of the 
Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) that 
alluded the  possib ility of an increase in the federal 
funds rate in the remaining meetings in 2016.3/

July and September 2016 (Chart 3.4).  Meanwhile, 
government bond yields remained at low levels, 
despite  edging up slightly from levels seen at the 
end of the second quarter (Chart 3.5).  This was 
driven by improved investor sentiments following 
the acceptance of the draft constitution  in the 
referendum on August 7, 2016 and the better -than-
expected GDP figure for the second quarter of 
2016. Investors also expected a possible rate 
increase  by the Federal Reserve by the end of this

indicators.

government bond yields were largely stable relative 
to the previous quarter. As a result, cost s of 
financing through c orporate bonds rose slightly 
along with the increase in government bond yields . 
However, overall financing costs remained below 
last year’s averages (Chart 3.6).   
The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) 
Index and the Market for Alternative Investment 
(mai) Index rose from the previous quarter (Chart 
3.7 and 3.8). The rebound was attributable to 
foreign investors who continued to increase 
investment in the Thai equity markets, partly 
reflecting the return of capital flows to emerging  
markets under the low-for-longer environment . This 
was also supported by improvements in the Thai 
economy  and performances of listed companies 
during  the first half of the year, together with  better 
investor sentiments after the referendum on the 
draft constitution. However , SET and mai indices 
sharply fell in early September to levels similar to 
the end of the second quarter. While local

The baht appreciated against the US 
dollar relative to the end of the previous 
quarter, in line with movements of most 
regional currencies, as a result of the low -for- 
longer environment  that spurred  continued  capital 
inflows into assets in Asia and Thailand. Additional 
factors driving the baht to strength included the 
result of the draft constitution referendum and 
better -than-expected GDP figure for the second 
quarter. However, the baht and regional currencies 
depreciat ed slightly in some periods, partly owing 
to the appreciation of the US d ollar. Factors 
supporting the US  dollar were better -than-expected 
US economic indicators, such as employment and 
production figures, and comments by some 
members of the FOMC that a po licy rate hike this 
year might  be appropriate. On September 13, 
2016, the baht closed at 34.89 baht per US dollar, 
up 0.7 percent from the end of the previous quarter. 
This was in line with the Nominal Effective 
Exchange Rate which closed at 105.69, up 0.5  
percent from the previous quarter, as the baht 
strengthened  against major and most regional 
currencies (Chart 3 .9 and 3.10).     
Baht movements were  somewhat more 
volatile in August  but relatively stable compared 
with regional currencies (Chart 3.11 ). Going 
forward, global capital flows and exchange  rates 
were expected  to remain volatile in view of 
uncertainties in policy directions of major economies 
and continuing sensitivity of the global financial 
markets under the  low-for-longer environment.

Costs of financing for firms and deposit

Although o verall demand for new financing rose 
across the board relative to  the first quarter  of 2016 , 
demand was concentrated in large corporates and 
the service sector. Going forward, as the economy 
was projected to recover only gradually , the outlook 
for a slowdown in credit growth was expected, 
thereby  reducing  the need for deposit mobilization.

(added October 2015)Monetary Policy Report September  2016    40 Total corporate financing increased 
between May and July 2016 relative to the first 
quarter in all channels  (Chart 3.12) , mainly 
thanks to increased fund raising by large 
corporates. Overall commercial bank loan growth 
accelerated, primarily driven by demand for 
domestic and offshore merger and acquisition 
deals. However, e xcluding loans for these 
purposes, new loans continued to decline from the 
first quarter of 2016 , especially loans to the 
manufacturing sector  given that  private investment 
remained low.  In addition , some large corporates, 
especially those in the transport and logistics,  
telecommunication , and food processing sectors, 
shifted to bond financing as cost s of corporate bond 
issuance remained at relatively low levels. As a 
result, the amount of funds raised from the bond 
market between May and July 2016 increased from 
the firs t quarter  of 2016 . Funds raised from equity 
financing also increased, mainly by telecommunication  
and trade businesses.  
New loans to households4/ between May 
and July 2016 increased at a slower rate relative 
to the first quarter of 2016  (Chart 3.13).  The 
slowdown was seen across the board, noticeably  in 
mortgage loans which had earlier accelerated due 
to the government’s real estate stimulus measures  
Meanwhile, new loans from specialized financial 
institutions and savings cooperatives accelerated 
somewhat. The slowdown in new loans to households 
was consistent with the  Credit Conditions Survey in 
the second quarter of 2016. The Survey indicated 
that financial institutions continued to maintain tight

adjusted credit outstanding of other depository 
corporations (ODCs), which include commercial banks, 
specialized financial institutions, finance companies, 
savings cooperatives, and money market funds .

instea d turn to  non-banks.  
Deposits outstanding at the end of July 
declined from the end of April 2016, especially 
for corporate deposits (Chart 3.14).  Growth of 
deposits including bills of exchange (B/E) remained 
low given weak loan growth and the subdued 
outlook that reduced the need for deposit 
mobilization. This was reflected in the low level  
of interest rates on special deposit products  
(Chart 3.15).  
Overall, the loan -to-deposit (including 
B/E) ratio rose  from the first quarter of 2016 due 
to increases in new loans and declining deposits 
(Chart 3.16).  
Macro -financial stability   
Overall macro -financial stability remained 
sound , despite de clining  loan quality, particularly in 
the SME sector, due to sluggish economic 
recovery. In addition , stability of financial 
institutions remained sound as commercial banks 
continued to monitor credit quality closely and 
maintained high levels of capital buffers and loan 
loss provisions to provide cushion against risks 
from declining  loan quality. Meanwh ile, the search -
for-yield behavior continued but systemic risks 
remained limited.   
The quality of commercial bank loans at 
the end of the second quarter of 2016 declined  
from the previous quarter given the sluggish 
economic recovery.  The ratio of non -perfo rming 
loans to total loans (NPL ratio) rose from 2.64 at the 
end of the first quarter  of 2016  to 2.74, attributable 
to the increase in NPL ratios of both business 
loans, especially loans to SMEs, and consumer 
loans (Chart 3.17).  The NPL ratio of SMEs rose 
from 3.69 at the end of the first quarter of 2016 to

    2016 Q2 Monetary Policy Report September  2016    42 3.77. The  NPL increase was due to  loans extended 
to the manufacturing and wholesale and retail trade 
sectors. The NPL ratio of loans to large corporates 
also increased but re mained low at 1.85 , while the 
NPL ratio of consumer loans edged up slightly due 
to de clining  quality of housing and personal loans 
(Chart 3.18).  
Despite declining  loan quality, stability 
of overall commercial banks remained sound as 
banks maintained high l evels of capital buffers and 
loan loss provisions, as reflected in the actual -to-
regulatory loan loss provision ratio at 161.3 
percent , together with  the capital adequacy ratio at 
17.5 percent  that was well above the regulatory 
requirement of 8.5 percent.  
The search -for-yield behavior continued 
under the prolonged low interest rate 
environment. With regard to equity market 
movements,  the turnover ratio in  the SET and  mai 
increased from the previous quarter while the SET 
Index picked up  following the accep tance of the 
draft constitution in the referendum and improved 
performance of listed companies in the second 
quarter. However, in early September, the SET 
Index was down sharply owing to  sales by domestic 
proprietary traders and institutional investors. As a 
result, the price -earnings ratios (P/E) for the 
SET and mai declined below the levels seen at 
the end of the second quarter  but remained 
higher than  historical averages (Chart 3. 19). 
However,  risks to the overall stability of the 
financial system were expected to be limited  as 
transactions were mainly done  in cash , while 
margin loans remained low at 13 percent of total 
transaction value as of July 2016.  
With regard to the domestic bond 
markets , corporate bond issu ance continued to 
rise over time . Overall, most corporate bond

Source : ThaiBMA, Department of Business Development and Stock Exchange of  ThailandMonetary Policy Report September  2016    44 (Chart 3.21).  Recently , investors shifted from  
MMF s, which focuse d on low risk and highly liquid 
short -term debt securities, to Daily FI in search for 
higher yields. As Daily FI could invest in long -
maturity bonds  and higher credit risk bonds , NAV 
of Daily FI had greater volatility linked to interest 
rate movements and changes in credit ratings of 
issuers. Investor confidence, if undermined, could 
lead to mass unit redemptions , and spark volatility 
in the money market. This is sue need ed to be 
monitored , together with promoting proper 
understanding  among investors of the risks involved  
in each type of investment. At the same time, 
growth of foreign investment funds (FIF s) was 
also observed. FIF s recently turn to increase  
investment in countries which had higher  sovereign  
credit ratings such as the United Arab Emirates, 
Luxemburg, Hong Kong , and Qatar, focusing  
mostly in investment -grade bonds.  
As an alternative for those seeking yields 
higher than bank deposit rates, savings 
cooperatives’  deposits and shares gained traction 
among savers , with growth sustained over the 
recent period (Chart 3.22).  The main reason was 
that savings cooperatives’  deposit rates and 
dividend yields were higher than those offered by 
commercial  banks. The search -for-yield behavior 
was also exhibited by savings cooperatives, as 
evidenced by the increasing proportion of their 
equity assets with higher risks and expected 
returns. Nonetheless, equity -based assets accounted  
for only 1.5 percent of th eir total assets  (Chart 3.23) . 
Overall, systemic risks stemming from 
the search -for-yield behavior were still limited 
and signs of broad -based underpricing  of risks  
were not present . Nonetheless, t he Committee 
would continue to monitor the search -for-yield 
behavior closely . This applied to both investors,

funds that tended to invest in riskier assets such as 
equity, non -investment grad e bonds and unra ted 
bonds amid  the low for longer environment. 
Vulnerabilities in the financial system that could 
accumulate as a result of financial institutions 
competing to extend loans to large corporates, 
together with concentration of loan s in some 
business sectors , also warranted close monitoring . 
3.3 Non-financial sectors  
Household sector  
Households’ debt serviceability continued 
to fall, as reflected by rising NPL levels. High debt 
levels and gradual economic recovery affected 
household economic and financial activity . 
However, slower growth in household debt and 
improved farm income would partly help improve 
the financial position of households going forward.  
Households’ debt serviceability  decreased 
slightly , as reflected in the increase in the NPL 
ratio of consumer loans from 2.58  percent  in the 
first quarter of 2016 to 2.60 in the second quarter, 
mainly due to lower credit  quality of home loans. 
With weaker households’ debt serviceability in  
the recent period prompting banks to be stricter in 
credit extension, some households shifted to 
borrowing from non -banks, particularly in the  
case of personal loans under regulation (PLR) . 
Consequently, i n contrast with the slowdown in 
commercial banks’ credit extension , PLR growth 
accelerated  (Chart 3.24) . Given that PLR issued by 
non-banks were mainly extended  to low -income 
households, vulnerability in the household sector  
could accumulate in the future, which would  need 
to be monitored closely.

In the second quarter of 2016, performance

Businesses ’ ability to gen erate revenues and 
profits  improved, as reflected in the operating profit 
margin s and return s on assets of most businesses 
(Chart 3.27).  Increased profits in  some sectors 
were driven by sales growth and effective cost 
management, notably in the real estate and 
wholesale and retail trade sectors. While the 
petroleum and petrochemical sector continued to 
experience sales contraction, profits improved 
thanks to inventory profits that were realized from 
higher oil prices  (Chart 3.28).  
Business debt stabilized at low levels  as 
reflected in the low median D/E ratio at 0.7. Overall 
debt serviceability remained sound  with the 
median ICR at 5.8, well above the international 
standard of 1.5 (Chart 3.29).  Businesses in most 
sectors were able to  manage o perating costs and  
reduce interest costs  more effectively . This could 
be done by  issuing debt instruments with lower 
funding costs than borrowing from banks. However, 
debt serviceability of some business sectors, such

of continuing low prices of crude oil and coal. Risks 
in some sect ors continued to warrant monitoring. 
Examples included those  sectors  that were 
sensitive to sluggish economic recovery , especially 
small enterprises w ith limited access to financing. 
Recent data on listed companies with assets in the 
two lowest quintiles i ndicated that they could be 
facing liquidity constraints  due to persistent losses . 
Using these smaller companies as proxy for  
non-listed  SMEs, it could be implied that debt 
serviceability of SMEs appeared to decline . This 
was consistent with the NPL ratio  of SMEs at the 
end of the second quarter of 2016 which was on an 
upward trend (Chart 3.30).  
Real estate  sector  
The property market in Bangkok and its 
vicinities slowed down in the second quarter of 
     after the government’s stimulus measures  
expired . Risks of unsold stock of condominium 
units, especially projects along the mass transit 
lines, would warrant continuing monitoring.  
The property market in Bangkok and its 
vicinities slowed down in the second quarter of 
2016 after the government ’s real esta te stimulus 
measures  ended in April 2016, as reflected in the  
reduction of new housing loan approvals by 
commercial banks (Chart 3.31).  On the supply 
side, d evelopers also adjusted by launching fewer 
new projects and focusing instead on selling 
outstanding units so as  to benefit from the 
government ’s measures , as reflected in the 
slowdown of new residential projects launched in 
Bangkok and its vicinities  (Char t 3.32).    
Demand was expected to slow down in the 
second half of 2016 compared with the first half as  
part of  future property purchases had been brought

2016 Q2 Monetary Policy Report September  2016    48 forward to benefit from  the government ’s stimulus 
measures. On the supply side, the number of new 
projects launched  gradually picked up in the 
second half of the year compared with the first half  
of the year , notably new condominium projects 
along the mass transit lines. Preliminary assessment 
indicated that the new supply was not a concern, 
given the few  number of new projects launched in 
the first  half. Moreover, the total number of new 
projects launched in 2016 appeared to be below 
levels in the past. However, risks associated with 
the increase in outstanding supply would warrant 
monitoring, especially if the new projects were  
located in areas with plenty outstanding condominium  
units, for instance units priced at  2-5 million baht 
along the Purple Line route and units priced  over 5 
million baht along the Green Line extension route 
(Table  3.3). 
Additional issues to be monitored include 
implication  of the Land and Building s Tax Act and 
the mass transit line extension projects which will 
affect  land and house  prices. Land supply was 
anticipated to increase as  the act would  impose 
greater tax burden s on landowners. Extension of 
the mass transit lines to suburban areas would 
create new areas for development for property 
developers. As a result, land prices would not likely  
rise as sharply as in the past.  
Fiscal sector  
Fiscal stability  remained  sound, as reflected  
in public debt that remained below the fiscal 
sustainability threshold and the treasury cash 
balance that was sufficient to meet unexpected 
fiscal needs. Nonetheless, pressures on fiscal 
stability would likely increase from (1) additio nal 
borrowings needed for investment in transportation 
infrastructure projects  and (2) future fiscal burden 
arising from recently approved stimulus measures.

Source : AREA and calculations by Bank of ThailandMonetary Policy Report September  2016    49 Fiscal stability remained sound , as 
reflected  in the public debt to GDP ratio that 
remained below the fiscal sustainability threshold of 
60 percent. As of July 2016, the ratio stood at 42.9, 
slightly down from 44.1 percent in April 2016 (Chart 
3.33).  The decline was due to repayments  of 
principal by the Financial Institutions Development 
Fund Phase II, B.E. 2545 (FIDF 3), Thai Airways 
International Public Company Limited, the Bank for 
Agricultural and Agricultural Cooperatives, together 
with bond redemptions by the Provincial Electricity 
Authority. In  addition, the stronger baht lowered the 
remaining outstanding balance in baht terms. 
However, the central government continued to 
increase borrowing to finance its budget deficit , and  
to lend to state -owned enterprises for investment in 
(1) the Mass Rapid  Transit Authority of Thailand’s 
projects on the Green, Blue , and Purple Line s and 
(2) the State Railway of Thailand’s projects to 
improve railways which were  deemed  unsafe for 
road transportation. Meanwhile, the treasury cash 
balance increased from the pr evious quarter. At the 
end of July 2016, the treasury cash balance stood 
at 248 billion baht, up from 206 billion  baht at the 
end of April 2016. The increase was primarily 
attributed to transfer of receipts from the auction of 
900 MHz spectrum licenses and  digital TV licenses.  
Going forward, pressures on fiscal 
stability  were  likely to increase  due to (1) non -
budgetary borrowing for investment in the 
transportation infrastructure projects under the 
Urgent Transportation Action Plan and (2) the 
additional fi scal burden from quasi -fiscal activities 
that were  part of the economic stimulus packages, 
such as compensation for the interest rate 
differentials to specialized financial institutions 
taking part in the soft loan program s.
